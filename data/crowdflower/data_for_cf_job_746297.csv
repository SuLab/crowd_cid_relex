"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous <span class=""chemical"">Nimodipine</span> West European <span class=""disease"">Stroke</span> Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between <span class=""chemical"">nimodipine</span>-induced <span class=""disease"">reduction in blood pressure</span> (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in <span class=""disease"">acute stroke</span>. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of <span class=""disease"">BP reduction</span>. </p><p>METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of <span class=""disease"">ischemic stroke</span> (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) <span class=""chemical"">nimodipine</span> (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) <span class=""chemical"">nimodipine</span> (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. </p><p>RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). <span class=""chemical"">Nimodipine</span> treatment resulted in a statistically significant <span class=""disease"">reduction in systolic BP</span> (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between <span class=""disease"">DBP reduction</span> and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a <span class=""disease"">DBP reduction</span> of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable <span class=""disease"">death</span> or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and <span class=""disease"">death</span> alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose <span class=""chemical"">nimodipine</span> after <span class=""disease"">acute stroke</span>. For low-dose <span class=""chemical"">nimodipine</span>, the results were not conclusive.
