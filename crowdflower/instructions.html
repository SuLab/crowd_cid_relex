Title: Finding diseases caused by drugs



<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>While most drugs are generally beneficial, some drugs unfortunately can cause side effects. When this happens, it is said that the drug causes, or <em>induces</em> the disease.</p>
<p>In this task, you will be helping scientists find drug induced diseases from a piece of text.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a section of text.<br>
    A small number of <span class="chemical">drugs</span> and <span class="disease">diseases</span> have been highlighted in the text. All occurrences of the same drug or disease have been highlighted.</li>

  <li>Read through the list of potential drug induced diseases and pick those which are supported by the text.</li>

</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "<span class="disease">Rombin cystitis</span> is a rare but potentially serious complication of high-dose <span class="chemical">wertaximab</span> therapy administered prior to taking an X-ray."
      </li>
      <li>
        In the above sentence, the drug <span class="chemical">wertaximab</span> induces <span class="disease">Rombin cystitis</span> because Rombin cystitis is a "complication" of receiving the drug.
      </li>

    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Ten patients with <span class="disease">hyperstosis (HS)</span> treated with <span class="chemical">ramotrigine</span> experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of <span class="disease">myotonic jerks</span>."
      </li>
      <li>
        "De novo appearance" means "new appearance". Although there are two different diseases in the sentence above, the only drug induced disease relationship is "<span class="chemical">ramotrigine</span> induces <span class="disease">myotonic jerks</span>".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Each year, thousands of Americans over 50 develop <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis (TAS)</span>. <span class="disease">TAS</span> is a rare uncontrolled contraction of the fingers that occurs in high-stress individuals. The exact cause is unknown. In the past five years, various drug candidates for <span class="disease">high blood pressure</span> (<span class="chemical">tetraforzine</span>, <span class="chemical">6-inositol</span>, and <span class="chemical">2,2-benzaime</span>) failed to meet FDA safety regulations due to a negative interaction with <span class="disease">TAS</span>."
      </li>

      <li>
        There are 3 drug-induced disease relationships here:
          <ol>
            <li><span class="chemical">tetraforzine</span> incudes <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">6-inositol</span> induces <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">2,2-benzaime</span> induces <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
          </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>



</ol>
