Title: Finding drugs which contribute to disease


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Scientists and doctors need to know whether a drug (such as Aspirin) can potentially cause any diseases before they can give the drug to patients.</p>

<p>In this task, you will be helping scientists identify which drugs contribute to which diseases from a piece of text.</p>



<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    A small number of <span class="chemical">drugs</span> and <span class="disease">diseases</span> have been highlighted in some text. All occurrences of the same <span class="chemical">drug</span> or <span class="disease">disease</span> have been highlighted.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is possible that the drugs contribute to the diseases, and some choices (at most 5) are given. If a drug by itself, or in combination with other drugs, can bring about the disease, then it is considered to "contribute to or play a role in" the disease. Some choices will be empty ("<strong>Do not</strong> choose this choice."), and should not be selected.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read through the provided text and determine <strong>all</strong> of the choices <em>explicitly</em> supported by the text. If none of the choices are explicitly stated by the text, then choose "None of the provided choices are correct." by itself.
  </li>

</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    "<span class="disease">Rombin cystitis</span> is a rare but potentially serious complication of high-dose <span class="chemical">wertaximab</span> therapy administered prior to taking an X-ray."

    <ul>
      <li>
        The only correct choice is: "<span class="chemical">wertaximab</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">Rombin cystitis</span>."
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Ten patients with <span class="disease">hyperstosis (HS)</span> treated with <span class="chemical">ramotrigine</span> experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of <span class="disease">myotonic jerks</span>."
    <ul>
      <li>
        "De novo appearance" means "new appearance". Although there are two different diseases in the sentence above, the only correct answer is: "<span class="chemical">ramotrigine</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">myotonic jerks</span>".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Each year, thousands of Americans over 50 develop <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis (TAS)</span>. <span class="disease">TAS</span> is a rare uncontrolled contraction of the fingers that occurs in high-stress individuals. The exact cause is unknown. In the past five years, various drug candidates for <span class="disease">high blood pressure</span> (<span class="chemical">tetraforzine</span>, <span class="chemical">6-inositol</span>, and <span class="chemical">2,2-benzaime</span>) failed to meet FDA safety regulations due to a negative interaction with <span class="disease">TAS</span>."
    <ul>
      <li>
        The only correct answers are:
          <ol>
            <li><span class="chemical">tetraforzine</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">6-inositol</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">2,2-benzaime</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">tension-associated spasmidosis</span></li>
          </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Data from the recent clinical study indicate that the combination therapy of <span class="chemical">3-toribazine</span> and <span class="chemical">Quertimab</span> causes <span class="disease">nausea</span> and induces <span class="disease">muscle spasms</span> in 35% of patients."
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are only 4 correct answers:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">3-toribazine</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">nausea</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">3-toribazine</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">muscle spasms</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">Quertimab</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">nausea</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">Quertimab</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">muscle spasms</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
