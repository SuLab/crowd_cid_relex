This job is created for BioCreative V task 3b.

This experiment is to determine if the crowd can
read an entire abstract and identify whether chemicals
in the text are stated to cause diseases.

2015-06-18
The Liquid dynamic choice generation was not working
with the test question creator. Since CF is very slow
with their support, I will be changing the way choices
are displayed and handled behind the scenes so that I
can actually gather some data.

Instead of using Liquid, I will do everything by hand
with stable identifiers so that I shouldn't have any
problems with the test questions.

There will always be 5 choices, but I will fill some
in with blanks.
