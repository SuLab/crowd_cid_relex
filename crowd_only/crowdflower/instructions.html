Title: Finding chemicals which contribute to disease


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Scientists and doctors need to know whether a chemical (such as Aspirin) can potentially cause any diseases before they can give the chemical as a drug to patients.</p>

<p>In this task, you will be helping scientists identify which chemicals contribute to which diseases from a passage of text.</p>



<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    A small number of <span class="chemical">chemicals</span> and <span class="disease">diseases</span> have been identified in a passage of text. All occurrences of the same <span class="chemical">chemical</span> and <span class="disease">disease</span> have been highlighted, and replaced with identifiers like <span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span> and <span class="disease">[disease P]</span> to make reading easier.
  </li>

  <li>
    Some possible combinations of chemicals contributing to or causing diseases are given.
    A chemical "contributes to or plays a role in" a disease if and only if the chemical, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, can directly bring about the disease.
    Some choices will be empty ("<strong>Do not</strong> choose this choice."), and should not be selected.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read through the provided text and determine <strong>all</strong> of the choices <em>explicitly</em> supported by the text. If none of the choices are explicitly stated by the text, then choose "None of the provided choices are correct." by itself.
  </li>

  <li>
    Please also rate how difficult you thought it was to read the passage of text.
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    "<span class="disease">[disease R]</span> is a rare but potentially serious complication of high-dose <span class="chemical">[chemical B]</span> therapy administered prior to taking an X-ray."

    <ul>
      <li>
        The only correct choice is: "<span class="chemical">[chemical B]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease R]</span>."
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Ten patients with <span class="disease">[disease P] ([disease P])</span> treated with <span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span> experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of <span class="disease">[disease Q]</span>."
    <ul>
      <li>
        Long chemical or disease names are usually given an acronym, and are included in parentheses immediately after. For example, "chronic pulmonary heart disease (CPHD)". Here <span class="disease">[disease P]</span> followed this format and was therefore highlighted twice.
      </li>

      <li>
        "De novo appearance" means "new appearance". The patients already had <span class="disease">[disease P]</span> before being given <span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span>, and therefore the only correct answer is: "<span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease Q]</span>".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Each year, thousands of Americans over 50 develop <span class="disease">[disease T]</span>. <span class="disease">[disease T]</span> is a rare uncontrolled contraction of the fingers that occurs in high-stress individuals. The exact cause is unknown. In the past five years, various drug candidates for <span class="disease">[disease S]</span> (<span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span>, <span class="chemical">[chemical B]</span>, and <span class="chemical">[chemical C]</span>) failed to meet FDA safety regulations due to a negative interaction with <span class="disease">[disease T]</span>."
    <ul>
      <li>
        The only correct answers are:
          <ol>
            <li><span class="chemical">[chemical A]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease T]</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">[chemical B]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease T]</span></li>
            <li><span class="chemical">[chemical C]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease T]</span></li>
          </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    "Data from the recent clinical study indicate that the combination therapy of <span class="chemical">[chemical C]</span> and <span class="chemical">[chemical E]</span> causes <span class="disease">[disease Q]</span> and induces <span class="disease">[disease R]</span> in 35% of patients."
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are only 4 correct answers:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">[chemical C]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease Q]</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">[chemical C]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease R]</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">[chemical E]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease Q]</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="chemical">[chemical E]</span> contributes to or plays a role in <span class="disease">[disease R]</span>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
