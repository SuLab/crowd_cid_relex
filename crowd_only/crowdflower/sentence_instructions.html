This file contains the instructions for the easy,
sentence-based chemical-disease relationship verification
task for BioCreative V.

All chemical-disease pairs co-occur in the same sentence.
If one abstract contains multiple sentences where the pair
co-occur, then each sentence is shown as a separate task.

Title: Determine whether a sentence says a chemical contributes to a disease

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Doctors need to know whether a chemical (such as Aspirin) causes any side effects before they can give it to people. In this task, you will determine whether a sentence says a chemical contributes to or causes a disease.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    One <span class="chemical">chemical</span> and one <span class="disease">disease</span> have been identified and highlighted in a sentence. A chemical or disease may have multiple names (e.g., <span class="chemical">rapamycin</span> and <span class="chemical">sirolimus</span>). Assume that anything highlighted with the same colour is the same thing. All names will be listed in the answer choice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read the sentence and determine whether it says that the chemical is contributing to or causing the disease (for example, as a side effect). Choose one of the three possible choices:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.
        </div>

        Select this choice when the sentence says that the chemical (by itself or together with other chemicals) directly contributes to or causes the highlighted disease.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span>-induced [other disease] causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.
        </div>

        Select this choice only when the sentence has a format like: "<span class="chemical">[chemical]</span>-induced [other disease] causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>".
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.<br>
        </div>

        Select this choice when the sentence does not say that the chemical contributes to the disease.
      </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <div class="example">
      <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span>, a chemotherapy drug derived from mushrooms and used for treating breast cancer, has multiple side effects, including diarrhea, constipation, and <span class="disease">hair loss</span>.
    </div>

    <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span> is a chemotherapy drug that has multiple side effects, including <span class="disease">hair loss</span>. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">hair loss</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      Some of the patients, especially those over 50 years old, complained of experiencing <span class="disease">chest aches</span> and lower back pain two hours after taking adalamin and <span class="chemical">maximidin</span>.
    </div>

    When a chemical is working together with other chemicals to cause the highlighted disease, the correct answer is that the highlighted chemical contributes to the disease. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">maximidin</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">chest aches</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      <span class="disease">Heart attacks</span> are a well known downstream effect of <span class="chemical">barbatimol</span>-induced artherosclerosis.
    </div>

    The sentence says that <span class="disease">heart attacks</span> were caused by artherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries). Since this sentence follows the "<span class="chemical">[chemical]</span>-induced [other disease] causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>" structure, the correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">barbatimol</span>-induced [other disease] causes <span class="disease">heart attacks</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      The Food and Drug Administration has concluded its review of Pfizer's <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> and deemed it safe and efficacious for lowering <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>.
    </div>
    The sentence says that <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> lowers <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>, which means it is curing the disease. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <span class="chemical">levofloxacin</span> (500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial <span class="disease">sinusitis</span>.
    </div>

    <span class="chemical">Levofloxacin</span> is being evaluated as a treatment for <span class="disease">sinusitis</span>. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">levofloxacin</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">sinusitis</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      During the infusion of aminophylline, the <span class="disease">ventricular fibrillation</span> threshold was reduced by 30 to 40% of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (<span class="chemical">PO2</span>) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits.
    </div>

    In this sentence, <span class="chemical">PO2</span> means "partial pressure of oxygen", which is not a chemical. The highlighting made a mistake. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">PO2</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">ventricular fibrillation</span>.
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
