This file contains the instructions for the easy,
sentence-based chemical-disease relationship verification
task for BioCreative V.

All chemical-disease pairs co-occur in the same sentence.
If one abstract contains multiple sentences where the pair
co-occur, then all sentences are shown as individual tasks.

Title: Determine whether a chemical contributes to a disease

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Doctors need to know whether a chemical (such as Aspirin) can potentially cause any diseases before they can give it to people. In this task, you will determine whether a sentence says a chemical contributes to a disease.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    One <span class="chemical">chemical</span> and one <span class="disease">disease</span> have been identified and highlighted in a sentence. A chemical or disease may have multiple names (e.g., <span class="chemical">rapamycin</span> and <span class="chemical">sirolimus</span>). Assume that anything highlighted with the same colour is the same thing. All names will be listed in the answer choice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read the sentence and determine whether it says that the chemical is contributing to or causing the disease (for example, as a side effect). Choose one of the four possible choices:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.<br>
        </div>

        Select this choice when the sentence says that the chemical (by itself or with other chemicals) directly contributes to or causes the highlighted disease.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span> contributes to another disease, and that other disease causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.<br>
        </div>

        Select this choice when the chemical does not cause the disease directly, but rather the chemical causes another disease, and that other disease causes the highlighted disease.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">[chemical]</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">[disease]</span>.<br>
        </div>

        Select this choice when the sentence does not say that the chemical contributes to the disease.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="ans_choice">
          In this context, &quot;<span class="chemical">[chemical]</span>&quot; and/or &quot;<span class="disease">[disease]</span>&quot; represent or are part of other concepts which are not chemicals or diseases.
        </div>

        Select this choice when there is an error with the text highlighting. If the highlighted text is part of another concept in context, then select this choice. For diseases, the highlighted text does not need to be the most specific (e.g., "cortical <span class="disease">hypoxia</span>" is not a highlighting error).

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <div class="example">
      <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span>, a chemotherapy drug derived from mushrooms and used for treating breast cancer, has multiple side effects, including diarrhea, constipation, and <span class="disease">hair loss</span>.
    </div>

    <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span> is a chemotherapy drug that has multiple side effects, including <span class="disease">hair loss</span>. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">Feverolinus</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">hair loss</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      Some of the patients, especially those over 50 years old, complained of experiencing <span class="disease">chest aches</span> and lower back pain two hours after taking adalamin and <span class="chemical">maximidin</span>.
    </div>

    Some of the patients developed <span class="disease">chest aches</span> after taking two drugs: adalamin and <span class="chemical">maximidin</span>. Since the sentence doesn't say that the <span class="disease">chest aches</span> arose due to the lower back pain, the correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">maximidin</span> directly contributes to or causes <span class="disease">chest aches</span>.
    </div>

    Remember that if a chemical is working in combination with another chemical, then you should choose that it is contributing to the disease!
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      <span class="disease">Heart attacks</span> are a well known downstream effect of <span class="chemical">barbatimol</span>-induced artherosclerosis.
    </div>

    Artherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries) causes <span class="disease">heart attacks</span> by restricting blood flow. Since <span class="chemical">barbatimol</span> is inducing (causing) artherosclerosis, it is not directly contributing to <span class="disease">heart attacks</span>, but is still playing some role. Therefore the correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      <span class="chemical">barbatimol</span> contributes to another disease, and that other disease causes <span class="disease">heart attacks</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      The Food and Drug Administration has concluded its review of Pfizer's <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> and deemed it safe and efficacious for lowering <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>.
    </div>
    The sentence says that <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> lowers <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>, which means it is curing the disease. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      The sentence does not say that <span class="chemical">Lipitor</span> contributes to or causes <span class="disease">high cholesterol</span>.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="example">
      During the infusion of aminophylline, the <span class="disease">ventricular fibrillation</span> threshold was reduced by 30 to 40% of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (<span class="chemical">PO2</span>) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits.
    </div>

    In this sentence, <span class="chemical">PO2</span> means "partial pressure of oxygen", which is not a chemical. The highlighting made a mistake. "<span class="disease">ventricular fibrillation</span>" is properly highlighted. The correct choice is:

    <div class="ans_choice">
      In this context, &quot;<span class="chemical">PO2</span>&quot; and/or &quot;<span class="disease">ventricular fibrillation</span>&quot; represent or are part of other concepts which are not chemicals or diseases.
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
