15925031	4	87	101	norepinephrine	Chemical	MESH:D009638	Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women.
15925031	5	5	14	clonidine	Chemical	MESH:D003000	With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women.
15925031	6	101	110	clonidine	Chemical	MESH:D003000	These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD.

1542489	1	142	151	melatonin	Chemical	MESH:D008550	There is growing evidence that the pineal gland has antineoplastic properties which, however, can only partially be attributed to its hormone melatonin.
1542489	2	47	56	melatonin	Chemical	MESH:D008550	While the in vivo tumor-inhibiting activity of melatonin is established, observations on its in vitro effects have been contradictory.

9278187	0	19	27	dopamine	Chemical	MESH:D004298	Review the role of dopamine D4 receptors in schizophrenia and antipsychotic action.
9278187	1	83	91	dopamine	Chemical	MESH:D004298	For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease.
9278187	2	52	60	dopamine	Chemical	MESH:D004298	Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics.
9278187	3	13	21	dopamine	Chemical	MESH:D004298	However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context.
9278187	4	44	53	clozapine	Chemical	MESH:D003024	This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors.
9278187	5	65	76	ofclozapine	Chemical	-1	Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects.

9278187	7	194	207	catecholamine	Chemical	MESH:D002395	Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors.
9278187	8	225	234	clozapine	Chemical	MESH:D003024	The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment.
9278187	10	125	134	clozapine	Chemical	MESH:D003024	Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response.
9278187	12	76	85	clozapine	Chemical	MESH:D003024	The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia.

21329798	2	181	191	nelfinavir	Chemical	MESH:D019888	Although the presumed drug doses needed for an efficient ER stress reaction and ensuing apoptosis in cancer cells is somewhat higher than those prescribed for HIV-infected persons, nelfinavir represents one of the few clinically applicable ER stress-inducing agents, and is currently being tested in clinical studies on cancer patients.
21329798	3	56	66	nelfinavir	Chemical	MESH:D019888	Therefore, this chapter describes how to obtain and use nelfinavir for in vitro and in vivo studies.

20515944	4	46	56	bortezomib	Chemical	MESH:C400082	The enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib was caspase dependent.
20515944	5	94	104	bortezomib	Chemical	MESH:C400082	Increased processing of caspase-8 often accompanied enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib.
20515944	6	78	88	bortezomib	Chemical	MESH:C400082	However, the increased cell surface expression of death receptors observed on bortezomib treatment did not seem to be crucial for this effect.
20515944	7	15	25	bortezomib	Chemical	MESH:C400082	For some ESCC, bortezomib treatment resulted in a more efficient recruitment of caspase-8 and the Fas-associated death domain to the death-inducing signaling complex.
20515944	9	38	48	bortezomib	Chemical	MESH:C400082	For other ESCC, the crucial effect of bortezomib treatment seemed to be increased signaling via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway on subsequent exposure to TRAIL.

12118861	5	41	51	creatinine	Chemical	MESH:D003404	Kidneys from donors with intra-operative creatinine clearance < or = 55 mL/min (median 50 mL/min) produced acceptable recipient graft function of 48 mL/min at 3 years and 76% 3-year graft survival.

9804172	5	49	56	flavone	Chemical	MESH:C043562	As a mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest, flavone markedly increases the mRNA and protein levels of a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p21/WAF1, and inhibits phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein.
9804172	6	43	50	flavone	Chemical	MESH:C043562	Although A549 cells possess wild-type p53, flavone does not induce the p53 protein, suggesting that p21/WAF1 induction is p53-independent.

14583070	2	58	66	fentanyl	Chemical	MESH:D005283	Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication.
14583070	3	12	20	fentanyl	Chemical	MESH:D005283	Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems.

14583070	13	12	20	fentanyl	Chemical	MESH:D005283	Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications.
14583070	14	135	143	fentanyl	Chemical	MESH:D005283	It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation.
