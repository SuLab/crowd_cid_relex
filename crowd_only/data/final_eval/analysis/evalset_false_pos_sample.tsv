10939760	MESH:D013411	MESH:D015746	5	sentence_task	773933602	0	sulfadiazine	abdominal pain	yes	gold missing relation	gold misses this relation. The same sentence is used as evidence for relation between sulfadiazine and renal calculi
1420650	MESH:D008094	MESH:D020258	4	sentence_task	773932534	0	lithium	neurotoxicity	no	lack context	sentence refers to asterixis, but crowd mistook it for neurotoxicity. However, the very obvious relation between carbamazepine and asterixis is missing from the gold.

25907210	MESH:D010755	MESH:D008175	5	sentence_task	773932250	0	organophosphate	lung cancer	no	crowd mistake	crowd confused organophosphate (a chemical class) for diazinon, a specific chemical

However, the gold relates the drug to poisoning and cardiotoxicity, which also seem very if not more general than myocardial injury
3708328	MESH:D010862	MESH:D013226	5	sentence_task	773932909	0	pilocarpine	status epilepticus	yes	synthetic effect	pilocarpine causes seizures by itself. When pilocarpine at a non-seizure causing dose is injected with isoniazid, then rats experienced status epilepticus. Seems like the gold is missing this relation, or at least is not being consistent

Argument may be that bleeding is a more general version of thrombocytopenia (deficiency of platlets causing bleeding into tissues), but cannot determine this from mesh
19392810	MESH:D008691	MESH:D002544	5	sentence_task	773934409|773934416	0	methadone	ischemic stroke	yes	gold missing relation	gold used stoke instead of ischemic stroke, which is more specific and the type of stroke mentioned in the text itself. Also this paper is missing many more relations (potentially)

24333387	MESH:D008559	MESH:D020258	4	sentence_task	773931854	0	memantine	synaptic neurotoxicity	no	crowd mistake	crowd missed the word attenuated, which means memantine stopped toxicity

24894748	MESH:C041359	MESH:D003221	5	sentence_task	773932132	0	terbinafine	confusion	yes	symptom of other underlying disease	confusion was caused by terbinafine, but the real disease is bradycardia
16112787	MESH:D014640	MESH:D009336	4	sentence_task	773934014	0	vancomycin|vcm	necrosis	yes	ner error	necrosis here refers to cell death
17496739	MESH:D010878	MESH:D003221	4	sentence_task	773934233	0	piperacillin	confusion	yes	ner error	gold has piperacillin/tazobactam as C085143, whereas tmChem picked up the two compounds separately as D010878 and C043265. The relation between the mixture and confusion is in the gold, but ours is wrong because we used the individual chemical instead of the combination
24753331	MESH:C106487	MESH:D064420	5	sentence_task	773932055|773932056	0	s-53482	toxicity	no	crowd mistake	toxicity studies is not the same as toxicity. We missed a lot of relations for this paper due to NER and not enough worker votes.
19338378	MESH:D006493	MESH:D013921	4	sentence_task	773934395|773934400	0	heparin	heparin-induced thrombocytopenia|hit	yes	gold missing relation (not main topic)	NER highlighted heparin induced thrombocytopenia, not thrombocytopenia. This overlapped with the heparin highlighting, leading to work units with only one concept highlighted. This probably confused workers. The relation is missing from the gold because it doesn't seem like this relation is the main topic of the paper.
19681452	MESH:D003042	MESH:D002543	4	sentence_task	773932363|773932371	0	cocaine	cerebral hypoperfusion|haemorrhagic infarction	no	crowd mistake	cerebral hypoperfusion was caused by another disease, which was caused by cocaine

931801	MESH:D000617	MESH:D007674	5	sentence_task	773932482	0	aminoglycoside	renal damage|renal damages	yes	not most specific	the relation is true, but should not be included because the more specific (aminoglycoside causes acute renal failure) exists. This is mesh filterable
2083961	MESH:D012293	MESH:D009325	4	sentence_task	773932609	0	rifampicin	nausea	yes	gold missing relation (not main topic)	text is clear that patient developed nausea and vomiting, but this could happen with any drug, and since it's not specific, I suppose the curators left it out. It is arguably also not the main subject of the paper, so was probably left out
16801510	MESH:D011188	MESH:D008133	4	sentence_task	773934061	0	potassium	qtc prolongation|qt prolongation|long qt syndrome	yes	gold missing relation	potassium is one factor which contributes to long QT intervals (32% of the variability when counted together with the other factors mentioned in the results section)
1837756	MESH:D012701	MESH:D011605	4	sentence_task	773932594	0	serotonin	psychosis	no	ner error	serotonin was highlighted instead of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The crowd is still wrong because serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with paranoid exacerbations, not psychosis
6517710	MESH:D011796	MESH:D013927	5	sentence_task	773933017|773933018|773933019	0	quinacrine hydrochloride	thrombosis|atrial thrombosis	yes	ner error	tmchem highlighted atrial thrombosis as D013927 instead of D003328. The gold actually has the relation between the drug and atrial thrombosis; the relation to D013927 (thrombosis) was left out due to being more general, which is mesh filterable if we had found the more specific D003328
24778426	MESH:D002945	MESH:D007674	4	sentence_task	773932059	0	cisplatin	renal toxicity	no	crowd mistake	crowd saw the title, which is a statement of the effect and not a conclusion. However, this relationship was mesh filterable because we also found the more specific acute kidney injury
11423811	MESH:D003042	MESH:D064420	5	sentence_task	773932341	0	cocaine	cocaine toxicity	yes	ner error	tmchem highlighted cocaine toxicity, which overlapped with the cocaine highlight. Relation is probably true in the general sense but is not the main topic of the abstract.
3987172	MESH:D010665	MESH:D002543	5	sentence_task	773932965	0	ppa|phenylpropanolamine	intracerebral hemorrhage	yes	gold missing relation	relation is explicit but not main point of abstract

The task that the crowd saw was therefore correct, but due to NER error the relation is wrong. Gold should not have this relation
24114426	MESH:D018817	MESH:D008569	5	sentence_task	773931789	0	3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine|mdma|ecstasy	impaired memory	maybe	crowd mistake	text does not explicitly say that impaired memory was caused by ecstasy, but implies it from the text
11425091	MESH:D003042	MESH:D006470	5	sentence_task	773933691	0	cocaine	subependymal hemorrhage	yes	gold missing relation	gold perhaps uses subependymal cysts as a more specific example of subependymal hemorrhage. Gold for this abstract also includes (cocaine causes preterm infants) as a relation, which is totally wrong
15859361	MESH:C012655	MESH:D004342	5	sentence_task	773933978|773933979	0	nimesulide|n	hypersensitivity	no	crowd mistake	hypersensitivity to CE, another drug, not nimesulide

Therefore the relationship is correct, just not the most specific one (can be mesh filtered). Would not have been filtered because TDP was not found at all, and therefore this was already the most specific
10770468	MESH:D008094	MESH:D001919	4	sentence_task	773933592	0	lithium	bradyarrhythmia	yes	gold missing relation	gold is missing relation
19681452	MESH:D000431	MESH:D001145	5	sentence_task	773932375	0	alcohol|ethanol	cardiac arrhythmia	yes	not main focus	alcohol's relationship to cardiac arrhythmia was not the main focus of the abstract, and therefore the relation was likely not included.
8755612	MESH:D004054	MESH:D006470	4	sentence_task	773933320|773933321	0	diethylstilbestrol|des	hemorrhagic	no	lack context	hemorrhagic is a phenotype of the tumor (NER error), and not a disease. The sentence lacks context as well because the first sentence states that estrogen causes hemorrhagic tumors.
6615679	MESH:D006221	MESH:D007022	5	sentence_task	773933036|773933042	0	halothane	hypotension|hypotensive	maybe	synthetic effect	halothane contributed to hypotension, but does not work by itself.
