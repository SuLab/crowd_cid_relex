The potential of compounds to cause <span class=""disease"">TDP</span> was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog. Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause <span class=""disease"">TDP</span> were investigated: <span class=""chemical"">terfenadine</span>, <span class=""chemical"">terodiline</span>, cisapride and E4031. On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man. Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3. These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for <span class=""chemical"">terfenadine</span> (1.9 nM), <span class=""chemical"">terodiline</span> (76 nM), cisapride (11 nM) and E4031 (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects.

In this model of <span class=""disease"">chronic renal failure</span> the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on <span class=""chemical"">lithium</span>-induced <span class=""disease"">chronic renal failure</span> in rats.",1378968,bcv_id_7

Because treatments for <span class=""disease"">heart failure</span> have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of <span class=""disease"">hyperkalemia</span> and <span class=""disease"">renal insufficiency</span> in <span class=""disease"">heart failure</span> patients treated with spironolactone. </p><p>METHODS: We performed a case control study of <span class=""disease"">heart failure</span> patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed <span class=""disease"">hyperkalemia</span> (<span class=""chemical"">K</span>(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or <span class=""disease"">renal insufficiency</span> (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. </p><p>RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to <span class=""disease"">hyperkalemia</span> (n = 33) or <span class=""disease"">renal failure</span> (n = 34). Patients who developed <span class=""disease"">hyperkalemia</span> were older and more likely to have <span class=""disease"">diabetes</span>, had higher baseline serum <span class=""chemical"">potassium</span> levels and lower baseline <span class=""chemical"">potassium</span> supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed <span class=""disease"">renal insufficiency</span> had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with <span class=""chemical"">thiazide</span> diuretics than controls. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced <span class=""disease"">hyperkalemia</span> and <span class=""disease"">renal insufficiency</span> are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously.

The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001).
