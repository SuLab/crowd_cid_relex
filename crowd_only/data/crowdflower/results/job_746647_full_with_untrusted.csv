In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with <span class=""chemical"">D-pen</span> for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant <span class=""chemical"">hyaluronate</span>. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by <span class=""chemical"">D-pen</span>, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by <span class=""chemical"">D-pen</span> treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of <span class=""chemical"">D-pen</span> may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.","<span class=""chemical"">D-penicillamine</span>-induced <span class=""disease"">angiopathy</span> in rats.
