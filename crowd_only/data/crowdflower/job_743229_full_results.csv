When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused <span class=""disease"">proteinuria</span> and systolic <span class=""disease"">hypertension</span> in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of <span class=""disease"">renal failure</span> and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma <span class=""chemical"">creatinine</span> levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced <span class=""disease"">nephropathy</span>, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with <span class=""disease"">proteinuria</span> and arterial systolic <span class=""disease"">hypertension</span>. In this model of <span class=""disease"">chronic renal failure</span> the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli.
