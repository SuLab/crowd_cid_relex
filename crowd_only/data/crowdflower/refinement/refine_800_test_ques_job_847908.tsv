Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, <span class=""disease"">autoimmunity</span>, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of <span class=""chemical"">angiotensin</span>-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed.

Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in <span class=""disease"">proteinuria</span> after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05).

We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. </p><p>METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. </p><p>RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was <span class=""disease"">atrio-ventricular dissociation</span>. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and <span class=""chemical"">dopamine</span> were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively.

The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a <span class=""chemical"">guanosine</span> analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. </p><p>OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. </p><p>DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease.

The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. </p><p>DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered.

Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely.

The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span>. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. </p><p>OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. </p><p>DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus <span class=""disease"">hemorrhagic cystitis</span> after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. </p><p>RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus <span class=""disease"">hemorrhagic cystitis</span> and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. </p><p>DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.</p>"	Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.	12093990	abs	refine_test_ques_all_3748	0	"no_relation

When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring.

After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM. Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments.

When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion.

The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone."

Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP/ DBP <130/<80 mm Hg) at end of study. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography. </p><p>RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn.

The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women.

HT included oestrogens, with or without <span class=""chemical"">progestogens</span>, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. </p><p>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. </p><p>MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of <span class=""disease"">dementia</span>. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. </p><p>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.</p>"	Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.	19370593	abs	refine_test_ques_all_5243	1	"yes_direct

The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound '<span class=""chemical"">carbamylcholin</span>'; that is, <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span>. He bought 25 g of <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span> as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. <span class=""chemical"">Carbachol</span> concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. </p><p>RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and <span class=""disease"">asystole</span> occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span>, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. </p><p>CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment.

All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of <span class=""chemical"">VNB</span>, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. </p><p>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient.

The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound '<span class=""chemical"">carbamylcholin</span>'; that is, <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span>. He bought 25 g of <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span> as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. <span class=""chemical"">Carbachol</span> concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. </p><p>RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. <span class=""disease"">Bradycardia</span>, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l <span class=""chemical"">carbachol</span>, respectively.

Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.

The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous <span class=""chemical"">ribavirin</span> and cidofovir. <span class=""chemical"">Ribavirin</span>, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. <span class=""sentence""><span class=""chemical"">Ribavirin</span> is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of <span class=""disease"">respiratory syncytial virus infection</span>, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C.</span> Intravenous <span class=""chemical"">ribavirin</span> is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous <span class=""chemical"">ribavirin</span> was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. </p><p>RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous <span class=""chemical"">ribavirin</span> therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. </p><p>DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency.

Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). <span class=""sentence""></p><p>RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of <span class=""chemical"">ketamine</span> to manipulation of the fracture or <span class=""disease"">dislocation</span> was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes).</span> The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: <span class=""chemical"">Ketamine</span> reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. <span class=""chemical"">Ketamine</span> should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.</p>"	"<span class=""chemical"">Ketamine</span> sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department."	10901305	sent	refine_test_ques_all_5953	0	"no_relation

The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes. </p><p>METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M dexamethasone for 12 days. Intraocular pressure was monitored daily. After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy. </p><p>RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure. The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive dexamethasone, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period. The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal. In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. The dexamethasone-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle dexamethasone-induced morphologic changes were evident. </p><p>CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes. <span class=""sentence""><span class=""chemical"">Steroid</span> treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and <span class=""disease"">open angle glaucoma</span>.</span> This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and <span class=""disease"">primary open angle glaucoma</span>.</p>"	Dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension in perfusion-cultured human eyes.	7843916	sent	refine_test_ques_all_486	0	"no_relation

In contrast, no <span class=""disease"">artery calcification</span> could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced <span class=""disease"">artery calcification</span> in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth.

Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of <span class=""disease"">artery calcification</span> in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated.

Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of <span class=""chemical"">PAN</span>-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na-K-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with <span class=""chemical"">PAN</span>-induced nephrotic syndrome.

Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane.

The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span>. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. </p><p>OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. </p><p>DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. </p><p>RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. <span class=""sentence"">Use of <span class=""chemical"">cidofovir</span> in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and <span class=""disease"">neutropenia</span>.</span> </p><p>DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.</p>"	Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.	12093990	sent	refine_test_ques_all_3718	1	"yes_direct

The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (<span class=""chemical"">alkylating agents</span>), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped.

The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg <span class=""chemical"">atazanavir</span> daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL.
