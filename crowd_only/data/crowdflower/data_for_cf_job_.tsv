However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.</p>"	The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure-prone and withdrawal seizure-resistant selected mouse lines.	12198388	bcv_id_31

"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span> West European <span class=""disease"">[disease S]</span> Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span>-induced <span class=""disease"">[disease R]</span> (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in <span class=""disease"">[disease S]</span>. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of <span class=""disease"">[disease R]</span>. </p><p>METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of <span class=""disease"">[disease P]</span> (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span> (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span> (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. </p><p>RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span> treatment resulted in a statistically significant <span class=""disease"">[disease R]</span> (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between <span class=""disease"">[disease R]</span> and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a <span class=""disease"">[disease R]</span> of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable <span class=""disease"">[disease Q]</span> or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and <span class=""disease"">[disease Q]</span> alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. </p><p>CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span> after <span class=""disease"">[disease S]</span>. For low-dose <span class=""chemical"">[chemical A]</span>, the results were not conclusive.
