18477409|t|Leukocyte numbers and function in subjects eating n-3 enriched foods: selective depression of natural killer cell levels.
18477409|a|INTRODUCTION: While consumption of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) has been recommended for those at risk of inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, the mechanism of their anti-inflammatory effect remains to be clearly defined, particularly in relation to the dose and type of n-3 LCPUFA. The objective of this study was to determine whether varying the levels of n-3 LCPUFA in erythrocyte membrane lipids, following dietary supplementation, is associated with altered numbers and function of circulating leukocytes conducive to protection against inflammation. METHODS: In a double-blind and placebo-controlled study, 44 healthy subjects aged 23 to 63 years consumed either standard or n-3 LCPUFA-enriched versions of typical processed foods, the latter allowing a target daily consumption of 1 gram n-3 LCPUFA. After six months, peripheral blood leukocyte and subpopulation proportions and numbers were assessed by flow cytometry. Leukocytes were also examined for lymphoproliferation and cytokine production, neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokinesis, bactericidal, adherence and iodination activity. Erythrocytes were analyzed for fatty-acid content. RESULTS: Erythrocyte n-3 LCPUFA levels were higher and absolute leukocyte and lymphocyte numbers were lower in subjects consuming n-3 enriched foods than in controls. There were no changes in the number of neutrophils, monocytes, T cells (CD3+), T-cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+) and B cells (CD19+). However, natural killer (NK) (CD3-CD16+CD56+) cell numbers were lower in n-3 supplemented subjects than in controls and were inversely related to the amount of eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid in erythrocytes. No significant correlations were found with respect to lymphocyte lymphoproliferation and production of IFN-gamma and IL-2, but lymphotoxin production was higher with greater n-3 LCPUFA membrane content. Similarly, neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokinesis, bactericidal activity and adherence did not vary with changes in erythrocyte n-3 LCPUFA levels, but the iodination reaction was reduced with higher n-3 LCPUFA content. CONCLUSION: The data show that regular long-term consumption of n-3 enriched foods leads to lower numbers of NK cells and neutrophil iodination activity but higher lymphotoxin production by lymphocytes. These changes are consistent with decreased inflammatory reaction and tissue damage seen in patients with inflammatory disorders receiving n-3 LCPUFA supplementation.

16819507|t|RNA polymerase II transcription is required for human papillomavirus type 16 E7- and hydroxyurea-induced centriole overduplication.
16819507|a|Aberrant centrosome numbers are detected in virtually all human cancers where they can contribute to chromosomal instability by promoting mitotic spindle abnormalities. Despite their widespread occurrence, the molecular mechanisms that underlie centrosome amplification are only beginning to emerge. Here, we present evidence for a novel regulatory circuit involved in centrosome overduplication that centers on RNA polymerase II (pol II). We found that human papillomavirus type 16 E7 (HPV-16 E7)- and hydroxyurea (HU)-induced centriole overduplication are abrogated by alpha-amanitin, a potent and specific RNA pol II inhibitor. In contrast, normal centriole duplication proceeded undisturbed in alpha-amanitin-treated cells. Centriole overduplication was significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knock down of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional co-activator. We identified cyclin A2 as a key transcriptional target of RNA pol II during HU-induced centriole overduplication. Collectively, our results show that ongoing RNA pol II transcription is required for centriole overduplication whereas it may be dispensable for normal centriole duplication. Given that many chemotherapeutic agents function through inhibition of transcription, our results may help to develop strategies to target centrosome-mediated chromosomal instability for cancer therapy and prevention.

17395497|t|A highly sensitive method for the detection of PKC412 (CGP41251) and its metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography.
17395497|a|INTRODUCTION: PKC412 has proven activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The drug is extensively metabolized, and recently it was shown that its metabolites have differing efficacies against malignant cells. Therefore, we established a new isocratic HPLC method, which sensitively detects PKC412 and five of its metabolites. METHOD: Quantification was performed using N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as an internal standard. We could demonstrate linearity in a range from 10 to 10,000 ng/ml PKC412 with an intra-day variability of less than 7.5% and an inter-day-variability of less than 11%. RESULTS: The assay was used to monitor plasma samples from patients with AML treated within a clinical trial. Here we could demonstrate the ability of the assay to detect five metabolites of PKC412 and describe the application of the assay for drug monitoring in clinical situations. CONCLUSION: The assay described here will enable a discriminative analysis of PKC412 and its metabolites in human plasma samples. First clinical application of the assay suggests different rates of metabolism of the individual metabolites of PKC412 with e.g. accumulation of CGP52421 epimer 2 even after cessation of therapy. Since it is assumed that different metabolites of PKC412 have a very individual mode of actions, determination of PKC412 and its metabolites within clinical studies of the drug will be important.

9988757|t|Molecular mechanism of the regulation of glutathione synthesis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and dexamethasone in human alveolar epithelial cells.
9988757|a|Glutathione (GSH) is an important physiological antioxidant in lung epithelial cells and lung lining fluid. We studied the regulation of GSH synthesis in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml) exposure increased GSH levels, concomitant with a significant increase in gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) activity and the expression of gamma-GCS heavy subunit (gamma-GCS-HS) mRNA at 24 h. Treatment with TNF-alpha also increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of a gamma-GCS-HS 5'-flanking region reporter construct, transfected into alveolar epithelial cells. Mutation of the putative proximal AP-1-binding site (-269 to -263 base pairs), abolished TNF-alpha-mediated activation of the promoter. Gel shift and supershift analysis showed that TNF-alpha increased AP-1 DNA binding which was predominantly formed by dimers of c-Jun. Dexamethasone (3 microM) produced a significant decrease in the levels of GSH, decreased gamma-GCS activity and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression at 24 h. The increase in GSH levels, gamma-GCS-HS mRNA, gamma-GCS-HS promoter activity, and AP-1 DNA binding produced by TNF-alpha were abrogated by co-treating the cells with dexamethasone. Thus these data demonstrate that TNF-alpha and dexamethasone modulate GSH levels and gamma-GCS-HS mRNA expression by their effects on AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer). These data have implications for the oxidant/antioxidant balance in inflammatory lung diseases.

17912226|t|Dyslipidaemia in chronic kidney disease.
17912226|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a highly atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and accumulation of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Diverse mechanisms are responsible: uraemia, dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs and concomitant diseases exert their effect on the activity of key enzymes, transfer proteins and receptors involved in lipid metabolism. Post hoc analyses from large scale randomized controlled trials suggest a benefit of statin therapy with respect to cardiovascular and renal endpoints in patients with early CKD comparable to the effect in people without renal disease. Observational studies found a reduction in the risk of contrast media induced nephropathy and a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for sepsis in patients who had CKD and were treated with statins. In contrast, prospective, randomized, controlled statin trials in patients with diabetes on haemodialysis and in renal transplant recipients have not conclusively shown improvements in hard cardiovascular endpoints. This review will focus on lipid disturbances in renal disease, their impact on cardiovascular disease, existing endpoint studies and current treatment guidelines.

19722526|t|Design and evaluation of novel biphenyl sulfonamide derivatives with potent histamine H(3) receptor inverse agonist activity.
19722526|a|Antagonism of the histamine-H(3) receptor is one tactic being explored to increase wakefulness for the treatment of disorders such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) as well as other sleep or cognitive disorders. Phenethyl-R-2-methylpyrrolidine containing biphenylsulfonamide compounds were shown to be potent and selective antagonists of the H(3) receptor. Several of these compounds demonstrated in vivo activity in a rat model of (R)-alpha-methyl histamine (RAMH) induced dipsogenia, and one compound (4e) provided an increase in wakefulness in rats as measured by polysomnographic methods. However, more detailed analysis of the PK/PD relationship suggested the presence of a common active metabolite which may preclude this series of compounds from further development.

21225024|t|Pancrelipase for pancreatic disorders: An update.
21225024|a|Pancrelipase is a porcine pancreatic extract which contains the digestive enzymes lipases, proteases and amylases. In patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) from conditions such as chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy and cystic fibrosis, pancrelipase can be used as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Pancrelipase can reverse steatorrhea, prevent weight loss, control pain and correct other nutritional deficiencies resulting from exocrine insufficiency. Various forms of pancreatic enzymes were being marketed as over-the-counter medications prior to the recent FDA declaration that all pancreatic enzyme products had to obtain approval as new drugs before marketing. On the basis of evidence from recent randomized controlled trials, three pancrelipase formulations (Creon ®, Zenpep ® and Pancreaze ®) have been approved by the FDA as effective treatments for PEI. Although several tests exist for the detection of PEI, early diagnosis still remains a challenge. Individualization of the timing of treatment initiation and dosage requirements is needed to achieve optimal effectiveness. When used at recommended doses, pancrelipase is a safe medication. Appropriate use of pancrelipase in patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can achieve symptomatic relief, prevent morbidity/mortality and also improve quality of life.

11759109|t|Cell adhesion molecules and hyaluronic acid as markers of inflammation, fibrosis and response to antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients.
11759109|a|OBJECTIVE: Cell adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)) and hyaluronic acid, markers of inflammation and fibrosis were monitored in hepatitis C patients to determine whether changes in plasma levels, during antiviral treatment, can predict long-term response to therapy. METHODS: In 55 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), 33 treated with interferon (IFN) and 22 treated with IFN + ribavirin, sera was collected prior to treatment, at 3 + 6 months of therapy and 6 months post-treatment. Levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hyaluronic acid were correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels, HCV-RNA-polymerase chain reaction status and histological fibrosis scoring. RESULTS: A decrease in ICAM-1 levels at 3 and 6 months of therapy, compared with pretreatment levels, was observed in responders to IFN + ribavirin therapy but this decrease in ICAM-1 levels was not evident following cessation of treatment. Hyaluronic acid levels, in both treatment groups, did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders. Hyaluronic acid levels did correlate, significantly, with degree of fibrosis whereas VCAM-1 levels were marginally increased only in patients with moderate (grade III) fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of VCAM-1 and hyaluronic acid, during antiviral therapy, does not differentiate between responders and non-responders. A decrease in ICAM-1 levels during IFN + ribavirin treatment is associated with response to therapy, and its efficacy in predicting long-term response should be further substantiated.

8907171|t|Suppression of superoxide-generating ability during differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells.
8907171|a|Human peripheral monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 differentiated to dendritic cells (DCs) and with GM-CSF alone to macrophages. Superoxide-generating ability in such DCs was found to be suppressed whereas that in macrophages remained constant. To examine the reason for the suppression in DCs, we evaluated by immunoblotting the levels of essential components of the superoxide generating system in the cells during the differentiation. In contrast to the levels of cytosolic 47- and 65-kDa components and Rac-p21, which remained constant throughout cultivation, those of the large and the small subunits of cytochrome b558 were found to decrease quickly by day 2 during cultivation of monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4. DCs obtained after 7 days of cultivation had lost the large subunit almost completely and most of the small subunit. A cell surface epitope of the cytochrome detected by a monoclonal antibody also decreased during the differentiation. On the other hand, these components, including both subunits of cytochrome b558, were maintained in the cells during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. These results indicate that the decreased levels of cytochrome b558, especially that of the large subunit, is responsible for the low level of superoxide-generating ability of DCs and that the suppression is caused by IL-4.

1918211|t|Use of third-generation cephalosporins. Pseudomonas.
1918211|a|Although the frequency of infection with P. aeruginosa has declined in many centers treating neutropenic patients with cancer, infections still occur and can be accompanied by considerable morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, patterns of infection can change again, and Pseudomonas may reemerge. Thus, in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, adequate bacterial coverage for P. aeruginosa should be part of any empiric regimen. Third-generation cephalosporins are an important part of the therapeutic armamentarium for the empiric management of neutropenic patients. Assuming a low level of resistance at a given center, however, only ceftazidime and cefoperazone possess sufficient antipseudomonal activity to be used for monotherapy. If other third-generation cephalosporins are used, it is imperative that an aminoglycoside or an antipseudomonal penicillin be added. But even when combined with an aminoglycoside, ceftriaxone would not be a good choice for neutropenic patients. It is an important agent in non-neutropenic hosts or in other immunocompromised patients in whom infection with Pseudomonas is unlikely to occur.

8135485|a|Suramin, a polysulphonated naphthylurea, inhibits the activity of several growth factors in in vitro experiments and clinical responses have been reported in human solid tumors. We decided to investigate the relationship between suramin treatment and serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and II (IGF-II) in advanced breast, prostate and lung cancer patients. The serum IGF-I, IGF-II levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. A significant decline of IGF-I and IGF-II serum levels was demonstrated in suramin treated patients. Our results suggest that suramin-induced IGF suppression could be one of the possible mechanisms of suramin action.

11711542|a|The molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for cadmium-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis were investigated using Balb/c-3T3 cells transformed with cadmium chloride. Differential display analysis of gene expression revealed consistent and reproducible overexpression of a transcript in the transformed cells compared with the nontransformed cells. The full-length cDNA corresponding to the differentially expressed transcript was cloned and was identified as mouse translation elongation factor-1 delta subunit (TEF-1 delta; GenBank accession number ). Nucleotide sequence analysis of TEF-1 delta cDNA revealed an open reading frame encoding the predicted protein of 281 amino acids and exhibited significant conservation with the corresponding protein of human, Xenopus laevis, and Artemia. The presence of a leucine zipper motif, characteristic of translation elongation factor-1 delta, was also found in the mouse TEF-1 delta. A 31-kDa protein was detected in eukaryotic cells transfected with an expression vector containing the TEF-1 delta cDNA. Overexpression of the TEF-1 delta protein by transfection was oncogenic in NIH3T3 cells as evidenced by the appearance of transformed foci exhibiting anchorage-independent growth and the potential to grow as tumors in nude mice. Blocking the translation of TEF-1 delta with antisense TEF-1 delta mRNA resulted in a significant reversal of the oncogenic potential of cadmium-transformed Balb/c-3T3 cells as evidenced from suppression in anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis in nude mice. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the cell transformation and tumorigenesis induced by cadmium are due, at least in part, to the overexpression of TEF-1 delta, a novel cadmium-responsive proto-oncogene.

20167205|a|Prevention of global gray matter (GM) volume changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are an objective in clinical trials, but the effect of immunomodulatory medication on regional GM atrophy progression is unclear. MRIs from 86 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) followed up for 24 months were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. An analysis of covariance model (cluster threshold, corrected p<0.05) was used to compare GM volumes between baseline and follow-up while stratified by immunomodulatory medication (IM): Interferone INF-beta-1a (n=34), INF-beta-1b (n=16), glatiramer acetate (GA) (n=15), and no-immunomodulatory treatment (n=21). In the INF-beta-1a/1b group (n=50), significant GM volume reductions were observed during follow-up in fronto-temporal, cingulate and cerebellar cortical brain regions, without significant differences between the INF-beta-1a and INF-beta-1b patients. In the GA group and in unmedicated patients, no significant regional GM volume reductions were observed. In contrast to GA, INF-beta-1a/1b treatment was associated with GM volume reductions in hippocampal/parahippocampal and anterior cingulate cortex. This is the first longitudinal study investigating the effects of IMs on GM in RRMS. Results suggest differences in the dynamics of regional GM volume atrophy in differentially treated or untreated RRMS patients.

16220327|t|Assessment of methylphenidate-induced changes in binding of continuously infused [(11)C]-raclopride in healthy human subjects: correlation with subjective effects.
16220327|a|RATIONALE: The dopaminergic system has been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been shown that information on endogenous dopamine (DA) release can be obtained noninvasively by combining positron emission tomography with a dopaminergic challenge. This approach is based on the assumption that an injected radiolabeled ligand competes with the neurotransmitter for the same receptor. Increases in DA release will therefore result in a decreased binding of the radioligand. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of the DA reuptake blocker methylphenidate (MP) on the binding of the D(2) receptor ligand [(11)C]-raclopride (RAC). METHODS: The effect of a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous dose of MP was studied in six healthy volunteers. RAC was administered as a bolus followed by constant infusion, and subjective effects were assessed using verbal rating scales. RESULTS: Control scans without MP administration showed that the mean RAC binding reached stable values approximately 30 min after start of the infusion. MP administration induced a 24% decrease in RAC binding in the total striatum. Correlations were found between the MP-induced change in euphoria and the percent change in binding potential (DeltaBP) in the dorsal striatum and between baseline anxiety and DeltaBP in the dorsal and middle striatum. We also found a negative correlation between baseline BP in the dorsal striatum and change in euphoria. CONCLUSIONS: Our results comply with previous findings, indicating the feasibility of the bolus infusion design combined with a relatively low MP dose to study dopaminergic (dys)function.

12598076|t|Epinephrine unmasks latent mutation carriers with LQT1 form of congenital long-QT syndrome.
12598076|a|OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that epinephrine infusion may be a provocative test able to unmask nonpenetrant KCNQ1 mutation carriers. BACKGROUND: The LQT1 form of congenital long QT syndrome is associated with high vulnerability to sympathetic stimulation and appears with incomplete penetrance. METHODS: The 12-lead electrocardiographic parameters before and after epinephrine infusion were compared among 19 mutation carriers with a baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) of > or =460 ms (Group I), 15 mutation carriers with a QTc of <460 ms (Group II), 12 nonmutation carriers (Group III), and 15 controls (Group IV). RESULTS: The mean corrected Q-Tend (QTce), Q-Tpeak (QTcp), and Tpeak-end (Tcp-e) intervals among 12-leads before epinephrine were significantly larger in Group I than in the other three groups. Epinephrine (0.1 microg/kg/min) increased significantly the mean QTce, QTcp, Tcp-e, and the dispersion of QTcp in Groups I and II, but not in Groups III and IV. The sensitivity and specificity of QTce measurements to identify mutation carriers were 59% (20/34) and 100% (27/27), respectively, before epinephrine, and the sensitivity was substantially improved to 91% (31/34) without the expense of specificity (100%, 27/27) after epinephrine. The mean QTce, QTcp, and Tcp-e before and after epinephrine were significantly larger in 15 symptomatic than in 19 asymptomatic mutation carriers in Groups I and II, and the prolongation of the mean QTce with epinephrine was significantly larger in symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Epinephrine challenge is a powerful test to establish electrocardiographic diagnosis in silent LQT1 mutation carriers, thus allowing implementation of prophylactic measures aimed at reducing sudden cardiac death.

10726804|t|Lacrimal canalicular stenosis associated with systemic 5-fluorouacil therapy.
10726804|a|PURPOSE: Ocular side effects of systemic 5-fluorouracil therapy include excessive lacrimation which often resolves on cessation of therapy. Permanent stenosis of lacrimal puncta and canaliculi is rare. This report highlights this uncommon complication of 5-fluorouracil therapy. METHODS: Report of two cases and review of literature. RESULTS: Severe stenosis of puncta and canaliculi may be associated with prolonged systemic 5-fluorouracil therapy. CONCLUSION: It is important for both the oncologist and ophthalmologist to be aware of the potential ocular toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. Surgical management to relieve the epiphora is often challenging, and early intervention may be beneficial.

11752079|t|Iodine-labeled tamoxifen uptake in primary human breast carcinoma.
11752079|a|Assessing tumor uptake and retention of (123)I-labeled tamoxifen (TX) could increase our understanding of TX's action and the mechanisms involved in resistance to the drug. METHODS: Nine untreated primary breast carcinoma patients underwent whole-body planar and tomographic (SPECT) imaging 30 min and 4-5 h after injection of 185 MBq (123)I-TX. Tumor-to-normal tissue uptake ratios (T/N) derived from SPECT images were related to estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. RESULTS: In 4 of 9 patients, all of whom were ER+/PR+, (123)I-TX tumor uptake was clearly depicted. In 2 of them, involved axillary lymph nodes were also visualized. T/N consistently increased over time. All ER+/PR- and ER-/PR- tumors as well as 2 ER+/PR+ tumors were (123)I-TX-. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that (123)I-TX is preferentially taken up in alpha-ER+/PR+ breast tumors known to be more likely to respond to endocrine treatment.

21942436|t|Administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) enhances visual-spatial performance in postmenopausal women.
21942436|a|The current article examines the effect of administering dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on visual-spatial performance in postmenopausal women (N = 24, ages 55-80). The concurrent reduction of serum DHEA levels and visual-spatial performance in this population, coupled with the documented effects of DHEA's androgenic metabolites on visual-spatial performance, suggests that DHEA administration may enhance visual-spatial performance. The current experiment used a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design in which 50 mg of oral DHEA was administered daily in the drug condition to explore this hypothesis. Performance on the Mental Rotation, Subject-Ordered Pointing, Fragmented Picture Identification, Perceptual Identification, Same-Different Judgment, and Visual Search tasks and serum levels of DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone, estrone, and cortisol were measured in the DHEA and placebo conditions. In contrast to prior experiments using the current methodology that did not demonstrate effects of DHEA administration on episodic and short-term memory tasks, the current experiment demonstrated large beneficial effects of DHEA administration on Mental Rotation, Subject-Ordered Pointing, Fragmented Picture Identification, Perceptual Identification, and Same-Different Judgment. Moreover, DHEA administration enhanced serum levels of DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone, and estrone, and regression analyses demonstrated that levels of DHEA and its metabolites were positively related to cognitive performance on the visual-spatial tasks in the DHEA condition.

21254307|t|Cognitive dysfunction and cancer: which consequences in terms of disease management?
21254307|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to stress the importance of cognitive dysfunction in cancer survivors, and to discuss the way of assessing and managing these troubles in clinical practice. METHOD: Original studies and reviews reporting the effect of cancer and chemotherapy on cognition and published since January 2000 were selected from the Medline( ®) database using 'cognition' or 'cognitive function' and 'cancer' as subject headings. RESULTS: Main reports concerned women with advanced breast cancer or children with hematological or brain cancers. Overall, chemotherapy was found to be associated with subtle and transient cognitive dysfunctions, which were detectable only with neuropsychological testing and affected most particularly memory, concentration and speed of information processing. Some factors associated with the patient, like depression, may favor cognitive impairment, while the role of others, like age or educational level, remains to be defined. Screening of patients at risk remains limited due to the lack of standardized neuropsychological tests in clinical oncology practice. Few studies have addressed the benefits of interventional strategies but methylphenidate, modafinil and erythropoietin, as well as rehabilitation in children, have shown encouraging results. Formal studies assessing the value of a multidisciplinary approach to detect and manage cognitive impairment must be recommended. CONCLUSION: Cognitive dysfunction induced by cancer or the treatment represents a real challenge in clinical practice. Based on limited published data, few clinical recommendations can be made regarding prevention, evaluation and management of this trouble. Longitudinal studies must be conducted to evaluate its real impact on quality of life.

20415154|t|On tracking the course of cerebral oxygen saturation and pilot performance during gravity-induced loss of consciousness.
20415154|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to track the course of cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) and pilot performance during an episode of gravity-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC). BACKGROUND: GLOC, a major problem facing pilots of high-performance aircraft, is brought about by a sudden reduction in rSO2 as a result of increased +Gz force. It consists of 24 s of complete functional impairment followed by a prolonged period of performance recovery. This study tested the hypothesis that delayed recovery in GLOC is caused by a slow return of rSO2 following removal of the g-force that induced the episode. METHOD: GLOC was induced in U.S. Air Force personnel via a centrifuge with math and tracking tasks emulating flight performance. A near-infrared spectroscopy unit provided the rSO2 measure. RESULTS: Declines in rSO2 from baseline pinpointed when pilots would cease active flight control and when GLOC would set in. Counter to expectation, rSO2 returned to baseline levels shortly after the centrifuge came to a complete stop following GLOC onset. Nevertheless, performance deficits continued for 49.45 s thereafter. CONCLUSION: The prolonged performance recovery time in GLOC cannot be attributed to delays in the return of rSO2. This finding explains why previous ergonomic efforts to shorten the duration of GLOC episodes by increasing the rate of return of rSO2 have not been fruitful. Evidently, another approach is needed. APPLICATION: Such an approach might use the close linkage between loss of rSO2, performance deterioration, and GLOC onset to develop a warning system that would permit pilots to take effective action to avoid GLOC incapacitation.

15302527|t|The good and the bad effects of (-) trans-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta 9-THC) on humans.
15302527|a|This review analyses the therapeutic usefulness of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and its potential to induce adverse reactions on humans. During the last 30 years an enormous amount of research was carried out resulting in the disclosure of the cannabinoid system in Central Nervous System, with its CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, and the agonist anandamide. Under the clinical point of view, Delta(9)-THC produces some therapeutic benefits which are beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, the effects on nausea/emesis due to cancer chemotherapy, as appetite promoter, on some painful conditions and on symptoms of multiple sclerosis are clearly demonstrated. Delta(9)-THC is not devoid of ill effects. On the cognitive domain it impairs the human capacity to discriminate time intervals and space distances, vigilance, memory and the performance for mental work. On the psychic area Delta(9)-THC may induce unpleasant reactions such as disconnected thoughts, panic reactions, disturbing changes in perception, delusions and hallucinatory experiences. However, the long term effects on the psyche and cognition are not known as there are no reports of prolonged use of Delta(9)-THC. Actually, it has been proposed by WHO that Delta(9)-THC should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Drugs, as it does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and its abuse is rare if at all.

8142208|t|The clinical course of hepatitis B virus-associated nephropathy.
8142208|a|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is recognised as an important cause of nephrotic syndrome in endemic areas. This paper retrospectively examines the natural history and treatment of 70 patients with membranous glomerulonephritis and 1 with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis associated with HBV infection. Thirty-seven patients were in complete remission by the end of the study. The average duration of proteinuria in these patients was 30 months. The cumulative probability of remission was 64% at 4 years and 84% at 10 years. Three patients were still nephrotic after more than 90 months of follow-up and 2 others had reached end-stage renal failure. Remission occurred within 6 months of clearing the antigen (HBeAg) in the majority of cases. Steroids alone were given to 10 patients and 2 received steroids and cyclophosphamide, with no beneficial effect. Three patients received interferon-alpha 2b. One cleared the HBeAg from the circulation and had a significant fall in proteinuria, but defaulted from follow-up a month after completing treatment. One had a reduction of proteinuria but remained HBeAg positive. There was no change in the condition of the third. Although the majority of children eventually enter remission, there is a significant morbidity associated with the disease. Steroids and other immunosuppressive therapy are of no benefit. Interferon therapy may be useful, but has not been adequately assessed.

7908546|t|Pharmacological modulation of c-fos mRNA expression in the HL60 and U937 cell lines.
7908546|a|A variety of drugs known to act via increasing intracellular cAMP are used in the treatment of asthma. In this study we asked whether anti-asthma drugs are capable of altering gene activation. We determined whether phosphodiesterase inhibitors, either alone or in combination with adrenoceptor agonists, were able to alter the abundance of mRNA of the cAMP responsive gene c-fos in the cell-lines HL60 and U937. Incubation of cells with phosphodiesterase inhibitors aminophylline, theophylline or pentoxyphylline all resulted in an increase in c-fos mRNA. Further upregulation of c-fos mRNA abundance was observed when the cells were stimulated with the combination of aminophylline and adrenoceptor agonists with beta 2-agonist activity. These increases in c-fos mRNA were accompanied by increases in intracellular concentration of cAMP. These data suggest that in these in vitro models, combinations of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors can increase intracellular cAMP and affect gene activation.

11448725|t|The endocannabinoid nervous system: unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
11448725|a|The active principle in marijuana, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to have wide therapeutic application for a number of important medical conditions, including pain, anxiety, glaucoma, nausea, emesis, muscle spasms, and wasting diseases. Delta(9)-THC binds to and activates two known cannabinoid receptors found in mammalian tissue, CB1 and CB2. The development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics has focused predominantly on the CB1 receptor, based on its predominant and abundant localization in the CNS. Like most of the known cannabinoid agonists, Delta(9)-THC is lipophilic and relatively nonselective for both receptor subtypes. Clinical studies show that nonselective cannabinoid agonists are relatively safe and provide therapeutic efficacy, but that they also induce psychotropic side effects. Recent studies of the biosynthesis, release, transport, and disposition of anandamide are beginning to provide an understanding of the role of lipid transmitters in the CNS. This review attempts to link current understanding of the basic biology of the endocannabinoid nervous system to novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This new knowledge may facilitate the development of cannabinoid receptor-targeted therapeutics with improved safety and efficacy profiles.

21964678|t|Breast implants: the good, the bad and the ugly. Can nanotechnology improve implants?
21964678|a|This advanced review will discuss the history of implants used in breast reconstruction and augmentation, the most frequently performed plastic surgery today. Currently, only silicone rubber-based silica nanocomposite implants are available in the United States. The most prevalent issues involving breast implants include capsular contracture, gel bleed, implant rupture, and infection. In the past, studies have also been reported which linked breast implants to increased incidence of systemic diseases such as autoimmune disease, various forms of cancer, and psychological disease. The goal of this review is to survey the literature from the perspective of material science. It is also largely unnoticed that nanotechnology is involved: the silicone rubber shell is reinforced with nanosilica so implants appear to be homogeneous and crystal clear. We are hoping that this review will contribute to a better understanding of the controversial issues and motivate material scientists and medical doctors to work together to develop alternatives based on new nanotechnology for the women who opt for a device made of synthetic materials.

7544228|t|Effect of procaterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on skin whealing response caused by inflammatory mediators in asthmatic children.
7544228|a|BACKGROUND: Beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists have been shown to reduce allergen-induced skin whealing responses via inhibition of mediator release. OBJECTIVE: To study whether beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists have a direct action against inflammatory mediator-induced skin whealing responses. METHODS: We examined the effect of procaterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on skin whealing responses to histamine, platelet-activating factor (PAF), substance P, or bradykinin in eight asthmatic children in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Two hours after taking procaterol (50 micrograms) or placebo orally, the subjects were given these mediators intradermally at a concentration of 10(-5) M. RESULTS: Procaterol has a small but significant inhibitory effect on wheal formation following the intradermal injection of histamine and PAF by an average of 15% (P < .05) and 18% (P < .05) respectively but not against substance P or bradykinin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists may have an inhibitory effect against plasma exudation from microvasculature in the human skin, bronchodilatory effects are more prominent.

16585600|t|IFN-gamma primes RAW264 macrophages and human monocytes for enhanced oxidant production in response to CpG DNA via metabolic signaling: roles of TLR9 and myeloperoxidase trafficking.
16585600|a|Macrophages and monocytes are activated by CpG DNA motifs to produce NO, which is enhanced dramatically by IFN-gamma. We hypothesize that synergistic cellular responses to IFN-gamma and CpG DNA are due to cross-talk between metabolic signaling pathways of leukocytes. Adherent RAW264.7 macrophages and human monocytes exhibited NAD(P)H autofluorescence oscillation periods of approximately 20 s. IFN-gamma increased the oscillatory amplitude, which was required for CpG DNA-mediated metabolic changes. These alterations in metabolic dynamics required the appropriate combinations of murine/human TLR9 and murine/human-specific CpG DNA. Other factors that also promoted an increase in metabolic oscillatory amplitude could substitute for IFN-gamma. Because recent studies have shown that the metabolic frequency is coupled to the hexose monophosphate shunt, and the amplitude is coupled to the peroxidase cycle, we tested the hypothesis that myeloperoxidase (MPO) participates in IFN-gamma priming for oxidant production. MPO inhibitors blocked cell responses to IFN-gamma and CpG DNA. In the absence of IFN-gamma exposure, the effects of CpG DNA could be duplicated by MPO addition to cell samples. Moreover, monocytes from MPO knockout mice were metabolically unresponsive to IFN-gamma and CpG DNA. NAD(P)H frequency doubling responses due to CpG DNA were blocked by an inhibitor of the hexose monophosphate shunt. Because NAD(P)H participates in electron trafficking to NO and superoxide anions, we tested oxidant production. Although CpG DNA alone had no effect, IFN-gamma plus CpG enhanced NO and reactive oxygen metabolite release compared with IFN-gamma treatment alone. We suggest that amplitude and frequency modulation of cellular metabolic oscillations contribute to intracellular signaling synergy.

18058523|a|Several cyclic and acyclic 6-keto purine nucleotides with difluoromethylenephosphonic acid as phosphate mimic are proved to be potent inhibitors of mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Antiproliferative activity of these analogues on the growth of human blood lymphocytes was tested by MTT assay. Compared to inhibitory effects on the growth of human blood T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors, all analogues significantly slow down proliferation of T-lymphocytes isolated from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease--Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of levocabastine eye drops on early (EPR) and late phase (LPR) inflammatory changes induced by allergen-specific conjunctival challenge (ASCC). We focused our attention on the possible effect of levocabastine on expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on epithelial cells. Such a phenomenon is likely to play an important role in allergic inflammation. METHODS: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, performed in cross-over, outside the pollen season. Ten out-patients suffering from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to parietaria judaica (wall parietary) were enrolled. Patients randomly received levocabastine eye drops (0.5 mg/mL) or placebo eyedrops, one drop in the left eye (right eye as control), 30 min before ASCC. Clinical evaluation (hyperaemia, burning-itching, lacrimation and eyelid swelling) and cytological assessment (number of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, and ICAM-1 expression on conjunctival epithelium) were evaluated at baseline, 30 min and 6 h after ASCC. In parallel, we evaluated the in vitro effect of levocabastine at concentrations ranging from 2 x 10(-9) M to 2 x 10(-5) M on ICAM-1 expression and shedding by a continuously cultured differentiated epithelial cell line (WK). RESULTS: Levocabastine reduced symptom scores during EPR (15 min and 30 min, P < 0.002), inflammatory cell infiltration during EPR (P < 0.002 for neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes) and ICAM-1 expression on epithelium both during EPR (P < 0.002) and LPR (P < 0.02). LPR symptom scores and inflammatory cell infiltration were only slightly modified by levocabastine treatment. In vitro levocabastine at 2 x 10(-5) M concentration was able to down-regulate basal ICAM-1 expression, although it exerted no effect on ICAM-1 release by epithelium. CONCLUSION: Levocabastine exerts anti-allergic activity, in that it reduces in vivo inflammatory cell infiltration due to ASCC, and also adhesion molecule expression on conjunctival epithelium. The latter phenomenon may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect of levocabastine on epithelial cells.

25244623|t|Alirocumab: PCSK9 inhibitor for LDL cholesterol reduction.
25244623|a|The proof of concept that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition affects cholesterol levels was first established after the demonstration that PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations result in a significant drop in circulating LDL cholesterol levels. Subsequent studies revealed that PCSK9 binds the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain-A on the surface LDL Receptor (LDLR) and directs LDLR and PCSK9 for lysosomal degradation. Alirocumab (also known as SAR236553/REGN727) is a monoclonal antibody that binds circulating PCSK9 and blocks its interactions with surface LDLR. Alirocumab clinical trials with different doses on different administration schedules were shown to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol both as a mono-therapy and in combination with statins or ezetimibe. Although there is great potential for anti-PCSK9 therapies in the management of cholesterol metabolism, there is no clear evidence yet that blocking PCSK9 reduces cardiovascular disease outcome. This is being investigated in ongoing Phase III clinical trials with alirocumab.

21203344|t|Therapeutic potential of trichostatin A to control inflammatory and fibrogenic disorders of the ocular surface.
21203344|a|PURPOSE: To examine the effects of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), on the behavior of macrophages and subconjunctival fibroblasts in vitro and on ocular surface inflammation and scarring in vivo using an alkali burn wound healing model. METHODS: Effects of TSA on expression of inflammation-related growth factors or collagen I were examined by real-time RT-PCR or immunoassay in mouse macrophages or human subconjunctival fibroblasts. Effects of TSA on trans forming growth factor b (TGFb)/Smad signaling were evaluated with western blotting and/or immunocytochemistry. Alkali-burn injuries on the eyes of mice were performed with three  µl of 0.5 N NaOH under general and topical anesthesia. TSA (600  µg/Kg daily) or vehicle was administered to animals via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Histology and real-time RT-PCR investigations evaluated the effects of TSA on the healing process of the cornea. RESULTS: TSA inhibited TGFb 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in macrophages, and TGFb1 and collagen I in ocular fibroblasts. It elevated the expression of 5'-TG-3'-interacting factor (TGIF) and Smad7 in fibroblasts and blocked nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad2. Real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry studies showed that systemic administration of TSA suppressed the inflammation and fibrotic response in the stroma and accelerated epithelial healing in the alkali-burned mouse cornea. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic administration of TSA reduces inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the alkali-burned mouse ocular surface in vivo. The mechanisms of action involve attenuation of Smad signal in mesenchymal cells and reduction in the activation and recruitment of macrophages. TSA has the potential to treat corneal scarring in vivo.

11994056|t|Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam administered as a concentrated intranasal spray. A study in healthy volunteers.
11994056|a|AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of midazolam administered as a concentrated intranasal spray, compared with intravenous midazolam, in healthy adult subjects. METHODS: Subjects were administered single doses of 5 mg midazolam intranasally and intravenously in a cross-over design with washout period of 1 week. The total plasma concentrations of midazolam and the metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam after both intranasal and intravenous administration were described with a single pharmacokinetic model. beta-band EEG activity was recorded and related to midazolam plasma concentrations using an exponential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model. RESULTS: Administration of the intranasal spray led to some degree of temporary irritation in all six subjects, who nevertheless found intranasal administration acceptable and not painful. The mean (+/-s.d.) peak plasma concentration of midazolam of 71 (+/-25 ng ml-1) was reached after 14 (+/-5 min). Mean bioavailability following intranasal administration was 0.83+/-0.19. After intravenous and intranasal administration, the pharmacokinetic estimates of midazolam were: mean volume of distribution at steady state 1.11+/-0.25 l kg-1, mean systemic clearance 16.1+/-4.1 ml min-1 kg-1 and harmonic mean initial and terminal half lives 8.4+/-2.4 and 79+/-30 min, respectively. Formation of the 1-hydroxymetabolite after intranasal administration did not exceed that after intravenous administration. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in healthy volunteers a concentrated midazolam nasal spray was easily administered and well tolerated. No serious complications of the mode of administration or the drug itself were reported. Rapid uptake and high bioavailability were demonstrated. The potential of midazolam given via a nasal spray in the acute treatment of status epilepticus and other seizure disruptions should be evaluated.

23190347|t|Axitinib: in advanced, treatment-experienced renal cell carcinoma.
23190347|a|Axitinib is a new inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1-3, with greater inhibition potency than existing VEGF receptor inhibitors sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib. In a pivotal phase III trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma that had progressed despite first-line therapy, axitinib 5   mg twice daily significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) compared with sorafenib 400   mg twice daily. A significant between-group difference favouring axitinib over sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival was maintained in the subgroups of patients who had previously received cytokine or sunitinib therapy. However, median overall survival was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Significantly more axitinib than sorafenib recipients achieved an objective response, and axitinib therapy significantly prolonged time to deterioration (a composite endpoint of death, disease progression and symptom worsening) relative to sorafenib therapy. While its tolerability profile was generally consistent with that of other VEGF receptor inhibitors, axitinib was associated with a numerically lower incidence of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, cutaneous toxicity and anaemia than sorafenib in the phase III trial.

16928604|t|Effects on blood compatibility in vitro by combining a direct P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and heparin coating of stents.
16928604|a|The effect of the direct platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, AR-C69931MX, on activation of blood induced by stents with and without heparin coating was investigated using a whole blood Chandler loop model in vitro. Stents were deployed in Chandler loops. Fresh human blood with heparin and AR-C69931MX was rotated for 1 h at 37 degrees C and used for measurements of platelets, microparticles, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), fibrinogen binding to platelets, P-selectin expression by platelets, CD11b, Prothrombin Fragment F1+2, FXIa-AT, FXIIa-AT, C3a, sC5b-9 and stent score. In the first experiment there were four study groups with unmodified stents: 1a, no AR-C69931MX; 1b, 250 nmol/L; 1c, 750 nmol/L; 1d, 2250 nmol/L of AR-C69931MX. In the second experiment the concentration of AR-C69931MX was 500 nmol/L: 2a; tubings without stent; 2b; tubings with heparin-coated stent; 2c; tubings with unmodified stents. Heparin-coated stents were used in the third experiment: 3a; no AR-C69931MX; 3b; 500 nmol/L of AR-C69931MX. In the first experiment there were significant differences in all parameters analysed except for C3a, and stent score when the group with no AR-C69931MX was compared to all the groups with AR-C69931MX. In the second experiment there were significant differences in platelet count, TAT, FXIa-AT, FXIIa-AT and stent score when unmodified stents were compared to loops with no stents and partly to loops with heparin-coated stents. In the third experiment there was a significant reduction in generation of TAT, stent score and better preservation of platelet number by combining the platelet inhibitor and heparin-coated stents as compared to heparin-coated stents alone. The conclusion is that the direct P2Y12 receptor inhibitor AR-C69931MX reduced the different aspects of activation of blood induced by both unmodified and heparin-coated stents.

8395382|t|Activity of the anti-HIV agent 9-(2-phosphonyl-methoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine against cytomegalovirus in vitro and in vivo.
8395382|a|9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP), a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, was evaluated for its activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in vitro, and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and rat CMV (RCMV) in vivo. PMEDAP strongly inhibited HCMV-induced cytopathicity in human embryonic lung (HEL) cell cultures (EC50 11 microM) and caused a concentration-dependent suppression of viral DNA synthesis (IC50 20 microM) [corrected]. PMEDAP had no effect on the expression of HCMV-specific immediate early antigens (IEA) as measured on day 1 post-infection, but inhibited the expression of HCMV late antigens as measured on day 6 post-infection (EC50 20 microM) [corrected]. The diphosphate derivative of PMEDAP (PMEDAPpp) selectively inhibited HCMV-induced DNA polymerase (IC50 0.1 microM). PMEDAP proved markedly effective in reducing the mortality rate of NMRI mice that had been infected intraperitoneally or intracerebrally with a lethal dose of MCMV. PMEDAP exhibited greater anti-MCMV activity when administered as a single dose immediately after infection than when this dose was divided over repeated administrations. 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-adenine (PMEA) also prevented MCMV-induced mortality, but only at a dose ten-fold higher than that of PMEDAP. PMEDAP also delayed death in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice that had been infected with MCMV. The effect of PMEDAP on RCMV infections in rats was less pronounced.

22518383|t|Shear bond strength of self-etching adhesive systems with different pH values to bleached and/or CPP-ACP-treated enamel.
22518383|a|PURPOSE: To compare shear bond strengths of three different self-etching adhesive systems of different pH values to enamel bleached with carbamide peroxide, treated with casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP), or treated with CPP-ACP subsequent to bleaching with carbamide peroxide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six human third molars were cut into 4 sections and randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 36): group I: no treatment; group II: bleaching; group III: CPP-ACP; group IV: bleaching and CPP-ACP. After surface treatments, the samples of each group were further divided into three subgroups (n = 12) based on the adhesive used. The adhesives Clearfil SE Bond (CSE), AdhesE (ADE), and Adper SE Plus (ADP) were applied, and resin composite cylinders with a diameter of 2 mm and a height of 4 mm were bonded to the enamel. Then the specimens were subjected to shear bond strength testing. Two-way ANOVA and a post-hoc Tukey's test were used for statistical analysis (a = 0.05). RESULTS: There were significant differences between the adhesive systems (p < 0.001) and surface treatments (p < 0.001), but no significant interactions were observed between these variables (p = 0.78). The CSE adhesive system showed the highest bond strength, and the bleaching procedure reduced bond strengths (p = 0.001). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in shear bond strength values between the control and CPP groups. However, the differences between other groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bleaching reduced shear bond strength to enamel, but CPP-ACP application did not affect the bond strength to intact and previously bleached enamel. The bond strength of adhesives with different pH values to enamel was material dependent.

24417903|t|Development of a non-viral gene delivery vector based on the dynein light chain Rp3 and the TAT peptide.
24417903|a|Gene therapy and DNA vaccination trials are limited by the lack of gene delivery vectors that combine efficiency and safety. Hence, the development of modular recombinant proteins able to mimic mechanisms used by viruses for intracellular trafficking and nuclear delivery is an important strategy. We designed a modular protein (named T-Rp3) composed of the recombinant human dynein light chain Rp3 fused to an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal membrane active peptide, TAT. The T-Rp3 protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and interacted with the dynein intermediate chain in vitro. It was also proven to efficiently interact and condense plasmid DNA, forming a stable, small ( ¼100nm) and positively charged (+28.6mV) complex. Transfection of HeLa cells using T-Rp3 revealed that the vector is highly dependent on microtubule polarization, being 400 times more efficient than protamine, and only 13 times less efficient than Lipofectamine 2000 ¢, but with a lower cytotoxicity. Confocal laser scanning microcopy studies revealed perinuclear accumulation of the vector, most likely as a result of transport via microtubules. This study contributes to the development of more efficient and less cytotoxic proteins for non-viral gene delivery.

22650004|t|Cordycepin induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C and melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells.
22650004|a|In this study, the effect of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a major component of Cordyceps militaris, an ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine was investigated for the first time on apoptotsis in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C and melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells. Cordycepin significantly inhibited the proliferation of human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C and human melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells with IC50 values of 120 microM and 80 microM, respectively. Cordycepin treatment at 120 microM and 80 microM, respectively, induced apoptosis in both cells and caused the increase of cell accumulation in a time-dependent manner at the apoptotic sub-G1 phase, as evidenced by the flow cytometry (FCM) and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) analyses. Western blot analysis revealed the induction of active caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage by cordycepin treatment. These results suggest that cordycepin is a potential candidate for cancer therapy of neuroblastoma and melanoma.

12495475|t|Estrogen receptor expression and estrogen receptor-independent cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen on malignant rhabdoid tumor cells in vitro.
12495475|a|Recent studies have shown that the antiestrogen tamoxifen (TAM) can be used in the treatment of malignant neoplasms other than breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) in six malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) cell lines. Alterations in MRT cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogens (4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), TAM, and ICI 182 780) were also investigated. RT-PCR and western blotting showed that ER-alpha was expressed in three of the six MRT cell lines. While 17-beta-estradiol (E2) did not significantly alter MRT cell line proliferation, the hydroxylated tamoxifen metabolite 4-OHT significantly inhibited the growth of all 6 MRT cell lines. However, the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182 780 did not alter the proliferation of any of the MRT cell lines. 4-OHT induced apoptosis in both ER-alpha-negative and ER-alpha-positive MRT cell lines, as assessed by nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation. Neither growth inhibition nor induction of apoptosis due to 4-OHT was blocked by the addition of excess E2. Our data suggested that 4-OHT induced cytotoxic effects against MRT cells, and that these effects were independent of ER expression.

11250127|t|Haemoconcentration, shear-stress increase and carotid artery diameter regulation after furosemide administration in older hypertensives.
11250127|a|The aim of the present study was to determine whether changes of carotid wall shear stress induced by changes in blood viscosity after diuretic administration cause carotid arterial dilatation in elderly hypertensives, as reported in the cat. Arterial wall shear rate (ultrasound technique, profilmeter FRP III), the systo-diastolic diameter (echotracking technique) and the mean blood flow velocity and volume of the common carotid artery, the blood viscosity (rotational viscometer) and the finger arterial blood pressure (Finapress Ohmeda) were measured in 12 young volunteers (aged 25+/-2 years) and in 12 elderly hypertensives (aged 80+/-4 years) treated with short-acting calcium antagonists up to 24h before the study, both at baseline and after intravenous furosemide infusion (0.5mg/min), when the haematocrit had increased by at least two percentage points. After furosemide administration the mean arterial blood pressure decreased and blood viscosity and carotid systolic shear stress increased in both groups. However, common carotid artery diameter increased only in the young controls but not in the elderly hypertensives. These data show that an increase in carotid shear stress caused by haemoconcentration induces carotid vasodilatation only in young healthy subjects, and not in elderly hypertensives. This effect may be related to impaired endothelium function and/or arterial wall mechanics.

15339968|t|Effect on tumor cells of blocking survival response to glucose deprivation.
15339968|a|BACKGROUND: Glucose deprivation, a feature of poorly vascularized solid tumors, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress-signaling pathway, in tumor cells. We recently isolated a novel macrocyclic compound, versipelostatin (VST), that inhibits transcription from the promoter of GRP78, a gene that is activated as part of the UPR. We examined the effect of VST on the UPR induced by glucose deprivation or other stressors and on tumor growth in vivo. METHODS: Human colon cancer HT-29, fibrosarcoma HT1080, and stomach cancer MKN74 cells were cultured in the absence of glucose or in the presence of glucose and a UPR-inducing chemical stressor (the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or the hypoglycemia-mimicking agent 2-deoxyglucose [2DG]). The effect of VST on UPR induction was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis of the UPR target genes GRP78 and GRP94; by immunoblot analysis of the UPR transcriptional activators ATF6, XBP1, and ATF4; and by analyzing reporter gene expression in cells transiently transfected with a GRP78 promoter-reporter gene. Cell sensitivity to VST was examined with a colony formation assay and flow cytometry. In vivo antitumor activity of VST was assessed with an MKN74 xenograft model. RESULTS: VST inhibited expression of UPR target genes in glucose-deprived or 2DG-treated cells but not in cells treated with tunicamycin or A23187. VST also inhibited the production of the UPR transcriptional activators XBP1 and ATF4 during glucose deprivation. The UPR-inhibitory action of VST was seen only in conditions of glucose deprivation and caused selective and massive killing of the glucose-deprived cells. VST alone and in combination with cisplatin statistically significantly (P =.004 and P<.001 for comparisons with untreated control, respectively) inhibited tumor growth of MKN74 xenografts. CONCLUSION: Disruption of the UPR may provide a novel therapeutic approach to targeting glucose-deprived solid tumors.

1740940|t|The effect of fuel source on amino acid metabolism in critically ill patients.
1740940|a|The ideal energy substrate for critically ill patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) remains controversial. While glucose has been proved to have nitrogen sparing properties in postoperative patients, critically ill patients tolerate glucose loads poorly and fat appears to be an obligatory fuel in sepsis. Furthermore, it is not yet certain whether the changes in whole body protein metabolism induced by critical illness are influenced by the nature of the TPN provided. This study was conducted on patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) who fulfilled the criteria of requiring TPN and mechanical ventilation for at least four days. Patients were randomized to receive either glucose (G) or equicaloric proportions of glucose and lipid (GF) as an intravenous energy source. TPN was commenced early, within 24-48 hr of trauma or surgery and admission to the ICU. Nonprotein calorie intake was 125% of calculated basal energy expenditure. Nitrogen balance was calculated from 24-hr urinary urea excretion. Protein synthesis, turnover, and catabolism were measured on Day 4 of the study using an established radiolabeled C14-leucine technique. Degree of sepsis and illness were calculated using published scores. Fifty patients entered the trial but 32 were excluded by Day 4. Of the 18 patients completing an initial four day study, eight went on to complete a second study on the alternative regimen--a total of 26 studies (14 G, 12 GF). Net protein synthesis was achieved in 18 studies (12 G, 6 FG) and positive nitrogen balance by Day 4 in 22 studies. Four patients on the G regimen were withdrawn due to glucose intolerance while none of the patients on GF developed glucose intolerance or hyperlipidaemia. Both whole body protein synthesis and catabolism correlated significantly with degree of sepsis. The type of TPN fuel used, G and GF, did not appear to influence whole body protein dynamics, both regimens achieving greatly improved whole body protein kinetics.

10461936|t|Circadian variation in exhaled nitric oxide in nocturnal asthma.
10461936|a|Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and shows a circadian variation with nocturnal exacerbations. Because exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurement appears to be a noninvasive marker of airway inflammation, we examined the hypothesis that ENO would increase at night. In five nocturnal and five non-nocturnal asthmatics, ENO was measured at 4 P.M., 10 P.M., and 4 A.M. before and after bronchodilator. Both pre- and post-bronchodilator ENO (mean pre- and post-bronchodilator +/- SEM, ppb) unexpectedly fell significantly in nocturnal asthma from 4 P.M. (77.2 +/- 8.2) compared to 10 P.M. (68.4 +/- 8.7, p < 0.003) and 4 A.M. (66.0 +/- 8.5, p < 0.001) with no significant difference between 10 P.M. and 4 A.M.. In contrast, there were no significant differences in mean ENO at 4 P.M., 10 P.M., and 4 A.M. in non-nocturnal asthma. (51.3 +/- 10.8, 57.7 +/- 13.4, 53.8 +/- 12.5 ppb, respectively). Following bronchodilator, ENO rose significantly by 10.5 +/- 1.8 ppb in the nocturnal asthma group alone. The circadian rhythm of ENO differed greatly between nocturnal and non-nocturnal asthma. The significant decrease in ENO in nocturnal asthma may reflect an important chronobiological defect in the endogenous production and/or increased disposition of nitric oxide, which in view of its bronchodilator action, could play a role in nocturnal exacerbations of asthma.

8580630|t|Early protein oxidation in the neonatal lung is related to development of chronic lung disease.
8580630|a|Free radical-mediated oxidation of proteins may impair their function and cause cellular damage. We studied pulmonary protein oxidation and its association with the development of chronic lung disease in 61 newborn infants (mean gestational age 31.1 +/- 4.0, range 24-41 weeks) requiring intensive care with oxygen therapy. Protein oxidation was quantified as protein carbonylation in tracheal aspirates recovered daily during the first week of life. Mean carbonyl concentration was 3.5 +/- 1.6 mumol/mg protein. Negative correlations existed between protein carbonylation during days 2-4 and gestational age (day 2: r = -0.37, p = 0.01; day 3: r = -0.48, p = 0.001; and day 4: r = -0.33, p = 0.03). Patients who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed significantly higher protein carbonylation on days 1-6 (all p < 0.05). In multiple regression analysis explaining bronchopulmonary dysplasia, using gestational age, inspired oxygen on days 1-3 and protein carbonylation on day 3 as independent variables, only protein carbonylation remained significant. We conclude that immaturity is the most important factor explaining free radical-mediated pulmonary protein oxidation in newborn infants and that oxidation of proteins is related to the development of chronic lung disease.

21604834|t|The risky business of dopamine agonists in Parkinson disease and impulse control disorders.
21604834|a|Risk-taking behavior is characterized by pursuit of reward in spite of potential negative consequences. Dopamine neurotransmission along the mesocorticolimbic pathway is a potential modulator of risk behavior. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorder (ICD) can result from dopaminergic medication use, particularly dopamine agonists (DAA). Behaviors associated with ICD include hypersexuality as well as compulsive gambling, shopping, and eating, and these behaviors are potentially linked to alterations to risk processing. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, we assessed the role of agonist therapy on risk-taking behavior in PD patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 19) active ICD symptoms. Patients performed the task both "on" and "off" DAA. DAA increased risk-taking in PD patients with active ICD symptoms, but it did not affect risk behavior of PD controls. DAA dose was also important in explaining risk behavior. Both groups similarly reduced their risk-taking in high compared to low risk conditions and following the occurrence of a negative consequence, suggesting that ICD patients do not necessarily differ in their abilities to process and adjust to some aspects of negative consequences. Our findings suggest dopaminergic augmentation of risk-taking behavior as a potential contributing mechanism for the emergence of ICD in PD patients.

18568907|t|Floating in situ gelling system of acetohydroxamic acid for clearance of H. pylori.
18568907|a|The objective of this study was to develop a novel floating in situ gel system for sustained drug delivery of acetohydroxamic acid (FIGA) for eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The FIGA was prepared by dissolving the different concentration of gellan in deionized water at 80 degrees C. Different concentration of drug and calcium carbonate as floating agents were dispersed with stirring. In vitro results revealed that in situ gelling formulation forms rigid gels instantaneously and floated for longed period time of time in SGF pH 1.2. The formulation parameters, such as concentration of polymer, concentration of calcium carbonate, and concentration of drug, affected the in vitro drug release characteristic significantly. Absence of drug-polymer interaction was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The in vivo H. pylori clearance efficacy of prepared FIGA in reference to acetohydroxamic acid suspension following repeated oral administration to H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils was examined by microbial culture method. FIGA showed a significant anti-H. pylori effect in the in vivo gerbil model. It was noted that the required amount of acetohydroxamic acid for eradication of H. pylori was very less in FIGA than in the corresponding acetohydroxamic acid suspension. From the above results, it was concluded that the floating in situ gelling system has feasibility for forming rigid gels in the stomach and eradicated H. pylori from the gastrointestinal tract more effectively than acetohydroxamic acid suspension because of the prolonged gastrointestinal residence time of the formulation.

16518521|t|Effect of propionylcarnitine on changes in endothelial function and plasma levels of adhesion molecules induced by acute exercise in patients with intermittent claudication.
16518521|a|In patients with intermittent claudication, treadmill exercise may cause acute deterioration of endothelial function and increase in plasma concentrations of adhesion molecules. The authors evaluated the efficacy of intravenously administered propionylcarnitine (PLC)in preventing these phenomena. Thirty-six claudicants with postexercise decrease in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD)were randomized to either placebo or PLC (600 mg as a single bolus followed by 1 mg/kg/min for 60 minutes).In the 18 patients randomized to placebo, FMD markedly decreased with exercise before (from 6.8 +/-0.4% to 4.0 +/-0.4%; p < 0.001) and after treatment (from 6.5 +/-0.4% to 4.4 +/-0.5%; p < 0.001). By contrast, in the PLC group, FMD significantly decreased with exercise before treatment (from 8.0 +/-0.7% to 4.4 +/-0.4%; p < 0.001), but not after active drug administration (from 7.1 +/-0.7% to 6.0 +/-0.6%; p = 0.067). The difference between treatments was not significant (p = 0.099; ANOVA). However, in the PLC group, the authors found that the greater the exercise-induced deterioration in endothelial function before treatment, the greater the capacity of PLC to prevent a postexercise decrease in FMD (r = -0.50, p = 0.034). Accordingly, they analyzed data in the 19 patients with a baseline exercise-induced decrease in FMD >or=45% (ie, the median FMD reduction in the entire group of 36 patients), and found that the exercise-induced FMD decrease was less after PLC than after placebo (p = 0.046, ANOVA). In the same subgroup, the exercise-induced increase in plasma concentrations of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) was significantly higher before than after treatment in patients randomized to PLC (23.4 +/-5% vs 15.3 +/-7%, p = 0.007). In conclusion, in patients with intermittent claudication suffering from a greater endothelial derangement after treadmill, PLC administration provided a protective effect against deterioration of FMD and increase of sVCAM-1 induced by exercise.

16424409|t|The Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial: a comparison of usual pharmacotherapy for asthma or usual pharmacotherapy plus salmeterol.
16424409|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety of salmeterol xinafoate or placebo added to usual asthma care. DESIGN: A 28-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, observational study. SETTING: Study subjects were seen once in the study physician's office for screening and were provided all blinded study medication for the entire study period. Follow-up by telephone was scheduled every 4 weeks. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (> 12 years old) with asthma as judged by the study physician were eligible. Individuals with a history of long-acting beta2-agonist use were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Salmeterol, 42 mug bid via metered-dose inhaler (MDI), and placebo bid via MDI. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Following an interim analysis in 26,355 subjects, the study was terminated due to findings in African Americans and difficulties in enrollment. The occurrence of the primary outcome, respiratory-related deaths, or life-threatening experiences was low and not significantly different for salmeterol vs placebo (50 vs 36; relative risk [RR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 2.14). There was a small, significant increase in respiratory-related deaths (24 vs 11; RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.41) and asthma-related deaths (13 vs 3; RR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.34), and in combined asthma-related deaths or life-threatening experiences (37 vs 22; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.89) in subjects receiving salmeterol vs placebo. The imbalance occurred largely in the African-American subpopulation: respiratory-related deaths or life-threatening experiences (20 vs 5; RR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.54 to 10.90) and combined asthma-related deaths or life-threatening experiences (19 vs 4; RR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.68 to 14.45) in subjects receiving salmeterol vs placebo. CONCLUSIONS: For the primary end point in the total population, there were no significant differences between treatments. There were small, but statistically significant increases in respiratory-related and asthma-related deaths and combined asthma-related deaths or life-threatening experiences in the total population receiving salmeterol. Subgroup analyses suggest the risk may be greater in African Americans compared with Caucasian subjects. Whether this risk is due to factors including but not limited to a physiologic treatment effect, genetic factors, or patient behaviors leading to poor outcomes remains unknown.

10901475|t|The additive intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost 0.005% daily once and pilocarpine 2% t.i.d. in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. a 6-month, randomized, multicenter study. German Latanoprost Study Group.
10901475|a|PURPOSE: To compare the additional intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost 0.005% administered once daily with that of pilocarpine 2% administered three times daily in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% twice daily. METHODS: In a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label study 242 patients with POAG or OH whose IOP was not controlled with timolol 0.5% b.i.d. were enrolled. Eyes had not been treated with pilocarpine and latanoprost for at least 2 years. An analysis of covariance with diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 for study eyes was performed. RESULTS: Four patients on latanoprost 0.005% and 35 on pilocarpine 2% did not complete the study (P<0.001). Two hundred and forty patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. For both treatments the diurnal IOP reduction after 6 months was statistically significant (P<0.001). IOP (mean+/-SD) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to 17.8+/-2.8 (-5.6) mmHg in the latanoprost 0.005% group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to 18.5+/-2.4 (-4.8) mmHg in pilocarpine 2% t.i.d.-treated eyes. The mean difference of -0.8 mmHg (per protocol, PP) and -1.6 mmHg (intend-to-treat, ITT) was statistically significant (P<0.04, PP; P<0.001, ITT) in favor of latanoprost 0.005%. Two eyes treated with latanoprost showed an iris color change. Thirty-six patients in the latanoprost group and 106 in the pilocarpine 2% group reported ocular adverse events (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: From the data we conclude that the additivity of latanoprost 0.005% is at least as effective as pilocarpine 2% t.i.d. in reducing IOP when added to eyes currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% b.i.d. Latanoprost was better tolerated than pilocarpine 2% eye drops in this study. The increase in iris pigmentation requires further investigation.

17182642|t|Pesticides and other agricultural factors associated with self-reported farmer's lung among farm residents in the Agricultural Health Study.
17182642|a|BACKGROUND: Farmer's lung, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is an important contributor to respiratory morbidity among farmers. METHODS: Using the 1993-7 enrolment data from the Agricultural Health Study, we conducted a cross-sectional study of occupational risk factors for farmer's lung among 50,000 farmers and farm spouses in Iowa and North Carolina using hierarchical logistic regression controlling for age, state, and smoking status. Participants provided information on agricultural exposures, demographic characteristics, and medical history via self-administered questionnaires. Approximately 2% of farmers (n = 481) and 0.2% of spouses (n = 51) reported doctor-diagnosed farmer's lung during their lifetime. We assessed farmers and spouses separately due to different information on occupational exposure history. Only pesticide exposures represented lifetime exposure history, all other farm exposures represented current activities at enrolment. RESULTS: Among farmers, handling silage (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.82), high pesticide exposure events (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.21), and ever use of organochlorine (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.74) and carbamate pesticides (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.68) were associated with farmer's lung in mutually-adjusted models. The insecticides DDT, lindane, and aldicarb were positively associated with farmer's lung among farmers. Current animal exposures, while not statistically significant, were positively associated with farmer's lung, particularly for poultry houses (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.58) and dairy cattle (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.89). The occupational data were more limited for spouses; however, we saw similar associations for dairy cattle (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.14) and organochlorine pesticides (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.59). CONCLUSION: While historic farm exposures may contribute to the observed associations with pesticides, these results suggest that organochlorine and carbamate pesticides should be further evaluated as potential risk factors for farmer's lung

12810655|t|The different biological effects of telomestatin and TMPyP4 can be attributed to their selectivity for interaction with intramolecular or intermolecular G-quadruplex structures.
12810655|a|Demonstration of the existence of G-quadruplex structures in telomeres of Stylonychia macronuclei and in the promoter of c-myc in human cells has validated these secondary DNA structures as potential targets for drug design. The next important issue is the selectivity of G-quadruplex-interactive agents for the different types of G-quadruplex structures. In this study, we have taken an important step in associating specific biological effects of these drugs with selective interaction with either intermolecular or intramolecular G-quadruplex structures formed in telomeres. Telomestatin is a natural product isolated from Streptomyces anulatus 3533-SV4 and has been shown to be a very potent telomerase inhibitor through its G-quadruplex interaction. We have demonstrated that telomestatin interacts preferentially with intramolecular versus intermolecular G-quadruplex structures and also has a 70-fold selectivity for intramolecular G-quadruplex structures over duplex DNA. Telomestatin is able to stabilize G-quadruplex structures that are formed from duplex human telomeric DNA as well as from single-stranded DNA. Importantly, telomestatin stabilizes these G-quadruplex structures in the absence of monovalent cations, which is a unique characteristic among G-quadruplex-interactive compounds. At noncytotoxic concentrations, telomestatin suppresses the proliferation of telomerase-positive cells within several weeks. In contrast, TMPyP4, a compound that preferentially facilitates the formation of intermolecular G-quadruplex structures, suppresses the proliferation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)-positive cells as well as telomerase-positive cells. We have also demonstrated that TMPyP4 induces anaphase bridges in sea urchin embryos, whereas telomestatin did not have this effect, leading us to conclude that the selectivity of telomestatin for intramolecular G-quadruplex structures and TMPyP4 for intermolecular G-quadruplex structures is important in mediating different biological effects: stabilization of intramolecular G-quadruplex structures produces telomerase inhibition and accelerated telomere shortening, whereas facilitation of the formation of intermolecular G-quadruplex structures induces the formation of anaphase bridges.

14757441|t|Protein expression of PDZ-binding kinase is up-regulated in hematologic malignancies and strongly down-regulated during terminal differentiation of HL-60 leukemic cells.
14757441|a|PBK/TOPK is a recently identified 322 amino acid serine/threonine kinase that is phosphorylated during mitosis and may include p38 MAPK among its targets. Previous work has shown up-regulated expression of PBK/TOPK mRNA in a variety of tumor cell lines and fetal tissues, suggesting a role for this kinase in malignant cell proliferation. In this paper, PBK/TOPK protein expression was examined in a variety of primary hematologic neoplasms: PBK/TOPK was readily detected in 9 of 12 AML samples (75%), in 3 of 3 ALL samples, and in 1 sample each of a plasmacytoma and blastic type mantle cell lymphoma where it was strongly expressed. In contrast, PBK/TOPK was only weakly expressed in 2 samples of G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells that were enriched in CD34+ progenitors by immunoselection. Furthermore, when HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells were differentiated with phorbol ester (TPA), PBK/TOPK protein expression was strongly down-regulated by 24 h. Under these same conditions, phosphorylated c-Myc was rapidly down-regulated (by 4 h), while the levels of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated p38 were constant. Notably, of 5 clinical samples that strongly expressed PBK/TOPK, 4 also strongly expressed phosphorylated c-Myc, while only 1 of 3 PBK/TOPK negative samples expressed phosphorylated c-Myc. These data show that PBK/TOPK protein is up-regulated in a variety of hematologic malignancies and may be involved in leukemic cell growth. Additional studies are warranted to determine if PBK/TOPK would be a valuable target for novel therapeutics. To this end, we also describe the derivation of clones of 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells, which carry an inducible kinase-defective mutant of PBK/TOPK. This model may be useful for studying the effects of down-regulated PBK/TOPK function.

1968727|t|Nimodipine versus terfenadine in the treatment of physical stimulus-induced urticaria.
1968727|a|Basophil and mastocyte degranulation is calcium-dependent. Calcium-antagonists can inhibit synthesis of and release in vitro some mediators in various types of cells. Both immunologically stimulated and non-immunologically stimulated release of material from basophils isolated from normal and allergic subjects can be antagonized by calcium blockers. The present study was aimed at testing the therapeutic effects and side effects of nimodipine therapy, a new dihydropyridine anti-calcium derivative for physical stimulus-induced urticaria, in comparison with a standard H1-antihistamine therapy. The study was done in 32 outpatients who had physical stimulus-induced urticaria: 20 patients received nimodipine three times a day in a daily dose of 180 mg, 12 patients were treated with terfenadine in a dose of 120 mg. In the majority of patients treated with both nimodipine and terfenadine, satisfactory clinical results were obtained after 3 weeks of therapy. There were, however significant (P less than 0.05) differences in responses. Complete clearance after 3 weeks was noted in 50% patients treated with nimodipine, whereas only 16% of patients on terfenadine were completely clear, and some showed only slight improvement. The treatment was easily manageable, and with few side effects.

17705048|t|Adenosine inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 secretion by the osteoblastic cell line MG-63.
17705048|a|Adenosine is known to inhibit inflammatory responses in many cell systems via a family of purine receptors termed "P1." The P1 family consists of the adenosine receptors (ADORA) of subtypes A(1), A(2a), A(2b), and A(3). In order to assess whether adenosine has anti-inflammatory actions in osteoblastic cells, we investigated its effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin 6 (IL-6) release in an in vitro inflammatory functional response model. We showed that the osteoblastic cell line MG-63 expresses ADORA(1), A(2a), and A(2b) but not A(3). Treatment of MG-63 cells with adenosine and pharmacological ADORA agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine or 2-[4-(2-p-carboxyethyl)phenylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680) inhibits LPS-induced IL-6 release. This inhibition was protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent and mimicked by treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. Treatment of MG-63 with the ADORA(2a)-specific antagonist ZM241385 partially reversed the inhibitory effects of ADORA stimulation on LPS-induced IL-6 release. Overall, these data suggest that ADORA(2a) is involved in the regulation of LPS-induced IL-6 release, thus illustrating a regulatory role for adenosine receptors in the control of inflammation and potentially osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.

19200865|t|Multiple sclerosis beyond EDSS: depression and fatigue.
19200865|a|Depression and fatigue are common symptoms of multiple sclerosis and are the primary determinants of impaired quality of life in this demyelinating neurological disease. The twelve-month prevalence of major depression in patients with multiple sclerosis is around 15%. Untreated depression is associated with suicidal ideation, impaired cognitive function and poor adherence to immunomodulatory treatment. For these reasons, systematic screening and management of depressive symptoms is recommended for all patients with multiple sclerosis. There is some evidence that interferon-beta treatment may exacerbate depressive symptoms and a switch to glatiramer acetate can be envisaged in patients treated with an interferon-beta in whom depressive symptoms become an issue. Fatigue is present in over three-quarters of patients with multiple sclerosis. It is considered the most debilitating symptom of the disease and is a major reason for work absenteeism. There is growing evidence that immunomodulatory treatments, in particular glatiramer acetate, improve fatigue symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis.

14701755|t|Role of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II in U2 snRNA transcription and 3' processing.
14701755|a|U small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and mRNAs are both transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but the snRNAs have unusual TATA-less promoters and are neither spliced nor polyadenylated; instead, 3' processing is directed by a highly conserved 3' end formation signal that requires initiation from an snRNA promoter. Here we show that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II is required for efficient U2 snRNA transcription, as it is for mRNA transcription. However, CTD kinase inhibitors, such as 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), that block mRNA elongation do not affect U2 transcription, although 3' processing of the U2 primary transcript is impaired. We show further that U2 transcription is preferentially inhibited by low doses of UV irradiation or actinomycin D, which induce CTD kinase activity, and that UV inhibition can be rescued by treatment with DRB or H7. We propose that Pol II complexes transcribing snRNAs and mRNAs have distinct CTD phosphorylation patterns. mRNA promoters recruit factors including kinases that hyperphosphorylate the CTD, and the CTD in turn recruits proteins needed for mRNA splicing and polyadenylation. We predict that snRNA promoters recruit factors including a CTD kinase(s) whose snRNA-specific phosphorylation pattern recruits factors required for promoter-coupled 3' end formation.

8898974|t|Chemosensitivity of head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines is not primarily correlated with glutathione level but is modified by glutathione depletion.
8898974|a|Glutathione has a variety of important physiological functions in cellular metabolism and defense, including protection from radicals, oxidative stress, and electrophilic compounds. On the basis of this interaction with both endogenous and synthetic substances, glutathione and the key enzyme for its conjugation, glutathione S-transferase, appear to be critical determinants in tumor cell resistance to several antineoplastic drugs, e.g. platinum analogs. In ten established head and neck cancer cell lines (UM-SCC 10A, 10B, 11B, 14A, 14B, 14C, and 22B, HLac79, 8029NA, and 8029DDP4) chemosensitivity to cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin, as well as cellular glutathione content and activity of glutathione S-transferase were determined. The results revealed no correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cells to any of the drugs tested and the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase. However, the cisplatin-resistant subpopulation 8029DDP4 showed the highest glutathione level and marked cross-resistance to bleomycin. Glutathione depletion with buthionine sulfoximine led to moderately increased sensitivity towards cisplatin and carboplatin in all cell lines, but did not affect their response to 5-fluorouracil or bleomycin. These results suggest that the level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione S-transferase is not a suitable parameter for the assessment of chemosensitivity in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma lines. However, response to platinum analogs is influenced by alterations of the initial intracellular glutathione concentration.

1914456|t|Open prospective multicenter trial with a new monophasic contraceptive combination containing gestodene.
1914456|a|In a large and open prospective multicenter trial of 12,250 cycles from 2,378 women, contraceptive efficacy, clinical tolerance and acceptability of a new monophasic contraceptive combination containing 75 mcg gestodene (delta-5-levonorgestrel) and 30 mcg ethinyl oestradiol were studied. The objective was to assess efficacy, safety, side effects and cycle control of this oral contraceptive on healthy women using no other additional birth control methods. Two women became pregnant (0.016%) during the trial; both were patient failures. There was no effect on systolic or diastolic pressures. An average weight increase of 0.3 kg was noted. Cycle control was excellent with 95% of the cycles free of spotting and 98% free of breakthrough bleeding after six cycles. No serious complications occurred. There was an overall incidence of 14% reported side effects (after six cycles), indicating that the hormonal combination is well tolerated. It should be noted that 41.4% of the patients had some complaint before starting the treatment. For all complaints, a highly significant improvement was seen during the treatment.

20700524|t|Dual beneficial effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on levodopa methylation and hippocampal neurodegeneration: in vitro and in vivo studies.
20700524|a|BACKGROUND: A combination of levodopa (L-DOPA) and carbidopa is the most commonly-used treatment for symptom management in Parkinson's disease. Studies have shown that concomitant use of a COMT inhibitor is highly beneficial in controlling the wearing-off phenomenon by improving L-DOPA bioavailability as well as brain entry. The present study sought to determine whether (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a common tea polyphenol, can serve as a naturally-occurring COMT inhibitor that also possesses neuroprotective actions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the modulating effects of EGCG on L-DOPA methylation as well as on chemically induced oxidative neuronal damage and degeneration. EGCG strongly inhibited human liver COMT-mediated O-methylation of L-DOPA in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, with an average IC50 of 0.36 microM. Oral administration of EGCG moderately lowered the accumulation of 3-O-methyldopa in the plasma and striatum of rats treated with L-DOPA+carbidopa. In addition, EGCG also reduced glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity in cultured HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells through inactivation of the nuclear factor kappaB-signaling pathway. Under in vivo conditions, administration of EGCG exerted a strong protective effect against kainic acid-induced oxidative neuronal death in the hippocampus of rats. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These observations suggest that oral administration of EGCG may have significant beneficial effects in Parkinson's patients treated with L-DOPA and carbidopa by exerting a modest inhibition of L-DOPA methylation plus a strong neuroprotection against oxidative damage and degeneration.

16730375|a|Pain is one of the classical signs of the inflammatory process in which sensitization of the nociceptors is the common denominator. This sensitization causes hyperalgesia or allodynia in humans, phenomena that involve pain perception (emotional component+nociceptive sensation). As this review focuses mainly on animal models, which don't allow discrimination of the emotional component, the terms nociception and hypernociception are used to describe overt behavior induced by mechanical stimulation and increase of nociceptor sensitivity, respectively. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are endogenous small protein mediators released by local or migrating cells whose balance modulates the intensity of inflammatory response. The inflammatory stimuli or tissue injuries stimulate the release of characteristic cytokine cascades, which ultimately trigger the release of final mediators responsible for inflammatory pain. These final mediators, such as prostanoids or sympathetic amines, act directly on the nociceptors to cause hypernociception, which results from the lowering of threshold due to modulation of specific voltage-dependent sodium channels. Furthermore, a direct effect of cytokines on nociceptors is also described. On the other hand, there are also anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4 and IL-13, and IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1ra), which inhibit the production of hypernociceptive cytokines and/or the final hypernociceptive mediators, preventing the installation of or the increase in the hypernociception. This review highlights the importance of the direct and indirect actions of cytokines and chemokines in inflammatory and neuropathic hypernociception, emphasizing the evidence suggesting these molecules are potential targets to develop novel drugs and therapies for the treatment of pain.

19504154|t|Transient encephalopathy from angiographic contrast: a rare complication in neurointerventional procedures.
19504154|a|Neurotoxicity from contrast media used in angiography is a rare complication from these procedures. The infrequency with which it is encountered makes it a diagnostic challenge. We present the case of a 51-year-old male who, 30 min after successful angiography for treatment of a right carotid-ophthalmic fusiform aneurysm with a stent, developed psychomotor agitation, disorientation, and progressive left faciobrachial hemiparesis (4/5). An emergency nonenhanced CT showed marked cortical enhancement and edema in the right cerebral hemisphere. Cortical enhancement is thought to be secondary to contrast extravasation due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Angiography was performed immediately, without any pathologic findings. After this procedure there was an increase in the left faciobrachial hemiparesis (3/5), right gaze deviation, Gerstmann syndrome, and left anosognosia and left homonymous hemianopsia. Endovenous dexamethasone and mannitol were initiated. Twenty-four hours later an MRI showed no signs of acute infarct, just gyriform signal increase in the right cerebral hemisphere on FLAIR and a decrease in the edema observed before. The patient had progressive improvement of his neurological deficit. A control MRI done 5 days later was normal. The patient recovered completely and was discharged. This rare entity should be kept in mind but diagnosed only when all other causes have been ruled out, because more important and frequent causes, such as acute infarct, must be excluded promptly.

12736188|t|Synthesis and anti-inflammatory activity of a chimeric recombinant superoxide dismutase: SOD2/3.
12736188|a|External surfaces of cells are normally protected by extracellular superoxide dismutase, SOD3, which binds to polyanions such as heparan sulfate. We constructed a fusion gene encoding a chimeric SOD consisting of the mature human mitochondrial SOD2 plus the COOH-terminal 26-amino acid heparin-binding "tail" from SOD3. This tail is responsible for the enzyme's affinity for endothelial surfaces. The fusion gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the fully active enzyme SOD2/3 was purified. Although native SOD2 has no affinity for heparin, SOD2/3 binds to a heparin-agarose column. In a rat model of acute lung injury induced by intratracheal instillation of IL-1, SOD2/3, SOD2, and denatured SOD2/3 showed 92%, 13.8%, and 0% reduction of lung leak, respectively. Only SOD2/3 prevented neutrophil accumulation. In the carrageenan-induced foot edema model in the rat, SOD2/3 reduced edema by 62% (P < 0.003) at a dose in which native SOD2 produced no significant effect. Thus SOD2/3 appears to have properties as a therapeutic anti-inflammatory agent that are greatly superior to other available forms of the enzyme.

22112384|t|Use of a multistaged time-dependent inhibition assay to assess the impact of intestinal metabolism on drug-drug interaction potential.
22112384|a|In early discovery, compounds are often eliminated because of their potential to undergo metabolic activation and/or cytochrome P450 time-dependent inactivation (TDI). The blockbuster drug raloxifene is an example of a compound that would have been eliminated in the current paradigm. Despite raloxifene's in vitro bioactivation and TDI of CYP3A4, it is well tolerated in patients with no drug-drug interactions. This discordance is attributed to its presystemic glucuronidation, thereby decreasing the amount of unchanged raloxifene available for CYP3A inactivation. The current study used raloxifene as a model to assess the effect of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation on the kinetic parameters of CYP3A4 inactivation. Therefore, a simple multistaged time-dependent inactivation using UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-enabled and -absent reactions was built to understand the impact of the gut metabolism on inactivation potential. The results of these experiments demonstrated a 2.7-fold change in inactivation efficiency of CYP3A4. Incorporation of these results into a simulated midazolam drug-drug interaction study showed very little change in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the victim drug. In contrast, the absence of glucuronidation resulted in a 4.1-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of midazolam, when in the presence of raloxifene, hence providing an understanding of the impact of intestinal glucuronidation on raloxifene's time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and also providing a validation of a simple in vitro experiment to assess the influence of gut metabolism on time-dependent inhibitors at the discovery phase.

1959542|t|Clinical experience with continuous intravenous sedation using midazolam and fentanyl in the paediatric intensive care unit.
1959542|a|Twenty-four patients in a paediatric intensive care unit mostly undergoing cardiac surgery, received a midazolam dosage between 50-400 micrograms/kg per hour as a continuous intravenous infusion partly in combination with fentanyl [0,5-2,5 micrograms/kg per hour] for analgesia and sedation. The mean duration of midazolam infusion was 11.6 days (range 38 h-40 days). Blood samples for the HPLC assay of serum midazolam concentration were taken and the clearance estimated. The efficiency of sedation in correlation to the midazolam concentration was evaluated by a clinical sedation score. Serum midazolam concentrations between 100-400 micrograms/l were sufficient for sedation. Dosage had to be increased during therapy according to an increased midazolam clearance. The evaluation of the sedation score showed that sedation of artificially ventilated infants and young children can be established by continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam.

10823131|t|Effect of transforming growth factor beta 2 on oestrogen metabolism in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.
10823131|a|Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional regulator of cellular growth and differentiation in many cell types and has a growth inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial cells. The TGF-beta 2 isoform has been shown to be present in high concentrations in breast cyst fluid and might have a protective role in breast cancer. In addition, oestrogens play an important role in breast cancer development, and oestrone sulphate (E1S) might be the main source of active oestrogens in the breast. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of TGF-beta 2 on oestrogen synthesis in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TGF-beta 2 may exert a protective effect in breast cancer. In this study, higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 significantly inhibited the conversion of E1S to oestrone (E1) and the conversion of E1 to the potent oestrogen, oestradiol (E2). TGF-beta 2 did not have any effect on MCF-7 cell growth or on E2 to E1 conversion. In conclusion, TGF-beta 2 might exert a protective role in breast cancer by reducing the amount of active oestrogens present in the breast.

12925111|t|Telithromycin 800 mg once daily for seven to ten days is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for community-acquired pneumonia.
12925111|a|OBJECTIVE: This open, multinational study examined the efficacy and tolerability of telithromycin (HMR 3647), the first ketolide antibacterial agent, at an oral dose of 800 mg once daily for seven to ten days (further validated using pharmacokinetic analysis) as an empiric therapy in adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: A total of 240 patients (aged 18-79 years; median 40 years) with clinical signs and symptoms of CAP (radiologically confirmed) were enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of study medication. Sputum and blood samples for bacteriologic documentation were collected within 48 h prior to enrollment. Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were assessed 17-21 days (test of cure visit) and 31-36 days (late post-therapy visit) after treatment initiation. Adverse events were assessed by spontaneous reporting and investigator observation. RESULTS: At the test of cure visit, 92.9% (95% CI: 88.4-96.1; n= 197) of patients achieved clinical cure in the per-protocol (PP) population. In the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, the cure rate was 79.6% (95% CI: 73.9-84.5; n= 240), including 12.5% of undetermined cases categorized as failures. Clinical cure (PP population) remained high in patients >/=65 years (85.7%), and in patients with a Fine score >/=III (92.1%). Among those patients for whom bacteriologic data were available, the majority had a satisfactory outcome (88.9% in the bacteriologic PP; n= 45). Bacterial eradication rates were similarly high (85.5% and 82.7% for the mITT and PP populations, respectively). All patients with infections as a result of atypical/intracellular pathogens Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila had a clinical outcome of cure. Treatment was well tolerated. Adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal in origin and mild in intensity. CONCLUSION: An oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg once daily for seven to ten days is an effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment for mild to moderate CAP in adults.

15925031|t|Histories of sexual abuse are associated with differential effects of clonidine on autonomic function in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
15925031|a|In women meeting strict criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), we examined whether clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist, would have different effects on sexually abused versus non-abused PMDD women for measures of autonomic nervous system function. Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo. During the luteal phase that preceded randomization and following each two-month challenge, women were tested for cardiovascular measures at rest and in response to mental stress, and for resting plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations as well as beta1 and beta2-AR responsivity using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women. With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women. These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD.

15803482|t|Isolated vitamin E deficiency with demyelinating neuropathy.
15803482|a|A 22-year-old man, with a past history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures treated with phenobarbital, presented with spinocerebellar ataxia. The electrophysiological studies revealed a demyelinating motor-sensory neuropathy. The serum vitamin E level was low. Sural nerve biopsy revealed loss of large myelinated fibers with evidence of remyelination. Vitamin E supplementation led to clinical and electrophysiological recovery of sensory conduction and evoked potentials. Motor nerve conduction, however, showed only partial recovery. Vitamin E deficiency leading to a demyelinating neuropathy, as in the present case, suggests that the full spectrum of the disease entity is not fully defined.

19277602|t|Pioglitazone does not enhance the effectiveness of lifestyle modification in preventing conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes in Asian Indians: results of the Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme-2 (IDPP-2).
19277602|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this prevention programme was to study whether combining pioglitazone with lifestyle modification would enhance the efficacy of lifestyle modification in preventing type 2 diabetes in Asian Indians with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: In a community-based, placebo-controlled 3 year prospective study, 407 participants with impaired glucose tolerance (mean age 45.3 +/- 6.2 years, mean BMI 25.9 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2)) were sequentially grouped to receive either: lifestyle modification plus pioglitazone, 30 mg (n = 204) or lifestyle modification plus placebo (n = 203). The participants and investigators were blinded to the assignment. The primary outcome was development of diabetes. RESULTS: At baseline, both groups had similar demographic, anthropometric and biochemical characteristics. At year 3, the response rate was 90.2%. The cumulative incidence of diabetes was 29.8% with pioglitazone and 31.6% with placebo (unadjusted HR 1.084 [95% CI 0.753-1.560], p = 0.665). Normoglycaemia was achieved in 40.9% and 32.3% of participants receiving pioglitazone and placebo, respectively (p = 0.109). In pioglitazone group, two deaths and two non-fatal hospitalisations occurred due to cardiac problems; in the placebo group there were two occurrences of cardiac disease. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite good adherence to lifestyle modification and drug therapy, no additional effect of pioglitazone was seen above that achieved with placebo. The effectiveness of the intervention in both groups was comparable with that of lifestyle modification alone, as reported from the Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme-1. The results are at variance with studies that showed significant relative risk reduction in conversion to diabetes with pioglitazone in Americans with IGT. An ethnicity-related difference in the action of pioglitazone in non-diabetic participants may be one explanation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00276497 FUNDING: This study was funded by the India Diabetes Research Foundation.

17127704|t|Predicting response to peginterferon alpha-2a, lamivudine and the two combined for HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.
17127704|a|OBJECTIVE: In a trial of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B, 24 week post-treatment biochemical and virological response rates with peginterferon alpha-2a with or without lamivudine were significantly higher than with lamivudine alone. The effect of pre-treatment factors on post-treatment responses was investigated. METHODS: Multivariate analyses were performed using available data from 518 patients treated with peginterferon alpha-2a with or without lamivudine, or with lamivudine alone. A post-treatment response was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalisation and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of <20,000 copies/ml. RESULTS: In logistic regression analyses across all treatment arms, peginterferon alpha-2a (with or without lamivudine) therapy, younger age, female gender, high baseline ALT, low baseline HBV DNA and HBV genotype were identified as significant predictors of combined response at 24 weeks post-treatment. In the peginterferon alpha-2a and lamivudine monotherapy arms, patients with genotypes B or C had a higher chance of response than genotype D infected patients (p<0.001), the latter responding better to the combination than to peginterferon alpha-2a monotherapy (p = 0.015). At 1 year post-treatment, response rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 19.2% for the peginterferon alpha-2a, 19.0% for the combination, and 10.0% for the lamivudine groups, with genotypes B or C associated with a sustained combined response to peginterferon alpha-2a with or without lamivudine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline ALT and HBV DNA levels, patient age, gender, and infecting HBV genotype significantly influenced combined response at 24 weeks post-treatment, in patients treated with peginterferon alpha-2a and/or lamivudine. At 1 year post-treatment HBV genotype was significantly predictive of efficacy for patients treated with peginterferon alpha-2a with or without lamivudine.

24296324|t|Comparison of the effects of amlodipine and losartan on blood pressure and diurnal variation in hypertensive stroke patients: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative parallel study.
24296324|a|BACKGROUND: Lowering blood pressure (BP) and reducing diurnal variation are important for the prevention of stroke in patients with hypertension. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to compare the BP-lowering and diurnal BP variation effects of amlodipine and losartan on acute stroke patients. METHODS: Seventy-seven hypertensive patients with acute stroke were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, single-center clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to receive either amlodipine or losartan daily. To evaluate whether amlodipine was noninferior to losartan, ambulatory BP monitoring was performed before the drugs were first administered and at the end of week 8. BP variables analyzed included the mean awake, sleep, morning, evening, and prewake BP values; the nocturnal dipping status; and the morning surge. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients in the amlodipine group and 38 patients in the losartan group completed the follow-up. In the baseline characteristics, mean age was 63.6 years, and 68.8% were male. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean (SD) systolic BP decreased 14.82 (11.71) mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 13.11 (12.69) mm Hg in the losartan group, and amlodipine proved noninferior to losartan (mean difference, 1.71 mm Hg [95% CI, -3.83 to 7.26]). However, in the per-protocol analysis, noninferiority was not proven (BP reduction, 16.06 [11.33] vs 17.17 [11.85] mm Hg; mean difference, -1.11 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.88 to 4.65]). Amlodipine had a greater tendency than losartan to produce a blunt morning surge. CONCLUSIONS: The noninferiority of amlodipine was not confirmed by the per-protocol analysis. However, amlodipine showed a favorable effect on the morning surge. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01830517.

17200780|t|Immunization of LDL receptor-deficient mice with beta2-glycoprotein 1 or human serum albumin induces a more inflammatory phenotype in atherosclerotic plaques.
17200780|a|Antiphospholipid antibodies are a risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis and may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.The aim of this study was to investigate whether antibodies to human beta2-glycoprotein 1 (beta2GP1), as a model of antiphospholipid antibodies, modify the phenotype of atherosclerotic lesions. LDL receptor-deficient mice were immunized with human beta2GP1, human serum albumin (HSA), or not immunized, and fed a high-cholesterol diet for 14 weeks. Some mice also received pravastatin. Immunization with human beta2GP1 or HSA resulted in formation of autoantibodies recognizing murine beta2GP1 or murine albumin, respectively. We quantified atherosclerotic lesion development and mRNA levels of inflammation associated proteins in the thoraco-abdominal aorta as well as lesion development,cellular composition and collagen content in the aortic roots. Immunization with beta2GP1 or HSA had no effect on lesion size,but modified the expression in plaque areas of several inflammation-associated proteins. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue factor, interferon-gamma and CD25 was highest in the thoraco-abdominal aorta of beta2GP1-immunized mice, lowest in non-immunized mice and intermediate in HSA-immunized animals. Immunization with beta2GP1, but not HSA, resulted in a lower smooth muscle cell and collagen content of lesions in aortic roots. Statin treatment partially reversed the effects of beta2GP1 immunization. We conclude that immunization with beta2GP1, and to a lesser extent with HSA, leads to modifications in the cellular and protein composition of atherosclerotic plaques, which are associated with a more inflammatory phenotype. Statin treatment partially prevents these changes.

10029090|t|Vitamin E succinate (VES) induces Fas sensitivity in human breast cancer cells: role for Mr 43,000 Fas in VES-triggered apoptosis.
10029090|a|Fas (CD95/APO-1) is an important mediator of apoptosis. We show that Fas-resistant MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells become responsive to anti-Fas (CD95) agonistic antibody-triggered apoptosis after pretreatment or cotreatment with vitamin E succinate (VES; RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate). In contrast, no enhancement of anti-Fas agonistic antibody-triggered apoptosis was observed following VES pretreatment or cotreatment with Fas-sensitive primary cultures of human mammary epithelial cells, immortalized MCF-10A cells, or T47D human breast cancer cells. Although VES is itself a potent apoptotic triggering agent, the 6-h pretreatment procedure for Fas sensitization did not initiate VES-mediated apoptosis. The combination of VES plus anti-Fas in pretreatment protocols was synergistic, inducing 2.8-, 3.0-, and 6.3-fold enhanced apoptosis in Fas-resistant MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. Likewise, cotreatment of Fas-resistant MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells with VES plus anti-Fas enhanced apoptosis 1.9-, 2.0-, and 2.6-fold, respectively. Functional knockout of Fas-mediated signaling with either Fas-neutralizing antibody (MCF-7-, MDA-MB-231-, and MDA-MB-435-treated cells) or Fas antisense oligomers (MDA-MB-435-treated cells only), reduced VES-triggered apoptosis by approximately 50%. Analyses of whole cell extracts from Fas-sensitive cells revealed high constitutive expression of Mr 43,000 Fas, whereas Fas-resistant cells expressed low levels that were confined to the cytosolic fraction. VES treatment of the Fas-resistant cells caused a depletion of cytosolic Mr 43,000 Fas with a concomitant increase in Mr 43,000 membrane Fas. These data show that VES can convert Fas-resistant human breast cancer cells to a Fas-sensitive phenotype, perhaps by translocation of cytosolic Mr 43,000 Fas to the membrane and show that VES-mediated apoptosis involves Mr 43,000 Fas signaling.

17502473|t|Vasculitic neuropathy in a patient with hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency.
17502473|a|OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, pathological, and mutational features of hereditary C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency as a cause of isolated vasculitic neuropathy. PATIENT: A 35-year-old woman with sensorimotor mononeuritis multiplex and facial palsy. RESULTS: The sural nerve biopsy results showed a decrease of myelinated fibers with axonal degeneration and severe hypersensitivity vasculitis, with deposition of C1q on vessel walls. Mutational analysis of the C1INH gene found a new mutation, a heterozygous 2-base pair deletion in exon 8. The patient was treated with plasmapheresis and intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone, which resulted in marked improvement. CONCLUSION: Hereditary C1INH deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis of nonsystemic vasculitis neuropathy.

14750216|t|Molecular mechanisms for apigenin-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of hormone refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells.
14750216|a|Development of effective agents for treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer has become a national medical priority. We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of apigenin on androgen-refractory human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells that have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and pRb. Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2, and E and their activating partner, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2, 4, and 6, with concomitant upregulation of WAF1/p21, KIP1/p27, INK4a/p16, and INK4c/p18. The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol. Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition.

9807607|a|Suxamethonium in the doses of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/kg was compared with mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg in 80 patients requiring nasotracheal intubation for maxillofacial surgery in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg/kg and alfentanil 15 micrograms/kg. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the four relaxant groups. Anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane in 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen and analgesia provided with intravenous pethidine 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg and rectal indomethacin 100mg. All patients given mivacurium or suxamethonium 1 mg/kg had acceptable intubating conditions. Significantly fewer patients given suxamethonium 0.5 mg or 0.25 mg/kg had acceptable intubating conditions (90% and 70% respectively) (P = 0.003). Poor intubating conditions requiring additional relaxation were seen in two patients given suxamethonium 0.25 mg/kg and two given 0.5 mg/kg, while no patients given suxamethonium 1.0 mg/kg or mivacurium 0.15 mg/kg required additional relaxation (P = 0.004). Only four patients had postoperative myalgia, all of whom were given suxamethonium 0.5 mg/kg or more but no significant difference between groups could be demonstrated.

9164662|t|Serum boron concentration from inhabitants of an urban area in Japan. Reference value and interval for the health screening of boron exposure.
9164662|a|Boron (B) levels were determined in the serum of 980 healthy inhabitants living in an urban area of Japan by means of inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICPES). The results showed a log-normal distribution of serum B for both sexes, although there are age-related differences. In male subjects, serum B increases rapidly up to 49 yr of age, reaching a plateau between ages 50 and 69 yr old, followed by a gradual increase up to 70 yr or older. Female subjects exhibit a gradual increase up to the age of 70 yr old. The reference value for male and female subjects was 79.8 micrograms/L and 67.9 micrograms/L, and the reference interval was 33.3-191.2 micrograms/L and 29.5-154.9 micrograms/L, respectively. The obtained reference value and interval of the nonexposed group may be useful for health screening for B exposure, either for people living in regions with high levels of B in the environment, or for workers who are exposed to this element.

23783141|t|Activation of ERK1/2 and Akt is associated with cisplatin resistance in human lung cancer cells.
23783141|a|Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of solid tumours including small cell lung cancers, but its success is often compromised by relapse and resistance to further treatment. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt are two major cell survival pathways that are upregulated and activated in lung cancer tissues. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and Akt (p-Akt) can be further stimulated by chemotherapeutics in cancer cells. Although individually targeting the ERK1/2 or Akt pathway has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to therapy, the effect of concurrently blocking these two pathways on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin has not been investigated. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways contribute to cisplatin resistance in human small cell lung cancer A549 cells. The results showed that cisplatin activates p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt in A549 cells. Blockade of either of these pathways with chemical inhibitors moderately sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Strikingly, concurrent inhibition of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt significantly potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The sensitization of A549 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity induced by p-Akt inhibition was mediated by the upregulation of PUMA, whereas that induced by p-ERK1/2 inhibition occurred by Bcl-2 downregulation. These data indicate that the cooperative effects of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt on attenuating cisplatin cytotoxicity are mediated by PUMA and Bcl-2 regulation, and concurrently blocking these pathways may be an effective strategy for improving the efficacy of cisplatin as anticancer treatment.

10796575|t|Inhaled steroids for bronchiectasis.
10796575|a|BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a progressive condition characterised by irreversible destruction and dilatation of airways, generally associated with chronic bacterial infection. The two distinct therapeutic goals are: symptom control and reduction in morbidity; and prevention of progression of the underlying disease. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether regular inhaled corticosteroids produce improvement in symptom control and whether they beneficially influence the natural history of the disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Airways Group RCT register and Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register were searched using the following search terms; bronchiectasis AND [corticosteroid* OR beclomethasone OR budesonide OR fluticasone OR triamcinolone OR flunisolide]. Bibliographies of each included RCT was searched for additional trials. Pharmaceutical companies that manufacture inhaled corticosteroids were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised double blind studies controlled trials were included. Patients with radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis were included, but patients with cystic fibrosis were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted by one of the reviewers (FR). Continuous outcomes were analysed as effect sizes (weighted mean difference or as standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals). MAIN RESULTS: Only two trials on a total of 54 patients could be included. The studies were of 4 and 6 weeks duration. Inhaled corticosteroids had no significant effect on any of the outcomes included in this review, however there was a trend towards improving: FEV1, FVC, PEFR, RV and DLco. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In bronchiectasis, regular use of inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function. The available studies were too short and too small to provide any clear evidence to guide practice. Larger and longer studies should include rate of decline of lung function, exacerbation frequency, hospitalisations and healthy status as outcomes.

23539745|t|Alternative mutational pathways to intermediate resistance to vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
23539745|a|BACKGROUND:    We used 2 in vitro experimental systems to compare phenotypic and genotypic changes that accompany selection of mutants of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain JH1 with low-level vancomycin resistance similar to the type found in vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). METHODS:    The previously described MRSA strain JH1 and its vancomycin-intermediate mutant derivative JH2, both of which were recovered from a patient undergoing vancomycin chemotherapy, were used in this study. Mutants of JH1 were selected in vitro by means of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs) and by exposure to vancomycin in laboratory growth medium. Phenotypic abnormalities of JH1 mutants generated by each in vitro experimental system were compared to those of JH2, and whole genomes of 2 in vitro JH1 mutants were sequenced to identify mutations that may be associated with an increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS:    JH1R1 was selected from the PK/PD model, and JH1R2 was selected in laboratory growth medium. Both mutants displayed reduced vancomycin and daptomycin susceptibility and phenotypic alterations (eg, thicker cell walls and abnormal autolysis) that are typical of in vivo VISA mutants. Genome sequencing of JH1R1 identified point mutations in 4 genes, all of which were different from the mutations described in JH2, including 1 mutation in yycG, a component of the WalKR sensory regulatory system. Sequencing of the JH1R2 genome identified mutations in 7 genes, including 2 in rpoB. CONCLUSION:    Our findings indicate that JH1 is able to develop VISA-type resistance through several alternative genetic pathways.

9867898|t|Methylene blue by intraosseous infusion for methemoglobinemia.
9867898|a|Intraosseous administration of methylene blue may be an emergency alternative to intravascular administration. A 6-week-old female infant (3 kg) presented to the emergency department after a 1-week illness and appeared cyanotic and listless. Oxygen saturation by oximetry was 86% while the patient was receiving oxygen. Vital signs were blood pressure, 107/80 mm Hg; pulse, 190; respirations, 47; temperature, 39.0 degreesC. A metabolic acidosis and a methemoglobin level of 29.3% were present. After several unsuccessful attempts to establish intravenous access, an intraosseous needle was placed in the infant's left tibia. Methylene blue, 1 mg/kg, normal saline solution, and sodium bicarbonate were given intraosseously. The patient's oxygen saturation rose to 98% to 100%, and her cyanosis improved. Three hours later, her methemoglobin level was 8.2%. The child recovered uneventfully and was sent home after 3 days. Intraosseous administration of standard intravenous doses of methylene blue rapidly terminated the effects of acquired methemoglobinemia.

21601843|a|INTRODUCTION: We present data on the association of manganese (Mn) level with hypertension in a representative sample of the adult Korean population who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008. METHODS: This study was based on the data obtained by KNHANES 2008, which was conducted for three years (2007-2009) using a rolling sampling design involving a complex, stratified, multistage, probability-cluster survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of South Korea. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis after controlling for covariates, including gender, age, regional area, education level, smoking, drinking status, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, showed that the beta coefficients of log blood Mn were 3.514, 1.878, and 2.517 for diastolic blood pressure, and 3.593, 2.449, and 2.440 for systolic blood pressure in female, male, and all participants, respectively. Multiple regression analysis including three other blood metals, lead, mercury, and cadmium, revealed no significant effects of the three metals on blood pressure and showed no effect on the association between blood Mn and blood pressure. In addition, doubling the blood Mn increased the risk of hypertension 1.828, 1.573, and 1.567 fold in women, men, and all participants, respectively, after adjustment for covariates. The addition of blood lead, mercury, and cadmium as covariates did not affect the association between blood Mn and the prevalence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: Blood Mn level was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in a representative sample of the Korean adult population.

19210288|t|Systematic review: clinical efficacy of chelator agents and zinc in the initial treatment of Wilson disease.
19210288|a|BACKGROUND: No consensus is available on the optimal initial treatment in Wilson disease. AIM: To assess systematically the available literature of treatment in newly presenting patients with a presymptomatic, hepatic or neurological presentation of Wilson disease. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases was performed. Original studies on clinical efficacy of D-penicillamine, trientine, tetrathiomolybdate or zinc monotherapy as initial treatment in Wilson disease were included. A descriptive analysis of the relevant published data was performed. RESULTS: One randomized trial and 12 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were quite heterogeneous and generally of low validity. Nevertheless, according to currently available data, patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson disease are probably most effectively treated by D-penicillamine. Zinc seems to be preferred above d-penicillamine for treatment of presymptomatic and neurological patients, as in these subgroups, the tolerance profile is in favour of zinc, while no obvious differences in clinical efficacy could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of high-quality evidence to estimate the relative treatment effects of the available drugs in Wilson disease. Therefore, multicentre prospective randomized controlled comparative trials are necessary.

21521834|t|Pharmacodynamic evaluation of pantoprazole therapy on clopidogrel effects: results of a prospective, randomized, crossover study.
21521834|a|BACKGROUND: Safety concerns have recently emerged based on a drug interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors leading to reduced pharmacodynamic effects. However, whether such drug interaction is a class effect or a drug effect and if this can be modulated by timing of drug administration remains a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of high-dose pantoprazole therapy, a proton pump inhibitor with low potential to interfere with clopidogrel metabolism, administered concomitantly or staggered, on clopidogrel-mediated pharmacodynamic effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, randomized, crossover study conducted in 20 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive pantoprazole (80 mg daily) administered concomitantly (CONC) or staggered by 8 to 12 hours (STAG) for 1 week on a background of clopidogrel therapy (600-mg loading dose followed by a 75-mg maintenance dose during all phases) in a crossover fashion with a 2- to 4-week washout period between treatments. All subjects had a 1-week treatment phase with a clopidogrel-only regimen with a 2- to 4-week washout period from randomization sequence. Platelet function was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of the status of phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, light transmittance aggregometry after adenosine diphosphate stimuli, and VerifyNow P2Y(12) system at 3 time points: baseline, 24 hours after loading dose, and 1 week after maintenance dose. The primary end point was the comparison of P2Y(12) reactivity index assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein at 1 week. After 1 week, there were no significant difference in P2Y(12) reactivity index between the CONC and STAG regimens (least-squares mean ±SEM, 56.0 ±3.9% versus 56.1 ±3.9%; P=0.974), as well as when compared with the clopidogrel-only regimen (61.0 ±3.9%; P=0.100 versus CONC and P=0.107 versus STAG). Further, no differences were observed at baseline and 24 hours between regimens. Concordant results were obtained by light transmittance aggregometry and VerifyNow P2Y(12) assays. CONCLUSIONS: Pantoprazole therapy used at high doses is not associated with modulation of the pharmacodynamic effects of clopidogrel, irrespective of timing of drug administration.

23943734|t|Premedication with clonidine before TIVA optimizes surgical field visualization and shortens duration of endoscopic sinus surgery - results of a clinical trial.
23943734|a|BACKGROUND: During functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), intraoperative bleeding can significantly compromise visualization of the surgical field. Clonidine constricts peripheral blood vessels and reduces systemic blood pressure, which in combination decrease nasal mucosa blood flow. This dual effect can potentially reduce bleeding during FESS and stabilize the intraoperative hemodynamic profile of the patient. AIM: The aim of this prospective study was to assess if the quality of the surgical field visualization during FESS was improved when clonidine was used as a premedication agent. METHODOLOGY: A group of 44 patients undergoing FESS for chronic sinusitis and polyp removal were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either oral clonidine or midazolam as preoperative premedication. During the operation, the quality of the surgical field was assessed and graded by the operating surgeon using the scale proposed by Boezaart. The evaluations were done during surgery at 15 minutes (K1), 30 minutes (K2), 60 minutes (K3) and 120 minutes (K4) after incision. RESULTS: The duration of the surgical procedure was significantly shorter in the clonidine group: mean time of surgery: 80 vs. 96 min in the clonidine and midazolam groups, respectively. Also better quality of surgical field was observed at all time points in the clonidine group. CONCLUSION: Premedication with clonidine before FESS results in shortening of the surgical time and a better quality of the surgical field.

17883883|t|A reappraisal of the clinical efficacy of nebulized flunisolide in pediatric asthma: the Italian experience.
17883883|a|Flunisolide (FLU) is a synthetic corticosteroid with potent topical anti-inflammatory activity. Its oral bioavailability is poor (6.7%). After gastrointestinal and lung absorption, the drug undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism by the liver to an inactive 6beta-hydroxylated metabolite. Plasma half-life is estimated to be 3.9 to 4.6 hours. FLU has a low volume of distribution at steady state and a short terminal half-life after inhalation (96 L and 1.6 hour, respectively). FLU, like budesonide, has a short pulmonary residence time and it is hypothesized that it may undergo esterification in the cell due to the presence of a free hydroxyl group at C21. Nebulization may offer important advantages over other inhalation methods. Nebulizers allow drug delivery in very young children through passive inhalation, depending less on patient coordination and cooperation. Comparative studies indicate that FLU is nebulized to a better advantage than beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide. This is attributed to its elevated water solubility. The aim of this article is to outline the factors that influence drug nebulization and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of FLU compared to other inhaled corticosteroids. In addition, we report a series of clinical data regarding the efficacy of nebulized FLU with focus on the Italian experience. Overall, the physicochemical characteristics and pharmacokinetic profile of FLU favor its use for nebulization. Clinical data indicate that nebulized FLU is effective in asthma treatment in infants and children. Side effects were not reported at the commonly used doses.

16788562|t|New aspects of cadmium as endocrine disruptor.
16788562|a|Cadmium (Cd) is an industrial and environmental pollutant that exerts adverse effects on a number of organs in humans and animals. Reproductive organs, such as the testis and placenta, are sensitive to the toxic effects of Cd. In animal experiments, high-dose exposure to Cd induced severe testicular interstitial hemorrhage with edema, and increased incidence of fetal death and placental necrosis. Low-dose exposure to Cd affects steroid synthesis in male and female reproductive organs. In 1998, the Ministry of Environment in Japan listed Cd in the strategy plan SPEED98 as one of the chemicals suspected of having possible endocrine disrupting activity. Recently, it has been shown that Cd has potent estrogen- and androgen-like activities in vivo and in vitro, by directly binding to estrogen and androgen receptors. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of Cd as an endocrine disruptor remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will discuss evidence thus far presented concerning the effects of Cd on the endocrine system.

8566979|t|Topical treatment of genital warts in men, an open study of podophyllotoxin cream compared with solution.
8566979|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a 0.15% and a 0.3% cream formulation of podophyllotoxin in comparison with the 0.5% solution in the treatment of condylomata acuminata and to compare the treatment modalities regarding side effects. DESIGN: The study was designed as an open randomised trial. Ninety male patients with signs of penile HPV infection, with either acuminate or papular lesions, were randomised into three parallel treatment groups. The study medication comprised 0.15% and 0.3% cream and 0.5% solution of podophyllotoxin. The patients treated themselves twice daily for three consecutive days and if total regression of the warts was not achieved after this first treatment cycle, further treatment cycles at 7-day intervals were to be repeated up to a maximum of four treatments. SETTING: The study was carried out in three outpatient clinics: two STD clinics, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital (45 patients) and Institut Antoine Fournier, Paris (30 patients), and one military hospital, S1/FO 47/48, Sjukhusenheten, EnkÃ¶ping (15 patients). RESULTS: Statistical evaluation of the treatment effect was based on a "Response rate" calculation at each visit. The number of completely responding patients after the first, second, third and fourth cycle were 40 (44%), 61 (68%), 67 (74%) and 70 (78%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the three treatments after four treatment cycles. However, the 0.15% cream had a significantly slower onset of efficacy as compared with the 0.3% cream and 0.5% solution. Adverse effects were less severe and less frequent with the 0.15% cream than with the other treatment modalities. Severe adverse effects were reported by 12 patients, of whom two were treated with 0.15% cream, five with 0.3% cream and five with 0.5% solution. Thirty-one patients were completely free from adverse effects. CONCLUSION: In this open randomised study with three parallel treatment groups, two cream formulations of 0.15% and 0.3% podophyllotoxin and a 0.5% solution of the same drug all showed an equally good response rate after four treatment cycles. Reported adverse effects were few and mild. The convenience of having different formulations to offer when prescribing treatment for condylomata must be considered.

24778039|t|Impact of Epoetin-beta on anemia and health-related quality of life in cancer patients: a prospective observational study using the generic 15D instrument.
24778039|a|AIM: Cancer-related anemia has a negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our aim was to evaluate prospectively the effect of treatment of anemia with an erythropoietin on the hemoglobin level and HRQoL in cancer patients with anemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (N=114) treated for the first time with epoetin (epoetin beta 30000 IU/wk, NeoRecormon ®) for anemia during cancer treatment were eligible for study inclusion. Baseline characteristics were collected from patients' records. HRQoL was measured by the generic 15D instrument and fatigue by visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline and four months from the start of the treatment with epoetin. The majority (87%) of patients had solid tumors; 69% with a metastatic disease and 89% disease with comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin concentration (SD) in blood increased from 96.6 (8.9) g/L to 112.9 (21.2) g/L, by 16.5 (20.6) g/L (p<0.0001). The mean 15D score rose from 0.72 to 0.77. The change was statistically significant (p=0.0047) and clinically important. The mean fatigue VAS score decreased by 16.0 points, or from 55.4 to 38.4 (+24.4) (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Correction of anemia increased the health-related quality of life in anemic cancer patients, as measured with the generic 15D instrument and the fatigue VAS.

8489792|t|Kawasaki disease in Adelaide: a review.
8489792|a|The role of Kawasaki disease (KD) as a contributor to early childhood cardiac morbidity in Adelaide was investigated by a review of hospital admission and case-note data from January 1979 to June 1990. There were 57 episodes in 55 patients. The epidemiological data in this South Australian series are similar to that seen in other Australian and New Zealand centres and correlate better with the clinical data from North America than from Japan. The average age of admission was 3.2 years (median 2.7 years) with 38 and 85% of cases being less than 2 and 5 years respectively. The male to female ratio was 1.5. The incidence of KD in the 0-5 year age group was 3.9 cases per 100,000 children. This series represents a minimum number of cases for this period and illustrates an association of aneurysm-risk with prolonged fever; improved defervescence with the combination of intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) and aspirin compared with aspirin alone; and a more severe disease process in the very young. The series supports the efficacy of single dose IVGG therapy. Antibiotics were given prior to diagnosis of KD in 79% of patients, often causing diagnostic confusion with possible drug reactions. The pathogenic mechanisms of KD are reviewed and a new hypothesis is proposed that incorporate mechanisms of vessel pathology resulting from release of endothelin and recognized mediators of endothelial damage including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta.

1653780|a|The effects of three non-myelotoxic cancer drugs on the growth of neuroblastoma cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo: dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa, a drug with selective toxicity for melanoma cells), DL-buthionine sulphoximine (BSO, a drug with radiosensitizing effects), and tamoxifen (a drug used in the treatment of human mammary carcinoma). In vivo these substances significantly reduced the weight of neuroblastoma tumour transplants in the mice (nude/nude) (P less than 0.05). A dose/effect relationship could be established. In vitro, the D50 was determined, using fibroblasts as controls. The growth of neuroblastoma tumours was inhibited by different mechanisms: L-dopa and its metabolite dopamine reduced the activity of tyrosinase, BSO reduced glutathione levels, and L-dopa and tamoxifen raised cAMP concentrations.

2009182|t|Epidermoid carcinoma of the pharynx. Therapeutic results in a series of 221 patients.
2009182|a|Two hundred and twenty-one cases of epidermoid carcinoma of the pharynx diagnosed between 1965 and 1984 were analysed. Fifty-seven per cent of the carcinomas were poorly differentiated and 57% of the patients had stage IV disease; 65% had lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. Radiotherapy was the primary treatment. Between 1977 and 1979, preirradiation chemotherapy was used and from 1979 the effect of the radiosensitizer misonidazole was investigated in split-course radiotherapy. Loco-regional failure occurred in 60% after primary treatment. No changes in treatment results were observed during four consecutive 5-year periods. The five-year corrected actuarial survival rate in the whole series was 33%. It is concluded that the treatment results are still unsatisfactory, and that chemotherapy, optimized radiotherapy, and radiosensitizers as used in the present series did not seem to improve the results. Alcohol and tobacco restriction is emphasized for prevention.

23182088|t|Synthesis and anticancer activity of a novel series of 9-O-substituted berberine derivatives: a lipophilic substitute role.
23182088|a|To alter its hydrophobicity, a series of compounds bearing 9-O-alkyl- or 9-O-terpenyl- substituted berberine were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer activity against human cancer HepG2 and HT29 cell lines. We found that the lipophilic substitute of 9-O-alkyl- and 9-O-terpenyl berberine derivatives plays a role in inhibiting the human cancer cell growth and its activity could be maximized with the optimized substitute type and chain length. Most strikingly, nonetheless, of the six compounds prepared, sample 8, a farnesyl 9-O-substituted berberine, showed either comparable or better cytotoxic activity against human cancer HepG2 cell line than that of berberine. Compound 8 had also shown a 104-fold antiproliferation activity in compare with berberine against human hepatoma HepG2 cell lines after 48 incubation hours. Further, in Hoechst 33258 and annexin V-FITC/PI staining analyses it induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells at lower concentration than that of berberine for 24h. Take all; farnesyl 9-O-substituted berberine could be a potential candidate for new anticancer drug development.

15804854|t|A fuzzy logic based closed-loop control system for blood glucose level regulation in diabetics.
15804854|a|In this study, a closed-loop system to control the plasma glucose level in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 is proposed. This control scheme is based on fuzzy logic control theory to maintain a normoglycaemic average of 4.5 mmol 1(-1) and the normal conditions for free plasma insulin concentration in severe initial state; in particular, when the diabetic patient is subjected to a glucose meal disturbance or fluctuations in the measured glucose level due to error in the measuring instrument. The proposed controller has demonstrated superiority over other conventional controlling therapies. While fuzzy logic controllers have shown promising results in many fields, a comparative study is presented with well-known conventional controllers such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and continuous insulin infusion control strategies. The simulated results, for the proposed controller, are presented and discussed.

14655912|t|Report of a case of immunosuppression with prednisone in an 8-year-old boy with an acute onset of hypocretin-deficiency narcolepsy.
14655912|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore whether acute destruction of hypocretin cells in a patient with narcolepsy could be detected and if the course of the disease could be reversed or altered by the use of prednisone for immunosuppression. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A sleep-clinic population in a tertiary-care hospital. PATIENT: An 8-year-old boy with a very acute recent (< 2 month) onset of sleepiness. METHODS: Sleep studies; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging studies with a focus on the hypothalamus; examinations of cerebrospinal fluid for cytology, protein, and hypocretin-1 levels; and HLA typing were performed. INTERVENTION: A 3-week regimen of 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of prednisone was administered in an attempt to modify the course of the disease. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Sleep evaluations were consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Hypocretin-1 was absent in the cerebrospinal fluid, and HLA-DQB1*0602 was present. All other results were within normal limits, and prednisone did not have any noticeable effects. Clinical manifestation of narcolepsy might occur when the hypocretin cell damage is too advanced to be reversible.

22727954|t|Outpatient treatment of infantile hemangiomas with propranolol: a prospective study.
22727954|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the  safety and effectiveness of oral propranolol  (OP) in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a prospective study of infantile hemangiomas  (IHs) treated with oral propranolol between October 2008 and March 2011. We included fast-growing IHs in the proliferative  phase, IHs affecting vital structures, ulcerated IHs, and IHs that could cause functional or aesthetic problems after the proliferative phase. The patients  received oral propranolol 2mg/kg/d and were monitored on an outpatient basis. Response to treatment was assessed  by volume reduction, lightening of color, improvement of symptoms, and parent satisfaction. Time of initial and peak response, as well as side effects and sequelae, were recorded. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 IHs, corresponding to 17  girls and 3 boys. The main sites of involvement were around the eyes (20%), the nose (15%), the neck (15%), and the trunk (15%). Ninety percent of the hemangiomas were focal and in the proliferative phase. Treatment was started between the ages of 2 and 19 months and the main  reason for starting treatment was rapid growth  (50% of cases). Initial response was observed in 70% of cases and only in 2 of them it took over a month. Peak response occurred at 3 months. All the IHs responded to treatment; response was excellent in 55% of cases, good in 35%, and minimal in 10%. The following factors were predictive of response: focal IH, proliferative phase, periorbital location, and ulceration. No serious side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Oral propranolol was clinically effective in reducing the volume and color of infantile hemangiomas, although the reduction was not complete and telangiectasia and scarring persisted after treatment. Oral propranolol also proved to be safe for use in outpatients.

9501850|t|Pfmdr1 Asn1042Asp and Asp1246Tyr polymorphisms, thought to be associated with chloroquine resistance, are present in chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive Brazilian field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum.
9501850|a|Parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, is the most disturbing problem of malaria chemotherapy. There is evidence that the codon 86Tyr polymorphism of the Pfmdr1 gene is associated with chloroquine resistance in West African Plasmodium falciparum. The association of this and four other coding alterations of the Pfmdr1 gene with chloroquine resistance has not been extensively investigated in South American isolates. In this study, we examined 51 Brazilian P. falciparum isolates for the presence or absence of Asn86Tyr, Asn1042Asp, and Asp1246Tyr polymorphisms. While these isolates were all sensitive in vitro to mefloquine, amodiaquine, and quinine, only 2 (4%) were chloroquine-sensitive. The findings reported here provide the first observations of this kind on a large number of field parasite samples from South America. We show that in vitro chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive strains carry the Asn1042Asp and Asp1246Tyr polymorphisms and provide support for earlier suggestions that Asn86Tyr may be rare or absent in South American P. falciparum.

9642483|t|Optimum treatment of stable angina pectoris.
9642483|a|From a therapeutic point of view, angina pectoris is best thought of as an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. Oxygen supply to the heart can be increased by improving endothelial function to increase vasodilation. Non-endothelial-mediated vasodilation will also help increase coronary flow. Coronary vasodilators, such as the calcium blockers and nitrates, are effective agents in relieving vasoconstriction and improving coronary blood flow. Reduction of oxygen demand is accomplished by decreasing heart rate, blood pressure, heart size, and left ventricular mass. Beta-blockers and heart rate-lowering calcium entry blockers are effective in reducing oxygen demand. Additive effects occur by combining a beta-blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium entry blocker. Together with reduction of risk factors, this combination therapy plus aspirin provides optimal management of patients with angina pectoris.

15740555|t|Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium delivers bioequivalent MPA exposure compared with mycophenolate mofetil.
15740555|a|Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active moiety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is routinely used as an adjunct immunosuppressant therapy in renal transplantation. Although highly effective, MMF therapy is associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an advanced formulation delivering MPA. The enteric coat dissolves at pH > 5 allowing for MPA delivery in the small intestine. A single-center, open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study of 24 stable Caucasian renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, compared the relative bioavailability of two EC-MPS doses (640 and 720 mg) with MMF (1000 mg). Both EC-MPS doses delivered bioequivalent mean MPA exposure (AUC(0-infinity)) compared with 1000 mg MMF: 60.7 microg h/mL for 640 mg EC-MPS, 66.5 microg h/mL for 720 mg EC-MPS, and 63.7 microg h/mL for 1000 mg MMF. Median t(max) was significantly delayed for both EC-MPS doses compared with MMF (2.0 h vs. 0.75 h, respectively; p < 0.01), consistent with a functional enteric coating of EC-MPS. Furthermore, both EC-MPS doses were bioequivalent to 1000 mg MMF for AUC and C(max) for mycophenolic acid glucuronide. All three treatments were well tolerated. The EC-MPS 720 mg dose most closely approximated the MPA exposure of 1000 mg MMF and was selected for subsequent phase III studies.

2255262|t|Effect of calcium pidolate on biochemical and hormonal parameters in involutional osteoporosis.
2255262|a|The purpose of this study was to determine the value of calcium pidolate in the treatment of involutional osteoporosis. This compound has been reported to be better absorbed than other calcium salts, to lower the levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and to raise those of growth hormone (GH). We accordingly treated one group of 10 women suffering from involutional osteoporosis with the equivalent of 1 g elemental calcium and administered a placebo to a second group of 10 osteoporotic women whose mean age and body surface area were comparable. Basal sequential multiple analysis (SMA-12) was performed in all subjects to determine calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein levels, the same blood samples being used for the evaluation of mean PTH, GH and osteocalcin (BGP). Urinary 24-h calcium excretion was determined and the calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) and hydroxyproline/Cr (HP/Cr) ratios were measured in 12-h fasting urine samples, the results being corrected for glomerular filtrate. The same parameters were measured again following a month of uninterrupted treatment. After 30 days, we observed no differences in either group as regards calcaemia, phosphataemia, ALP, total proteins, PTH, GH, BGP or 24-hour calciuria. The only noteworthy changes seen were significant decreases (P less than 0.001) in the Ca/Cr and HP/Cr ratios in the group treated with calcium pidolate. These results show that calcium pidolate at the dose administered inhibits bone resorption but does not affect the levels of PTH, GH, BGP or ALP in the medium term. Our findings indicate that it has no influence on bone formation.

24513087|t|GABA(A) receptor dephosphorylation followed by internalization is coupled to neuronal death in in vitro ischemia.
24513087|a|Cerebral ischemia is characterized by an early disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission contributing to an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium and neuronal death, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here we report a downregulation of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) expression, affecting both mRNA and protein levels of GABA(A)R subunits, in hippocampal neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia. Similar alterations in the abundance of GABA(A)R subunits were observed in in vivo brain ischemia. OGD reduced the interaction of surface GABA(A)R with the scaffold protein gephyrin, followed by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization. Internalization of GABA(A)R was dependent on glutamate receptor activation and mediated by dephosphorylation of the b3 subunit at serine 408/409. Expression of phospho-mimetic mutant GABA(A)R b3 subunits prevented receptor internalization and protected hippocampal neurons from ischemic cell death. The results show a key role for b3 GABA(A)R subunit dephosphorylation in the downregulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in brain ischemia, contributing to neuronal death. GABA(A)R phosphorylation might be a therapeutic target to preserve synaptic inhibition in brain ischemia.

12817070|t|Hyperphosphataemia and treatment with sevelamer in haemodialysis patients.
12817070|a|More than 60% of patients on chronic haemodialysis (HD) have a serum phosphate level above 5.5 mg/dl (1.75 mmol/l), which recently has been recommended as an appropriate target in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Preventing hyperphosphataemia and elevated Ca x P product not only ameliorates the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone disease, but also appears to reduce cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality from vascular calcifications. Dietary phosphate restriction and the administration of aluminium and calcium salts have been the principal means of phosphate control over the last decade. Unfortunately, the protean disturbances of toxic aluminium accumulation in the body virtually eliminated aluminium from clinical practice. Calcium-based therapy, although well tolerated, results in frequent hypercalcaemia when administered concurrently with vitamin D analogues, despite a decrease in the concentration of dialysate calcium. Sevelamer (Renagel((R))) has been a novel, non-absorbable calcium- and aluminium-free synthetic polymer. In initial studies, sevelamer reduced serum phosphate, Ca x P product and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in a manner comparable with calcium acetate therapy. However, the effect on PTH levels may prove to be inconsistent. It seems somewhat less effective in binding phosphate than aluminium, although no direct comparisons have been made. In a recent study, it attenuated the progression of vascular calcification in HD patients. It also binds bile acids, resulting in substantially lower low-density lipo-protein cholesterol levels. The major obstacle to its current use is a substantial increase in the cost associated with sevelamer therapy.

10190652|t|Contribution of nitric oxide to beta2-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilatation in human forearm arterial vasculature.
10190652|a|AIMS: beta2-adrenoceptor agonists are generally considered to produce endothelium independent vasodilatation through adenylate cyclase. We determined whether nitric oxide contributes to beta2-adrenoceptor vasodilatation in human arterial vasculature. METHODS: Forearm blood flow responses to brachial intra-arterial infusions of ritodrine (2.5-50 microg min(-1)), a selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, were determined in 24 healthy, normotensive subjects (mean age 22 years, 5F) on two occasions with initial and concomitant administration of L-NMMA (800 microg min(-1)), an NO synthase inhibitor, or noradrenaline (5-30 ng min(-1)), a control constrictor not affecting basal NO activity. Responses to the endothelium dependent vasodilator scrotonin (n = 6) and an endothelium independent vasodilator GTN (n = 9) were also determined. RESULTS: Maximal dilatation to ritodrine during L-NMMA infusion (310+/-32%; mean+/-s.e.mean) was reduced compared to that during noradrenaline infusion (417+/-41%, P<0.05), as were summary responses (1023+/-101 vs 1415+/-130; P<0.05). Responses to GTN were unaffected by L-NMMA compared to noradrenaline; max 177+/-26 vs 169+/-20%, 95% CI for difference -33,48; P=0.68; summary response 361+/-51 vs 396+/-37, 95% CI -142,71; P=0.46. Dilator responses to serotonin were reduced by L-NMMA; max 64+/-20 vs 163+/-26%, P<0.01; summary response 129+/-36 vs 293+/-60; P<0.05) and to a greater extent than ritodrine (58+/-7 vs 25+/-14%, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: beta2-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilatation in the human forearm has an NO mediated component. The underlying mechanism for this effect is unclear, but flow mediated vasodilatation is unlikely to be responsible.

14699020|t|Betaine as a determinant of postmethionine load total plasma homocysteine before and after B-vitamin supplementation.
14699020|a|OBJECTIVE: Betaine is a substrate in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase reaction, converting homocysteine to methionine. There are only sparse data on plasma betaine as a determinant of the plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety patients undergoing coronary angiography were randomized into 4 groups administered oral: (1) folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B12 (0.4 mg), and vitamin B6 (40 mg); (2) folic acid and vitamin B12; (3) vitamin B6 alone; or (4) placebo. Nonfasting blood samples were collected at baseline and 3, 14, and 28 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start. A 4-hour methionine-loading test (0.1 g/kg) was performed at baseline and after 3 months. At baseline, median (interquartile range) plasma betaine was 36.9 micromol/L (range: 30.3 to 46.8) and was increased by 15% after methionine loading. The postmethionine load (PML) increase in tHcy was inversely related to plasma betaine (beta=-0.29, P=0.02) and even more strongly to PML betaine (beta=-0.47, P<0.001). After 3 months of intervention, the relation between the PML increase in tHcy and PML betaine was weakened (beta=-0.33, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma betaine is a strong determinant of the PML increase in tHcy in subjects not supplemented with B-vitamins.

15794402|t|Jessner-Kanof lymphocytic infiltration of the skin associated with glatiramer acetate.
15794402|a|Glatiramer acetate (GLAT) is a well tolerated and safe immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The most commonly recognized side effects are localized injection site reactions consisting of pain, pruritus, mild erythema and induration, which sometimes persist for several days. We describe the first case of a biopsy-proven lymphocytic infiltration (T-cell pseudolymphoma) with the clinical appearance of a figured erythema on the ventrolateral thighs in the first four weeks under GLAT treatment, resolving without any evidence of recurrence despite ongoing therapy. A T-cell pseudolymphoma is a very rare side effect of GLAT treatment. For clinical purposes it is important to state that re-exposition after GLAT-induced pseudolymphoma is possible without permanent sequelae.

12136223|t|Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when?
12136223|a|Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it "reasonable" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental.

22369329|t|Mechanisms and novel approaches in overriding tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.
22369329|a|Chronic myeloid leukemia is a stem cell-initiated but progenitor-driven disease induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were introduced in the late 1990s and have revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The majority of patients can now expect to live a normal life as long as they continue to comply with TKI treatment. However, in a significant proportion of cases TKI resistance develops over time, requiring a switch of therapy. The most frequent mechanism for drug resistance is the development of kinase domain mutations that reduce or completely ablate drug efficacy. Fortunately, the last 10 years have seen an impressive array of new drugs, some modeled on the mechanism of action of imatinib, others employing more novel approaches, for these patients.

12568734|t|Estrogen effect on heart rate variability in hypertensive postmenopausal women.
12568734|a|Healthy postmenopausal women and hypertensive patients show an imbalance in the modulation of autonomic nervous control of the cardiovascular system, which may increase the cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine the heart rate variability (HRV) response to estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and its association with changes in metabolic variables in hypertensive postmenopausal women. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 30 hypertensive postmenopausal women receiving 180 mg/day of verapamil. The experimental group (n=16) received 0.625 mg OD of natural conjugated estrogens during 4 months, while control group (n=14) received a placebo. Lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, glucose and insulin were measured at 0, 2 and 4 months. HRV was determined in time and frequency domains using a 24-h Holter before and after ERT. RESULTS: Significant higher values of spectral and non-spectral parameters of HRV, associated with a lower LF/HF ratio, were found at the end of 4 months of ERT. Multiple regression analysis revealed that estrogen treatment itself and changes in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose and waist circumference, contributed to the changes observed in indexes reflecting parasympathetic activity in time and frequency domains. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ERT partially improves HRV favoring increased parasympathetic drive, and that part of the effect may be mediated by changes in metabolic variables.

24063543|t|A stimulatory role of ozone exposure on human natural killer cells.
24063543|a|Ozone is claimed to have beneficial effects. While studies revealed the safe therapeutic use of ozone, there are conflicting results for the link between immune system and ozone encounter. Natural killer (NK) cells are important sentinels of immunity with their cytotoxic activity and immune-regulatory potentials. This study aimed to investigate the effects of direct ozone encountering on human immune system, at cellular level. Survival, proliferative capacity and subset content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were analysed. PBMC of healthy donors (n=5, mean age: 27 ±6 years) were exposed to 1,   5,   10 and 50    µg/mL doses of medical ozone, directly injected into culture wells, once, initially. 1 and 5    µg/mL doses didn't show toxic effects while 10 and 50    µg/mL doses were toxic. PBMC were cultured for 5 days following 1 and 5    µg/mL ozone encountering. 1    µg/mL dose increased numbers of CD3-CD16+/56+ NK cells among PBMC. Following stimulation with ozone, no difference was observed in basal and phytohemaglutinin-stimulated proliferative capacity. 1 and 5    µg/mL doses of ozone were found to increase NK cytotoxicity. These data indicates influential effects of transient ozone exposure on NK cells, which in turn may have a role in control of immune responses.

18779739|t|Investigation of gastric and duodenal mucosal defects caused by low-dose aspirin in patients with ischemic heart disease.
18779739|a|BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin is used for secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Currently, the frequency of gastrointestinal disorder among users of low-dose aspirin is unknown. AIMS: To investigate through endoscopic examination the frequency of gastroduodenal disorder associated with buffered and enteric-coated aspirin (ECA). METHODS: Screening upper endoscopic examinations were prospectively performed on 236 patients with ischemic heart disease. Endoscopic findings including ulcers and flat erosions were assessed as mucosal defects. RESULTS: Mucosal defects were found in 92 of 190 (48.4%) users of low-dose aspirin and 6 of 46 (13.0%) nonusers. There were significantly more mucosal defects among users of low-dose aspirin than among those using no aspirin (P<0.0001). Mucosal defects were found in 54 of 98 (60.7%) users of buffered aspirin (BA), whereas 38 of 101 (37.6%) users of ECA had mucosal defects. Users of ECA had significantly fewer erosions than did those of BA (P=0.0015). The frequency of ulcer is similar between BA users and ECA users. CONCLUSIONS: As endoscopy frequently reveals gastroduodenal disorder among low-dose aspirin users, both administration of BA and of enteric-coated aspirin warrant concern for gastroduodenal ulcer.

17263185|t|Phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitors: a novel approach to the treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia.
17263185|a|A disruption of corticostriatal signaling is believed to underlie the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and also contribute to many of the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. Phosphodiesterase (PDE)10A is a dual substrate PDE highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. Biochemical and behavioral studies indicate that the inhibition of PDE10A enhances striatal output by increasing activity in the cGMP and cAMP signaling pathways. PDE10A inhibitors reduce exploratory activity and antagonize the stimulant response to both amphetamine and N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists such as phencyclidine. Consistent with their potential as antipsychotic agents, PDE10A inhibitors are potent antagonists of conditioned avoidance responding. The presence of PDE10A in both striatal output pathways may reduce the incidence and severity of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist-like side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, by enhancing corticostriatal signaling, PDE10A inhibitors have the potential to improve some of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

16926330|t|Dobutamine response and myocardial infarct transmurality: functional improvement after coronary artery bypass grafting--initial experience.
16926330|a|The Investigational Review Board approved the protocol, and all patients provided signed informed consent. The protocol was compliant with HIPAA. The purpose of the study was to prospectively test the hypothesis that addition of low-dose dobutamine and quantification of inotropic reserve in segments with 1%-50% infarct transmurality (IT) would improve the predictive value for functional recovery after revascularization in chronic infarction. Fifteen patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction were enrolled prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to assess IT. The percentage of wall thickening was measured with cine cardiac MR imaging at rest and during infusion of 10 (microg . kg(-1))/min dobutamine. Repeat cardiac MR imaging was performed 20 weeks +/- 4 (standard error) later. Functional parameters according to segment were compared before and after CABG by using F tests with repeated-measures models. In segments with 1%-50% IT, similar functional recovery was noted in those with 1%-25% or 26%-50% IT. However, in the same segments, those that improved with dobutamine to normal range demonstrated greater improvement in the percentage of wall thickening (22% +/- 4) after revascularization than those that did not (9% +/- 4) (P < .04). In 1%-50% IT, a normal dobutamine response helps differentiate segments with greater functional recovery after CABG.

21346037|t|Beyond traditional outcomes: improving quality of life in patients with renal cell carcinoma.
21346037|a|The introduction of molecular targeted therapies for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma has provided treatment options that are more efficacious and better tolerated than cytokine therapy, the previous standard of care. These advances have led to renewed efforts to define the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impact of disease status stabilization or improvement versus that of treatment-associated adverse events. The distinct classes of targeted agents have unique AE profiles related to their specific targets; therefore, treatment considerations should include the patient's pretreatment HRQOL along with the known HRQOL effects of each drug. With more second- and third-line treatment options available for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, HRQOL outcomes in earlier lines of therapy may guide treatment decisions for subsequent therapy, as poor HRQOL at therapy onset predicts poor survival. Both general and disease-specific instruments are used in clinical trials to reveal the impact of treatment on patient-reported outcomes. In this article, the common instruments used to assess HRQOL and the HRQOL outcomes observed in pivotal trials of targeted therapies are reviewed. Current data indicate that first-line therapy with sunitinib and first-line therapy in poor-prognosis patients with temsirolimus provide improved HRQOL compared with interferon-a. First- and second-line therapy with pazopanib and second-line therapy with everolimus and sorafenib maintained HRQOL levels similar to placebo, indicating that these agents do not worsen HRQOL. The HRQOL effects of bevacizumab plus IFN-a have not been reported. As new agents enter clinical investigation, HRQOL data can help determine their overall role in treatment.

15720887|t|Haematological changes in African children who received short-term prophylaxis with nevirapine and zidovudine at birth.
15720887|a|We assessed the safety of short-term antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV by monitoring haematological changes in children up to the age of 18 months. Babies of HIV-infected women were randomised at birth to receive a single dose of nevirapine (NVP) alone or with zidovudine (ZDV) twice daily for a week. Based on the time of presentation to the labour ward, mothers of these babies might or might not have received intrapartum NVP. Complete blood counts were performed at birth and at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months. Babies' HIV status was determined by HIV-1 RNA testing. A total of 1755 babies were included in the study. Age-specific mean haemoglobin levels and prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 10 g/dL) were not significantly different in cases where only the babies received a single dose of NVP and cases where NVP was given to mother/infant pairs or additional ZDV to the baby. Among HIV-infected children compared with uninfected children, the age-specific frequency of anaemia was significantly greater, anaemia started earlier and recovery to normal levels was slower and prolonged. A reversible granulocytopenia was observed in all children between 1.5 and 3 months of age. HIV infection significantly increased the children's risk of death. Antiretroviral prophylaxis appeared to protect against anaemia and child death. Short regimens of antiretrovirals to prevent MTCT of HIV are not associated with long-term adverse haematological changes.

21398612|t|Mechanism of endosomal TLR inhibition by antimalarial drugs and imidazoquinolines.
21398612|a|Endosomal TLRs play an important role in innate immune response as well as in autoimmune processes. In the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus, antimalarial drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine have been used for a long time. Their suppression of endosomal TLR activation has been attributed to the inhibition of endosomal acidification, which is a prerequisite for the activation of these receptors. We discovered that chloroquine inhibits only activation of endosomal TLRs by nucleic acids, whereas it augments activation of TLR8 by a small synthetic compound, R848. We detected direct binding of antimalarials to nucleic acids by spectroscopic experiments and determined their cellular colocalization. Further analysis revealed that other nucleic acid-binding compounds, such as propidium iodide, also inhibited activation of endosomal TLRs and colocalized with nucleic acids to endosomes. We found that imidazoquinolines, which are TLR7/8 agonists, inhibit TLR9 and TLR3 even in the absence of TLR7 or TLR8, and their mechanism of inhibition is similar to the antimalarials. In contrast to bafilomycin, none of the tested antimalarials and imidazoquinolines inhibited endosomal proteolysis or increased the endosomal pH, confirming that inhibition of pH acidification is not the underlying cause of inhibition. We conclude that the direct binding of inhibitors to nucleic acids mask their TLR-binding epitope and may explain the efficiency of those compounds in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

18457892|t|Safety of raw meat and shellfish in Vietnam: an analysis of Escherichia coli isolations for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes.
18457892|a|This study was conducted to examine a current baseline profile of antimicrobial resistance and virulence of Escherichia coli isolated from foods commonly sold in the market place in Vietnam. E. coli were isolated from 180 samples of raw meat, poultry and shellfish and also isolated from 43 chicken faeces samples. Ninety-nine E. coli isolates recovered from all sources were selected for the investigation of their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents by the disk diffusion method. Eighty-four percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, and multi-resistance, defined as resistance to at least 3 different classes of antibiotics, was detected in all sources. The rates of multi-resistance were up to 89.5% in chicken, 95% in chicken faeces and 75% in pork isolates. Resistance was most frequently observed to tetracycline (77.8%), sulfafurazole (60.6%), ampicillin (50.5%), amoxicillin (50.5%), trimethoprim (51.5%), chloramphenicol (43.4%), streptomycin (39.4%), nalidixic acid (34.3%) and gentamicin (24.2%). In addition, the isolates also displayed resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 16.2%, norfloxacin 17.2%, and enrofloxacin 21.2%), with chicken isolates showing the highest rates of resistance to these antibiotics (52.6-63.2%). Thirty-eight multi-resistant isolates were selected for further the examination of antibiotic resistance genes and were also evaluated for virulence gene profiles by multiplex and uniplex polymerase chain reaction. The beta-lactam TEM gene and tetracycline resistance tetA, tetB genes were frequently detected in the tested isolates (84.2% and 89.5% respectively). Genes which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin (aadA) (68.4%), chloramphenicol (cmlA) (42.1%), sulfonamides (sulI) (39.5%), trimethoprim (dhfrV) (26.3%) and kanamycin (aphA-1) (23.7%) were also widely distributed. Plasmid-mediated ampC genes were detected in E. coli isolates from chicken and pork. The isolates were tested for the presence of 58 virulence genes for adhesins, toxins, capsule synthesis, siderophores, invasins and others from different E. coli pathotypes. All of the tested isolates contained at least one virulence gene and there were 16 genes detected. Virulence genes detected were fimH (92.1%), bmaE (84.2%), TSPE4.C2 (42.1%), aidA AIDA-I (orfB) (31.6%), east1 (26.3%), traT (23.7%), and others including fyuA, iutA, chuA, yjaA, iss, iroN(E. coli), ibeA, aah (orfA), iha and papG allele III (10.5-2.6%). Typical toxin genes produced by enterohemorrhagic and enterotoxigenic E. coli pathotypes (a heat-stable toxin (ST), heat-labile toxin (LT) and Shiga toxin stx1, stx2) were not detected in any of these 38 isolates. The study has revealed that E. coli in raw foods is a significant reservoir of resistance and virulence genes.

9462563|t|Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: acute results and 3-month follow-up in 25 patients.
9462563|a|OBJECTIVES: We report the acute results and midterm clinical course after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). BACKGROUND: In the treatment of HOCM, surgical myectomy and DDD pacemaker therapy are considered the standard procedural extensions to drug therapy with negatively inotropic drugs. As an alternative nonsurgical procedure for reducing the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient, PTSMA by alcohol-induced septal branch occlusion was introduced. However, clinical follow-up has not been sufficiently described. METHODS: In 25 patients (13 women, 12 men; mean [+/- SD] age 54.7 +/- 15.0 years) who were symptomatic despite sufficient drug therapy, 1.4 +/- 0.6 septal branches were occluded with an injection of 4.1 +/- 2.6 ml of alcohol (96%) to ablate the hypertrophied interventricular septum. After 3-months, follow-up results of LVOT gradients and clinical course were determined. RESULTS: The invasively determined LVOT gradients could be reduced in 22 patients (88%), with a mean reduction from 61.8 +/- 29.8 mm Hg (range 4 to 152) to 19.4 +/- 20.8 mm Hg (range 0 to 74) at rest (p < 0.0001) and from 141.4 +/- 45.3 mm Hg (range 76 to 240) to 61.1 +/- 40.1 mm Hg (range 0 to 135) after extrasystole. All patients had angina pectoris for 24 h. The maximal creatine kinase increase was 780 +/- 436 U/liter (range 305 to 1,810) after 11.1 +/- 6.0 h (range 4 to 24). Thirteen patients (52%) developed a trifascicular block for 5 min to 8 days requiring temporary (n = 8 [32%]) or permanent (DDD) pacemaker implantation (n = 5 [20%]). An 86-year old woman died 8 days after successful intervention of uncontrollable ventricular fibrillation in conjunction with beta-sympathomimetics in chronically obstructive pulmonary disease. The remaining patients were discharged after 11.3 +/- 5.4 days (range 5 to 24), after an uncomplicated hospital course. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was achieved in all 24 surviving patients after 3 months. No cardiac complications occurred. Twenty-one patients (88%) showed clinical improvement, with a New York Heart Association functional class of 1.4 +/- 1.1. A further reduction in LVOT gradient was shown in 14 patients (58%). CONCLUSIONS: PTSMA of HOCM is a promising nonsurgical technique for septal myocardial reduction, with a consecutive reduction in LVOT gradient. Possible complications are trifascicular blocks, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, and tachycardiac rhythm disturbances. Clinical long-term observations of larger patient series and a comparison with conventional forms of therapy are necessary to determine the conclusive therapeutic significance.

8672996|t|Dosing time with ascorbic acid and nitrate, gum and tobacco chewing, fasting, and other factors affecting N-nitrosoproline formation in healthy subjects taking proline with a standard meal.
8672996|a|The N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) test measures the potential for intragastric formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines in humans. Nitrate and L-proline are administered to volunteers. Noncarcinogenic NPRO is produced by an acid-catalyzed reaction of proline (a model for ingested amines) with nitrate-derived nitrite in the stomach. It is then absorbed and excreted in the urine, which is analyzed for NPRO. We studied the effect of certain dietary and other factors on the levels of urinary NPRO. For (generally) 5 days, healthy adult subjects (mostly men) followed a diet low in preformed NPRO, nitrate, proline, and (on days 4 and 5) ascorbic acid. The tests were conducted on days 4 and 5. In the standard test, the subjects took 400 mg nitrate at 11 a.m., and at noon they ate a standard 700-calorie meal containing 500 mg proline. (In previous tests, proline was given 1 h after or between meals.) Urines were collected for 24 h, and samples were analyzed for NPRO by published methods. This standard test yielded 26 +/- 2 (mean +/- SE) nmol NPRO compared with 5 +/- 1 nmol NPRO when proline alone was taken. In variations of the standard test, NPRO yield was not significantly affected by the subjects' gender, the time at which the standard meal was eaten, the size of the meal, or the drinking of extra water after the meal. Doses of 100 and 200 mg nitrate had lesser effects on NPRO yield than did the dose of 400 mg nitrate. Nitrate (400 mg) produced the most NPRO when it was given 1 h before the meal. Fasting increased NPRO yield by 3-4 times compared to giving proline with a meal. One g of ASC given 5 or 2 h before, with, or 1 or 2 h after the meal with proline inhibited NPRO formation by mean values of 0, 71, 71, 67, and 19%, respectively. Chewing gum or tobacco for 2-3 h after the test meal did not increase NPRO formation or salivary nitrate levels, but salivary nitrite was not taken, chewing tobacco appeared to increase salivary nitrite and nitrate levels. The weak carcinogen N-nitrososarcosine (NSAR) was also detected in some tests, and the standard group showed 21 +/- 3 nmol NSAR. A high NSAR result (44 +/- 7 nmol) for women undergoing the standard test should be reexamined. We discuss applying these results to the conduct of future NPRO tests, as well as their implications for reducing the potential production of carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach.

18422480|t|Omega-3 fatty acid concentrates in the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia.
18422480|a|BACKGROUND: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia is fairly common, and elevated triglycerides are a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA have been shown to lower triglycerides in many clinical studies. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid concentrates (P-OM3) are indicated for use in people with very high triglycerides (> 500 mg/dl). Current guidelines recommend that triglycerides should be less < 150 mg/dl. OBJECTIVE: This review provides an overview of the use of omega-3 concentrates (both P-OM3 and over-the-counter fish oil) to lower triglycerides in people who have moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides in the range of 150 - 500 mg/dl). The objectives were to examine clinical evidence, describe the magnitude of effects and predict future clinical use of P-OM3. METHODS: Published, peer-reviewed studies of omega-3 concentrates were included if they were placebo-controlled, double-blind, of sufficient size to demonstrate triglyceride lowering, and studied a population described as having a mean baseline triglyceride value of 150 - 500 mg/dl. Studies using the 4-g dose of P-OM3 were used to develop a model of percent triglyceride lowering as a function of baseline levels. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: P-OM3 are effective in reducing triglycerides by approximately 30% in this population and are likely to be combined with other drugs (e.g., statins) to treat combined dyslipidemia.

11204550|t|Dose-dependent toxicity of diphenhydramine overdose.
11204550|a|BACKGROUND: Diphenhydramine (DPHM) overdose is a frequent cause of acute poisoning. Although its clinical features are well known, information about the dose-dependent toxicity of DPHM is still scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate the dose-dependent toxicity of DPHM in patients with acute DPHM poisoning. METHODS: We have analyzed retrospectively all well-documented cases with DPHM monointoxications reported by physicians to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre (STIC) between January 1984 and April 1996. In addition, a prospective study focusing on ingested DPHM doses and severity of symptoms was performed between May 1996 and December 1998. RESULTS: The retrospective and prospective studies included 232 and 50 patients with DPHM monointoxications, respectively. In both studies, mild symptoms (somnolence, anticholinergic signs, tachycardia, nausea/vomiting) occurred in 55-64%, moderate symptoms (isolated and spontaneously resolving agitation, confusion, hallucinations and ECG disturbances) in 22-27% and severe symptoms (delirium/psychosis, seizures, coma) in 14-18% of patients. Moderate symptoms occurred above ingested doses of 0.3 g DPHM. For severe symptoms the critical dose limit was 1.0 g DPHM. Although the frequency of delirium/psychosis remained constant or even decreased, coma and seizures were significantly (p<0.05) more frequent in the >1.5-g compared with the 1.0- to 1.5-g-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a clear dose-dependent acute toxicity of DPHM. They indicate that only patients with DPHM ingestions above 1.0 g are at risk for the development of severe symptoms and, therefore, should be hospitalized. Thus, the results contribute to the data basis required for a cost effective management of patients with DPHM overdose.

25065371|t|In vivo HIV-1 hypermutation and viral loads among antiretroviral-naive Brazilian patients.
25065371|a|Hypermutation alludes to an excessive number of specific guanine-to-adenine (G- >A) substitutions in proviral DNA and this phenomenon is attributed to the catalytic activity of cellular APOBECs. Population studies relating hypermutation and the progression of infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been performed to elucidate the effect of hypermutation on the natural course of HIV-1 infection. However, the many different approaches employed to assess hypermutation in nucleotide sequences render the comparison of results difficult. This study selected 157 treatment-naive patients and sought to correlate the hypermutation level of the proviral sequences in clinical samples with demographic variables, HIV-1 RNA viral load, and the level of CD4(+) T cells. Nested touchdown polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with specific primers to detect hypermutation in the region of HIV-1 integrase, and the amplified sequences were run in agarose gels with HA-Yellow. The analysis of gel migration patterns using the k-means clustering method was validated by its agreement with the results obtained with the software Hypermut. Hypermutation was found in 31.2% of the investigated samples, and a correlation was observed between higher hypermutation levels and higher viral load levels. These findings suggest a high frequency of hypermutation detection in a Brazilian cohort, which can reflect a particular characteristic of this population, but also can result from the method approach by aiming at hypermutation-sensitive sites. Furthermore, we found that hypermutation events are pervasive during HIV-1 infection as a consequence of high viral replication, reflecting its role during disease progression.

20683276|a|An immunocompromised man presented with an inflammatory eyelid lesion. Biopsy was performed; histopathology and special staining confirmed a diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis. The man was treated with oral erythromycin, and the lesion resolved. The etiologic agents of bacillary angiomatosis are Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana, Gram-negative coccobacilli. The organisms stain positively with the Warthin-Starry silver stain. Lesions can be cutaneous or visceral and have been commonly described in immunocompromised patients. Histopathologic examination of lesions reveals angiogenesis and cellular proliferation. Bacillary angiomatosis can be treated with oral antibiotics.

22150819|t|A pilot randomised controlled trial of brief versus twice weekly versus standard supervised consumption in patients on opiate maintenance treatment.
22150819|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Methadone maintenance remains the mainstay of treatment for opiate dependence in Scotland. Guidelines recommend supervised self-administration for at least 3 months, yet this is often interpreted as long-term supervision. However, there is no evidence base for deciding the optimal period of supervision. We tested the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of different supervision models. DESIGN AND METHODS: Three armed pilot RCT, set in three Scottish treatment areas, recruited opiate-dependent patients who had received methadone treatment for 3 months. Participants were randomised to: (i) no supervision; (ii) twice weekly supervision; or (iii) daily supervision for further 3 months. As a pilot, key process measures were: recruitment rates, follow-up rates and treatment fidelity. We also wanted to estimate effect sizes of two co-primary outcomes for a full RCT: treatment retention and illicit heroin use. The recruitment target was 60 participants. RESULTS: One hundred and two eligible patients were identified, 60 (59%) participated, and 46 followed up (77%). Study fidelity was good with two participants moving group. Those randomised to no supervision were significantly happier with their group allocation. No significant differences were found in primary outcomes, although retention decreased with increased supervision, while illicit heroin use was least in those most supervised. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to recruit and randomise participants to an RCT comparing different forms of supervised consumption. Pilot data suggest increased supervision may reduce illicit heroin use, but may decrease retention. This should now be tested in a large-scale multicentre RCT.

18197554|t|Ketoconazole and the modulation of multidrug resistance-mediated transport in Caco-2 and MDCKII-MDR1 drug transport models.
18197554|a|The hypothesis tested was that ketoconazole can modulate P-glycoprotein, thereby altering cellular uptake and apparent permeability (P(app)) of multidrug-resistant substrates, such as cyclosporin A (CSA) and digoxin, across Caco-2, MDCKII-MDR1, and MDCKII wild-type cell transport models. (3)H-CSA/(3)H-digoxin transport experiments were performed with and without co-exposure to ketoconazole, and (3)H-ketoconzole transport experiments were performed with and without co-exposure to dietary flavonoids, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and xanthohumol. Ketoconazole (3 microM) reduced the P(app) efflux of CSA and digoxin from 5.07 x 10(-6) to 2.91 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) and from 2.60 x 10(-6) to 1.41 x 10(-6) cm s(-1), respectively, in Caco-2 cells. In the MDCKII-MDR1 cells, ketoconazole reduced the P(app) efflux of CSA and increased the P(app) absorption of digoxin. Cellular uptake of ketoconazole in the Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited by CSA and digoxin, whereas epigallocatechin-3-gallate and xanthohumol exhibited biphasic responses. In conclusion, ketoconazole modulates the P(app) of P-glycoprotein substrates by interacting with MDR1 protein. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and xanthohumol modulate the transport and uptake of ketoconazole.

10416130|t|Increased cortisol levels in human umbilical cord blood inhibit interferon alpha production of neonates.
10416130|a|Immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are generally known, but the mechanisms influencing the immune system are poorly understood. However, a correlation between cortisol levels and cytokine production has been reported by several investigators. In the present study we determined cortisol concentrations in human umbilical cord blood. Cord blood samples from healthy and normal term infants born by vaginal delivery and blood samples from healthy adult donors, respectively, were analysed. Our data revealed significantly increased cortisol levels in cord blood. In contrast, samples derived from infants born by caesarian section seem to be normal. Further experiments were performed to analyse the influence of cortisol on the production of interferon (IFN) alpha. Therefore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from peripheral blood of healthy adult volunteers. Cortisol was added to a final concentration of 30 micrograms/dl as measured in cord blood. Following stimulation with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) the IFN-alpha release was 50 to 60% reduced compared to untreated controls. These data suggest that increased levels of cortisol in cord blood might influence the IFN-alpha response of newborns. We propose that cortisol levels increase transiently after birth and may alter several physiological as well as immunological reactions. Since cord blood is commonly used to investigate features of the neonatal immune system, different behaviour as a result of temporarily increased cortisol concentrations should be considered.

18559275|t|Broad modulation of neuropathic pain states by a selective estrogen receptor beta agonist.
18559275|a|The effects of estrogens on pain perception remain controversial. In animal models, both beneficial and detrimental effects of non-selective estrogens have been reported. ERb-131 a non-steroidal estrogen receptor beta ligand was evaluated in several pain animal models involving nerve injury or sensitization. Using functional and binding assays, ERb-131 was characterized as a potent and selective estrogen receptor beta agonist. In vivo, ERb-131 was devoid of estrogen receptor alpha activity as assessed in a rat uterotrophic assay. ERb-131 alleviated tactile hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin, and reversed tactile allodynia caused by spinal nerve ligation and various chemical insults. Moreover, ERb-131 did not influence the pain threshold of normal healthy animals. Thus, estrogen receptor beta agonism is a critical effector in attenuating a broad range of anti-nociceptive states.

8358057|t|Update of hormonal treatment in cancer of the prostate.
8358057|a|Prostate carcinomas are heterogeneous tumors composed of hormone sensitive and hormone insensitive cells. Although all androgens have an effect on prostatic cells, it is believed that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the active metabolite primarily utilized by prostatic cancer cells for growth and division. Hormonal therapies are therefore designed to lower tissue levels of DHT or prevent its binding to receptors on prostatic cancer cells. The Veterans Administration Cooperative studies in the 1960s and 1970s laid the groundwork for the use and timing of hormonal therapy. Until recently orchiectomy and estrogens were the two main alternatives, but new compounds such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs and antiandrogens have shown to be as effective and less toxic than estrogens. Today, important controversies concerning the selection of the best primary treatment and the timing of initiating the hormonal therapy still exist. Second line hormonal strategies are used, but they still have to prove their impact on overall survival.

23758078|t|Use of telemedicine to improve glycemic management in a skilled nursing facility: a pilot study.
23758078|a|The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using telemedicine to improve glycemic control (reduce episodes of hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia) for residents with diabetes in a skilled nursing facility. This randomized pilot study enrolled residents with diabetes (n=23; mean age, 83 years; 91% insulin-treated) and compared usual care (control; n=11) with usual care plus weekly/biweekly teleconsultations with an endocrinologist (n=12) for up to 6 months. A nurse and dietitian from the skilled nursing facility were at all televisits. Residents who were able and willing attended the televisits. Family members were also invited and occasionally were present. The endocrinologist reviewed glucose levels from point-of-care glucose meter downloads, dietary intake, medications, and medical status and recommended changes in glycemic therapy as needed. Measurements included glucose levels from point-of-care glucose meter downloads, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels, and a nurse satisfaction survey. Results showed that 7 of 10 insulin-treated intervention subjects had basal doses reduced (18-69%) compared with 2 of 11 control subjects (reduced 10% and 25%, respectively). There was a decrease in percentage of intervention participants with episodes of hypoglycemia (<80   mg/dL) over the previous month from baseline (42%) to end of study (22%) versus a rise in the control group (from 36% to 45%) and less hyperglycemia (>400   mg/dL) (intervention, from 33% to 22%; control, from 22% to 55%). There were no end-of-study A1c values >8.0% in the intervention group versus 44% in controls. Nursing staff at the skilled nursing facility expressed high satisfaction. Results suggest that telemedicine diabetes consultations to skilled nursing facilities can improve glycemic management.

1762345|t|Erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase measurements in Balkan endemic nephropathy.
1762345|a|Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic progressive kidney disease leading to renal insufficiency. The possible etiological role of some toxic factors was considered in this study by investigating the activity of erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D), an enzyme influenced by various environmental factors. We observed that ALA-D activity was markedly decreased in patients with BEN and in 32% of their healthy family members. Glutathione concentration was found normal in all the groups studied, however, it was possible to reactivate the enzyme in vitro by addition of exogenous glutathione. Percent activation was significantly higher in the groups with decreased ALA-D activity. Blood lead levels were within normal range. The results suggest a normal synthesis of ALA-D apoenzyme, and also the presence of some factors, environmental, metabolic, or genetic, which may affect the enzyme activity through binding to the reactive groups in the active center of this enzyme or by oxidation of the reactive groups. Additional studies are necessary to further elucidate the significance of decreased ALA-D activity in BEN and their healthy relatives.

15186711|t|Strategies for coping with fatigue among HIV-positive individuals fifty years and older.
15186711|a|Fatigue, a common symptom among persons living with HIV/AIDS, is often underreported and undertreated. However, given fatigue's pervasive effects on well-being and functioning, the identification of its physiologic and psychological causes and strategies to alleviate it are important to patients' quality of life. As part of a study to understand better how HIV-positive middle-aged and older adults (50+) manage common symptoms, 49 participants discussed in depth their experience with fatigue. Most engaged in both self-care activities and sought the assistance of a health care professional. Frequent strategies included dietary changes, vitamins, modification of routines, rest, exercise, and prescribed medications for anemia, Vitamin B(12) deficiency, or testosterone deficiency. Complementary and alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, massage, herbal remedies, special juices) was also commonly used. Participants often used multiple strategies to alleviate their fatigue, possibly because of their tendency to attribute it to multiple causes. These HIV-positive older adults were also apt to view fatigue as an indirect indicator of their overall health status and immune functioning. This may explain why many of the coping strategies they used could be considered approaches to improving their overall health status as a means to increasing their energy levels. Health care professionals can play an important role in helping HIV-positive individuals manage their fatigue. The majority of participants tried to implement the coping suggestions offered by health care professionals, as well as those from family, friends, and support group members.

20230883|t|Ternary nanoparticles of anionic lipid nanoparticles/protamine/DNA for gene delivery.
20230883|a|In this study, the lipid nanoparticles with excellent cellular uptake capacity were utilized to prepare lipid nanoparticles/protamine/DNA ternary nanoparticles for gene delivery. Anionic lipid nanoparticles consisting of monostearin (MS) and different content of oleic acid (OA) were prepared. The lipid nanoparticles had an average size ranging from 23.6 to 71.3 nm and a zeta potential about -30 mV. The protamine/DNA complex was prepared by mixing the DNA and protamine solution with 1:2 mass ratio. The average size of protamine/DNA complex was 128.5 nm and with 19.4 mV zeta potential. Lipid nanoparticles/protamine/DNA ternary nanoparticles were then prepared by combining the protamine/DNA binary complex with lipid nanoparticles. The ternary nanoparticles had an average size ranging from 192.7 to 260.6 nm and were negatively charged. Gene transfection efficiency was improved by increasing OA content in lipid nanoparticles. Results of cellular uptake showed that the uptake ability of lipid nanoparticles was enhanced by increasing the OA content. Lipid nanoparticles with 20 wt% OA/protamine/DNA ternary nanoparticles (w/w/w, 65:6:3) showed the best and the most durable gene transfection even in the presence of serum.

22242916|t|Qualitative and quantitative analysis of tumor cell metabolism via stable isotope labeling assisted microfluidic chip electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
22242916|a|In this work, a stable isotope labeling assisted microfluidic chip electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SIL-chip-ESI-MS) platform for qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell metabolism was developed. Microfluidic cell culture, drug-induced cell apoptosis analysis, and cell metabolism measurements were performed simultaneously on the specifically designed device. MCF-7 cells were cultivated in vitro and exposed in anticancer agent (genistein and genistein-d(2)) for cell-based drug assay. A dual-isotopic labeling was presented for effective qualitative analysis of multiplex metabolites. Interestingly, three coeluting pairs of isotopomers appeared with an m/z difference of two. Despite complex biological matrixes, they can be easily recognized and identified by chip-ESI-MS/MS, which significantly facilitates candidate biomarker discovery. The quantitative performance of this system was evaluated using genistein as a model drug by means of stable isotope dilution analysis. The linear equation obtained is y = 0.06x - 3.38 × 10(-3) (R(2) = 0.995) at the dynamic range from 0.5 to 40 µM. The detection limit is 0.2 µM. The method shows an excellent stability of 2.2% relative standard deviation (RSD) and a good repeatability of 5.5% RSD. Our results have successfully demonstrated the capability of selective and quantitative analysis of cell-based drug absorption and metabolites with high stability, sensitivity, and repeatability on the chip-ESI-MS system. Consequently, the present device shows promise as a high-throughput, low-cost, and online platform for cell metabolism studies and drug screening processes.

17323187|t|Pharmacological profile of ramosetron, a novel therapeutic agent for IBS.
17323187|a|Ramosetron is a potent and selective serotonin (5-HT)(3) receptor antagonist that has been shown to affect abnormal colonic function and abdominal pain in animals. Ramosetron (0.3 to 100 microg/kg, p.o.) has been found to significantly suppress abnormal defecation induced by conditioned-fear stress (CFS), restraint stress, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and 5-HT in rats and mice, and these effects were more potent than those of alosetron, cilansetron or loperamide. On the other hand, ramosetron (3,000 microg/kg, p. o., once daily for 7 days) did not inhibit normal defecation in dogs while tiquizium significantly inhibited it. Ramosetron (3 to 100 microg/kg, p. o.) also significantly prevented CFS-induced acceleration of colonic transit and CRF-induced abnormal water transport in rats, respectively. Moreover, ramosetron (0.3 to 3 microg/kg, p. o.) significantly suppressed restraint stress-induced decrease in colonic pain threshold, an effect not observed with loperamide. These results indicate that ramosetron produce beneficial clinical effects on IBS symptoms.

22151787|t|Endophthalmitis following cataract surgery: the role of prophylactic postoperative chloramphenicol eye drops.
22151787|a|PURPOSE: The main aim of the study was to assess whether omitting prophylactic postoperative topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol) influenced the risk of developing endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including all patients who had cataract surgery at our outpatient cataract unit between 2004 and 2011. Postoperative topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol) were omitted from 2007 onwards, as was the first postoperative day review. Patients with a diagnosis of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery were extracted, and the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis (PE) before and after changing these routines was compared. The diagnosis of PE was defined as severe intraocular inflammation requiring prompt vitreous sampling for culture. RESULTS: Seven thousand one hundred and twenty-three and 8131 cataract surgeries were performed in the following periods: January 2004 through December 2006 (period 1) and January 2007 through December 2010 (period 2), respectively. Five cases of PE were identified in period 1 (0.070%) and four patients in period 2 (0.049%). The median time between cataract surgery and onset of symptoms was 6 days in period 1 and 4.5 days in period 2. Median time for intervention was 7 and 5 days postsurgery, respectively. CONCLUSION: We found no difference in the frequency of PE following cataract surgery when changing the postoperative topical medication from a mixture of corticosteroids and antibiotics to only corticosteroids.

12044126|t|Mechanism of cocaine-induced hyperthermia in humans.
12044126|a|BACKGROUND: The lethal effects of cocaine are unique among those of other illicit drugs because cocaine has the propensity to cause hyperthermia. The traditional view is that cocaine causes a hypermetabolic state with increased heat production. However, because cocaine-induced hyperthermia occurs primarily in hot weather, it is hypothesized that cocaine also impairs thermoregulatory adjustments that mediate heat dissipation. OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of cocaine on body temperature regulation in humans. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. SETTING: A cardiovascular physiology laboratory in Dallas, Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 7 healthy, cocaine-naive volunteers. INTERVENTION: Progressive passive heat stress, during which each participant received intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo (lidocaine, 2 mg/kg). MEASUREMENTS: Esophageal temperature, skin blood flow, sweat rate, and perceived thermal sensation. RESULTS: Three major new findings were noted. First, cocaine substantially augmented the progressive increase in esophageal temperature during heat stress (P < 0.001). Second, this augmentation was explained by a rightward shift in the esophageal temperature threshold for the onset of both cutaneous vasodilation (37.37 +/- 0.09 degrees C for cocaine vs. 37.06 +/- 0.07 degrees C for lidocaine; P = 0.01) and sweating (37.38 +/- 0.09 degrees C for cocaine vs. 37.07 +/- 0.06 degrees C for lidocaine; P = 0.002). Third, cocaine paradoxically impaired the perception of heating by attenuating the progressive increase in thermal discomfort associated with heat stress. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, impaired heat dissipation is a major mechanism by which cocaine elevates body temperature. When healthy, cocaine-naive persons are subjected to passive heating, pretreatment with even a small dose of intranasal cocaine impairs sweating and cutaneous vasodilation (the major autonomic adjustments to thermal stress) and heat perception (the key trigger for behavioral adjustments).

17275646|t|Pseudogout after total knee arthroplasty.
17275646|a|We report a case of a patient who presented with signs and symptoms of acute septic arthritis of the knee 9 years after total knee arthroplasty. Thick white purulent fluid was aspirated from the knee. Microscopy of the fluid demonstrated calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, and no organisms were cultured. The patient made a rapid recovery after the single aspiration, rest, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs alone. Eight years after this episode, the patient remains asymptomatic. To the best of our knowledge, no case of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate arthropathy after total knee arthroplasty has been reported previously.

25599329|t|Out-of-hospital mortality among patients receiving methadone for noncancer pain.
25599329|a|IMPORTANCE: Growing methadone use in pain management has raised concerns regarding its safety relative to other long-acting opioids. Methadone hydrochloride may increase the risk for lethal respiratory depression related to accidental overdose and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of out-of-hospital death in patients receiving methadone for noncancer pain with that in comparable patients receiving sustained-release (SR) morphine sulfate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Tennessee Medicaid records from 1997 through 2009. The cohort included patients receiving morphine SR or methadone who were aged 30 to 74 years, did not have cancer or another life-threatening illness, and were not in a hospital or nursing home. At cohort entry, 32   742 and 6014 patients had filled a prescription for morphine SR or methadone, respectively. The patients' median age was 48 years, 57.9% were female, and comparable proportions had received cardiovascular, psychotropic, and other musculoskeletal medications. Nearly 90% of the patients received the opioid for back pain or other musculoskeletal pain. The median doses prescribed for morphine SR and methadone were 90 mg/d and 40 mg/d, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study end point was out-of-hospital mortality, given that opioid-related deaths typically occur outside the hospital. RESULTS: There were 477 deaths during 28   699 person-years of follow-up (ie, 166 deaths per 10   000 person-years). After control for study covariates, patients receiving methadone had a 46% increased risk of death during the follow-up period, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.17-1.83; P   <   .001), resulting in 72 (95% CI, 27-130) excess deaths per 10   000 person-years of follow-up. Methadone doses of 20 mg/d or less, the lowest dose quartile, were associated with an increased risk of death (HR,   1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51, P   =   .046) relative to a comparable dose of morphine SR (<60 mg/d). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The increased risk of death observed for patients receiving methadone in this retrospective cohort study, even for low doses, supports recommendations that it should not be a drug of first choice for noncancer pain.

7749392|t|Kinins in the pathogenesis of human airway diseases.
7749392|a|1. Over the past decade, data have been obtained showing that the potent vasoactive peptides known as kinins are generated in airway secretions during a variety of inflammatory airway diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, viral rhinitis and asthma. Kinin generation involves release of tissue kallikrein from airway glands, as well as increased vascular permeability and activation of the plasma kallikrein system. The activity of generated kinins is regulated by a number of cell-associated, as well as plasma-derived, peptidases. 2. Kinins can induce relevant symptoms when applied to the surface of human airways. Moreover, the effects of kinins are more pronounced in the setting of chronic inflammation. In the upper airways, kinins can stimulate glandular secretion, increase vascular permeability and stimulate sensory nerves to produce symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and nasal and throat irritation. In the lower airways of asthmatics, kinins are potent inducers of edema and cause bronchoconstriction by a mechanism that involves, at least in part, neural reflexes. 3. Definitive proof of a role for kinins in human airway diseases has been difficult to obtain because receptor antagonists that have been available to date have suffered from problems of potency or duration of action. Studies are continuing, however, to understand the mechanisms by which kinins exert their effects and to delineate their importance in airway diseases.

17437871|t|In vitro activity of amoxicillin, clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin against oral Actinomyces.
17437871|a|Actinomyces spp have been increasingly associated with endodontic infections. However, the antimicrobial susceptibility of this genus has not been studied extensively. The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility of oral isolates of Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces viscosus, and Actinomyces odontolyticus to amoxicillin, clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin using in vitro assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each bacterial isolate was determined by using E-test strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The MIC(90) was 0.19 microg/mL for amoxicillin, 0.25 microg/mL for doxycycline, 0.50 microg/mL for moxifloxacin, and 1.00 microg/mL for clindamycin. However, metronidazole was not active against any of the Actinomyces spp tested (MIC(90)>256 microg/mL).

18537712|t|Saponins in tumor therapy.
18537712|a|Saponins are plant glycosides with favorable anti-tumorigenic properties. Several saponins inhibit tumor cell growth by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with IC50 values of up to 0.2 microM. We discuss diverse groups of saponins (dioscins, saikosaponins, julibrosides, soy saponins, ginseng saponins and avicins) investigated in relation to tumor therapy and focus on cellular and systemic mechanisms of tumor cell growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. The review also describes saponins in combination with conventional tumor treatment strategies, which result in improved therapeutic success. Some combinations of saponins and anti-tumorigenic drugs induce synergistic effects with potentiated growth inhibition.

22118173|t|Outcomes of reintroducing anti-tuberculosis drugs following cutaneous adverse drug reactions.
22118173|a|BACKGROUND: Data regarding outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) are limited. The re-introduction of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs after CADR is controversial and management poorly defined. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 298 patients with CADR admitted to a tertiary dermatology ward in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: TB-associated CADR was diagnosed in 65 of 298 patients. Of these, 60/65 (92%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected (median CD4 count 107 cells/mm (3)). Anti-tuberculosis drugs were reintroduced in 46/65 (71%) patients, of whom 23/46 (50%) developed re-introduction reactions. The most frequent re-introduction reactions were itch in 11/23 (48%) and hepatitis in 9/23 (39%) patients. Of the 23 re-introduction reactions, 13 (57%) were mild, six (26%) moderate and four (26%) severe. Among those with reintroduction reactions, rifampicin (RMP) was the offending drug in 13/23 (57%), isoniazid in 5/23(22%), pyrazinamide in 3/23 (13%), and ethambutol, streptomycin and ofloxacin each in 1/23 (4%) cases. Lack of previous TB treatment and re-challenge with RMP were independently associated with the likelihood of reintroduction reactions. CONCLUSIONS: In this high TB burden setting, although re-introduction reactions are common, the majority are non-life-threatening. All first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs can cause CADR, and RMP is more commonly implicated than previously reported. These data guide the management of anti-tuberculosis drug-associated CADR in high HIV prevalence settings.

14651160|t|Possible application of milk oligosaccharides for drug development.
14651160|a|By applying a finger-printing method to the analysis of human milk oligosaccharides, several oligosacchartides were found to be deleted in the milk of non-secretor or Lewis negative individual. This finding afforded a clue to elucidate the enzymatic basis of blood types in humans. Furthermore, disappearance of some major oligosaccharides led to the finding of five novel minor oligosaccharides, which were hidden under the major oligosaccharides. Later on, structures of more than seventy oligosaccharides were elucidated. These oligosaccharides are derived from eleven core oligosaccharides by sialylation and/or fucosylation. All these oligosaccharides contain lactose at their reducing termini. This evidence, together with the deletion phenomena found in the milk of two blood type individuals, suggested that the oligosaccharides are formed by the concerted action of glycosyltransferases, which are responsible for formation of the sugar chains of glycoproteins on the surface of epithelial cells constructing the mucous membrane. The elongation may start by the action of iGnT. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of a beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue to the C-3 position of the galactose moiety constructing the N-acetyllactosamine group of the sugar chains of glycoconjugates. Therefore, oligosaccharides in human milk may include many structures, starting from the N-acetyllactosamine residues in the sugar chains of various glycoproteins. Many evidences, which indicate that virulent enteric bacteria and viruses start their infection by binding to particular sugar chains of glycoconjugates on the surface of their target cells, were presented recently. Therefore, milk oligosaccharides are expected to be useful to inhibit the infection of these bacteria and viruses.

11454557|t|Contrasting effects of phentolamine and nitroprusside on neural and cardiovascular variability.
11454557|a|The relative contributions of a central neural oscillator and of the delay in alpha-adrenergic transmission within the baroreflex loop in the predominance of low-frequency (LF) cardiovascular variability during sympathetic activation in humans are unclear. We measured R-R interval (RR), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure (BP), and their variability in 10 normal subjects during sympathetic activation achieved by BP lowering with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and alpha-adrenergic blockade using phentolamine. SNP and phentolamine induced comparable reductions in BP (P > 0.25). Despite tachycardia and sympathetic activation with both SNP and phentolamine, LF variability in RR, MSNA, and BP increased during SNP and decreased during phentolamine (SNP: RR +20 +/- 6%, MSNA +3 +/- 5%, systolic BP +9 +/- 6%, diastolic BP +7 +/- 5%; phentolamine: RR -2 +/- 7%, MSNA -34 +/- 6%, systolic BP -16 +/- 8%, diastolic BP -13 +/- 4%, P < 0.05 except systolic BP, where P = 0.09). Thus LF variability is reduced when sympathetic activation is induced by alpha-adrenergic blockade. This suggests that alpha-adrenergic transmission within the baroreflex loop may contribute importantly to the predominance of LF cardiovascular variability associated with sympathetic excitation in humans.

1646997|t|[Des-Met14]bombesin analogues function as small cell lung cancer bombesin receptor antagonists.
1646997|a|A series of bombesin (BN) analogues lacking the C-terminal methionine at the 14 position were evaluated as BN receptor antagonists. [D-Phe6]BN(6-13)amide inhibited specific 125I-GRP binding to lung cancer cell line NCI-H720 with an IC50 value of 12 nM. In contrast, [D-Phe6]BN(6-13)propylamide, butylamide and methylester were more potent with IC50 values of 3, 5 and 5 nM whereas [D-Phe6,Sta13]BN(6-13)amide was less potent with an IC50 value of 180 nM. [D-Phe6]BN(6-13)propylamide antagonized the ability of BN to elevate cytosolic Ca2+, whereas [D-Phe6]BN(6-13)butylamide was a partial agonist. In a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) growth assay, [D-Phe6]BN(6-13)propylamide inhibited colony formation. In summary, BN analogues which lack a C-terminal methionine may function as useful SCLC BN receptor antagonists.

12723258|t|Antibiotic susceptibility and serotype distribution of 240 Streptococcus pneumoniae causing meningitis in Belgium 1997-2000.
12723258|a|Cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, collected during the years 1997-2000 at more than 100 Belgian laboratories were studied. The 10 most common serotypes-serogroups representing 76% of the isolates were 14, 6, 9, 19, 23, 18, 4, 10, 8 and 12 (in order of frequency). Thirty-six percent of strains were isolated in children < 5 years old. In this age group the number of serogroups was more limited and 81.4% are included in the 7-valent conjugate vaccine. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin was observed in 13.9% of 237 strains (MIC > 0.06 mg/L), with only 2.1% resistant strains (MIC > 1 mg/L). Twelve strains showed reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (MIC > 0.5 mg/L). Only three of the 237 strains were intermediately susceptible to meropenem. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and moxifloxacin. In Belgium, high doses of third generation cephalosporins remain effective for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. The new fluoroquinolones seem the most promising agents for the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis in the future.

15120860|t|Central cholinergic functions in human amyloid precursor protein knock-in/presenilin-1 transgenic mice.
15120860|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid peptide formation and deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, central cholinergic dysfunction, and dementia; however, the relationship between these parameters is not well understood. We studied the effect of amyloid peptide formation and deposition on central cholinergic function in knock-in mice carrying the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene with the Swedish/London double mutation (APP-SL mice) which were crossbred with transgenic mice overexpressing normal (PS1wt) or mutated (M146L; PS1mut) human presenilin-1. APP-SLxPS1mut mice had increased levels of Abeta peptides at 10 months of age and amyloid plaques at 14 months of age while APP-SLxPS1wt mice did not have increased peptide levels and did not develop amyloid plaques. We used microdialysis in 15-27 months old mice to compare hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the two mouse lines and found that extracellular ACh levels were slightly but significantly reduced in the APP-SLxPS1mut mice (-26%; P=0.044). Exploratory activity in the open field increased hippocampal ACh release by two-fold in both mouse lines; total and relative increases were not significantly different for the two strains under study. Similarly, infusion of scopolamine (1 microM) increased hippocampal ACh release to a similar extent (3-5-fold) in both groups. High-affinity choline uptake, a measure of the ACh turnover rate, was identical in both mouse lines. Neurons expressing choline acetyltransferase were increased in the septum of APP-SLxPS1mut mice (+26%; P=0.046). We conclude that amyloid peptide production causes a small decrease of extracellular ACh levels. The deposition of amyloid plaques, however, does not impair stimulated ACh release and proceeds without major changes of central cholinergic function.

17130156|t|Use of thermolytic protective groups to prevent G-tetrad formation in CpG ODN type D: structural studies and immunomodulatory activity in primates.
17130156|a|CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) show promise as immunoprotective agents and vaccine adjuvants. CpG ODN type D were shown to improve clinical outcome in rhesus macaques challenged with Leishmania major. These ODN have a self-complementary core sequence and a 3' end poly(G) track that favors G-tetrad formation leading to multimerization. Although multimerization appears necessary for localization to early endosomes and signaling via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), it can result in product polymorphisms, aggregation and precipitation, thereby hampering their clinical applications. This study shows that functionalizing the poly(G) track of D ODN with thermolytic 2-(N-formyl-N-methyl)aminoethyl (fma) phosphate/thiophosphate protecting groups (pro-D ODN) reduces G-tetrad formation in solution, while allowing tetrad formation inside the cell where the potassium concentration is higher. Temperature-dependent cleavage of the fma groups over time further promoted formation of stable G-tetrads. Peripheral blood cells internalized pro-D ODN efficiently, inducing high levels of IFNalpha, IL-6, IFNgamma and IP-10 and triggering dendritic cell maturation. Administration of pro-D35 to macaques challenged with L.major significantly increased the number of antigen-specific IFNgamma-secreting PBMC and reduced the severity of the skin lesions demonstrating immunoprotective activity of pro-D ODN in vivo. This technology fosters the development of more efficient immunotherapeutic oligonucleotide formulations for the treatment of allergies, cancer and infectious diseases.

12763471|t|Seizures and therapy in adolescents with uncomplicated epilepsy.
12763471|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe seizures and their therapy among Swedish adolescents, aged 13-22, with active but uncomplicated epilepsy. METHOD: The adolescents answered questionnaires (158/193). Data were also obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Epileptic seizure types could be specified in 92.1% of the cases. Predominant types were Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures and Partial Complex Seizures with Secondary Generalisation. Clinical diagnoses by physicians were unspecified in 25.8%. Ninety percent were on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), most commonly valproate and carbamazepine. New AEDs were used in 9.3% of the cases and polytherapy in 13.9%. More than 40% of the respondents had seizures despite AED treatment. Side effects of AEDs were experienced by 61%, most commonly tiredness, concentration difficulties and headache. Patients on polytherapy experienced significantly more side effects. The choice of a new AED over a traditional one was not related to seizure type or seizure control. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents had persistent seizures despite treatment at a specialist regional epilepsy centre. This, plus the high reported rate of side effects of AED treatment, suggests that treatment is not optimal for the group studied. As traditional AEDs strongly dominated treatment possibly newly marketed AEDs are underused in this group.

9373794|t|Effect of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate on tumor necrosis factor-alpha release in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
9373794|a|The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We also evaluated the effects of high-dose MPA on hematological parameters (leukocyte, neutrophil, platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit) and side effects of MPA. One week following the first cycle chemotherapy, 20 patients who developed neutropenia were enrolled in the study. One gram/day MPA was administered orally to the patients and was continued from one week following the first chemotherapy cycle to one week after the second chemotherapy cycle. The patients received the second chemotherapy cycle at the same dosages as the first cycle. Before MPA treatment TNF-alpha levels were lower than post-treatment levels, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The differences in the mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts before and after the high-dose MPA treatment were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

15925771|t|Increased circulating T cell reactivity to GM1 ganglioside in patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.
15925771|a|This study was performed to determine whether increased ganglioside-specific T cell reactivity can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). T cell responsiveness to the gangliosides GM1, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GT1b, GQ1b and sulphatide was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated GBS patients (57), CIDP patients (43), patients with other peripheral neuropathies (55) and healthy control subjects (74) in a standard 6-day proliferation assay. Increased T cell reactivity to GM1 occurred in GBS patients compared to healthy controls and patients with other neuropathies. There was increased reactivity to GM3 in GBS patients compared to patients with other neuropathies but not compared to healthy controls. The frequencies of increased T cell reactivity to GM1 and GM3 in CIDP patients were intermediate between those of GBS patients and controls. We suggest that T cell reactivity to gangliosides might play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of GBS and perhaps CIDP.

12905442|t|Volumetric and histologic responses to radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy of metastatic cervical lymph nodes of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
12905442|a|PURPOSE: The relationship between the volumetric and histologic responses of metastatic cervical nodes to radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the oral and maxillofacial region is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the correlation between the initial volume and regression rate of metastatic nodes with their histologic response to preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The volume of 54 metastatic nodes in 32 patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the oral and maxillofacial region was measured by ultrasonography before and after preoperative therapy, and the rate of the volume change was calculated. All surgically removed nodes were histologically classified as poor, good, or complete response according to their histologic features. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in initial volume among the 3 response groups. Good and complete response nodes showed a significant increase in regression rate compared with poor response nodes. All 11 nodes showing no regression were poor response nodes, and 7 with a regression rate of more than 90% were good or complete response nodes. The remaining 36 nodes (regression rate, 0% to 90%) represented all 3 types of histologic response. Of these, 7 of 9 complete response nodes were found in 5 patients who received combination chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS: The initial nodal volume before therapy is not a good indicator for the response to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. A regression rate of more than 90% may be a useful predictor of the effectiveness of preoperative treatments, but it was difficult to define the cutoff values in regression rates for differentiating types of histologic response.

7597269|t|The incidence of airflow obstruction in bronchial carcinoma, its relation to breathlessness, and response to bronchodilator therapy.
7597269|a|Breathlessness is a common symptom in patients with primary bronchial carcinoma and is often not well-controlled. Most patients are ex- or current smokers, and therefore are at high risk for co-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The incidence of airflow obstruction in patients with bronchial carcinoma, its relation to breathlessness, and response to bronchodilator therapy was examined prospectively. Fifty-seven consecutive patients attending our outpatient clinic with bronchial carcinoma diagnosed in the preceding 12 months were studied (22 female, 35 male, mean age 68.4 years). Spirometry was performed and breathlessness rated. Those with airflow obstruction (FEV1:FVC < 65% and FEV1 < 70% predicted) and who judged themselves to have moderate or severe breathlessness, were offered a trial of bronchodilator therapy. The response to regular inhaled fenoterol and ipratropium bromide by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and large volume spacer, and to regular nebulized salbutamol and ipratropium bromide was assessed by home peak flow recordings, spirometry and two subjective scores: (a) rating of breathlessness on a simple four-point scale, and (b) activity score of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. There was very strong association between airflow obstruction and breathlessness. Twenty-eight patients (49%) had airflow obstruction, and we had breathlessness ratings on 26 of these patients of whom 18 (69%) had rated it as moderate or severe. Only four of the patients with airflow obstruction and breathlessness were using bronchodilator therapy. There was no significant difference in the mean age, time from diagnosis, tumour site, or smoking history between the groups with, and without, airflow obstruction. There was no association between cell type and the presence of airflow obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

19127247|t|Pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
19127247|a|Seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (PA); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of PA were the most active compounds, displaying MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 microg mL(-1). Thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. Furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.

18941456|t|Abundant Fas expression by gastrointestinal stromal tumours may serve as a therapeutic target for MegaFasL.
18941456|a|Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has been shown to be an active agent in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), complete remissions are almost never seen and most patients finally experience disease progression during their course of treatment. An alternative therapeutic option is to target death receptors such as Fas. We showed that a panel of imatinib-sensitive (GIST882) and imatinib-resistant (GIST48, GIST430 and GIST430K-) cell lines expressed Fas. MegaFasL, a recently developed hexameric form of soluble Fas ligand (FasL), appeared to be an active apoptosis-inducing agent in these cell lines. Moreover, MegaFasL potentiated the apoptotic effects of imatinib. Immunohistochemical evaluations, in 45 primary GISTs, underscored the relevance of the Fas pathway: Fas was expressed in all GISTs and was expressed strongly in 93%, whereas FasL was expressed at moderate and strong levels in 35 and 53% of GISTs, respectively. Fas and FasL expression were positively correlated in these primary GISTs, but there was no association between Fas or FasL expression and primary site, histological subtype, tumour size, mitotic index, risk classification, and KIT mutation status. The abundant immunohistochemical Fas and FasL expression were corroborated by western blot analysis. In conclusion, our data implicate Fas as a potential therapeutic target in GIST.

9348582|t|UFT in gastric cancer: current status and future developments.
9348582|a|Despite recent progress in surgery and chemotherapy, advanced gastric cancer carries a poor prognosis. Although several antitumor agents have some clinical activity, responses are usually of short duration and fail to improve survival. Combination chemotherapy regimens containing fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (Platinol) frequently result in higher response rates, but fail to significantly alter the ultimate course of the disease. Tegafur and uracil (UFT) have been extensively studied in gastric cancer in Japan. In responding patients, single-agent therapy results in a 1-year survival of 47%. Studies using combination regimens with UFT are currently performed in Europe, and data from Japan demonstrate that UFT can be safely combined with a variety of other agents. However, the exact contribution of UFT in these combinations will need to be evaluated further. The present review summarizes the use of UFT alone or in combination, as well as in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer.

10587478|t|N-acetylcysteine and ambroxol inhibit endotoxin-induced phagocyte accumulation in rat lungs.
10587478|a|We have investigated whether pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and/or ambroxol (Amb), drugs known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, would minimize lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced leucocyte accumulation in rat lung microvasculature and protect lungs from damage and the effect of these drugs on chemotactic peptide (fMLP)-induced chemiluminescence of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Animals were injected ip with NAC (27.6 mg/kg, n=8), ambroxol (70 mg/kg, n=8), combination NAC+ambroxol (n=8), or 1 ml buffer alone (n=8), once a day for 3 consecutive days. Then animals were injected with LPS (17 mg/kg), and killed 3 h later. In each of another four groups eight rats were used as a control, and received the same drug treatment but LPS was replaced with 0.9% NaCl. PMNs and macrophages (Ms) were counted in histologic slides of lung tissue. Using computer image analysis we measured the area of alveolar profiles. Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in PMNs suspensions obtained from healthy volunteers. Chemiluminescence intensity was measured in resting and fMLP-stimulated cells, and compared between cells incubated with Amb, NAC or distilled water. We observed significant differences in the number of PMNs and Ms, alveolar profile area between control and LPS-treated animals (P<0.01). PMNs and Ms were numerous in lungs of LPS-administered animals (PMNs: Median (M)=137.5 per 6 high power fields range (r)=54.0; Ms: M=123.0 r=11.0), less numerous in ambroxol-treated group (PMNs: M=101.5 r=32.0 and Ms:53.5 r=36.0), not abundant in NAC (PMNs:M=56.0 r=28.0 and Ms:M=20.5 r=13.0) and in NAC+ambroxol treated rats (PMNs:M=53.5 r=21.0 and Ms:M=29.0 r=9.0), and rare in LPS+drugs-untreated control group (PMNs:M=40.5 r=19.0 and Ms:M=18.5 r=15.0). Chemiluminescence assay revealed that 100 micro;M ambroxol stimulated fMLP-induced PMNs chemiluminescence and NAC of the same concentration had no significant effect. CONCLUSION: In our experiment we showed that pretreatment with NAC and ambroxol may inhibit phagocyte influx to rat lung and may protect it from damage. We also revealed that NAC at dose 27.6 mg/kg has stronger protective properties than ambroxol at dose 70 mg/kg and this may result from enhancing effect of ambroxol on fMLP-provoked PMNs chemiluminescence.

12453069|t|Intravenous immunoglobulin G for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a meta-analysis.
12453069|a|Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has several effects on the immune system that could have a beneficial influence on disease processes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Four double-blind trials in relapsing-remitting MS have demonstrated that IVIG may reduce the relapse rate, progression and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. However, these trials were smaller than the pivotal trials of interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate, and therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the four trials in order to provide an overall assessment of the benefits of IVIG in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in comparison with other drugs currently available for treatment of disease activity in MS. The meta-analysis showed a significant beneficial effect on the annual relapse rate (effect size -0.5; P = 0.00003), on the proportion of relapse-free patients (0.29 difference; P = 2.1 x 10(-8)), change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (effect size: 0.25; P = 0.04), and a trend towards a reduction in the proportion of patients who deteriorated (P = 0.03). Each single study in the meta-analysis had its weaknesses, but all studies were positive regarding their primary end-point, and the results yield concordant evidence for reduction of relapse rate and progression. The ideal dosage of IVIG for treating MS needs still to be determined. In conclusion, IVIG may be a valuable alternative for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, but can presently not be considered as a first-line treatment. IVIG could be considered in patients who do not tolerate or are unwilling to take the approved injectable medications, but additional studies are needed to establish the role of IVIG in the management of multiple sclerosis.

22310298|t|Characterization of human cytochrome P450 induction by pesticides.
22310298|a|Pesticides are a large group of structurally diverse toxic chemicals. The toxicity may be modified by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. In the current study, we have investigated effects and mechanisms of 24 structurally varying pesticides on human CYP expression. Many pesticides were found to efficiently activate human pregnane X receptor (PXR) and/or constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Out of the 24 compounds tested, 14 increased PXR- and 15 CAR-mediated luciferase activities at least 2-fold. While PXR was predominantly activated by pyrethroids, CAR was, in addition to pyrethroids, well activated by organophosphates and several carbamates. Induction of CYP mRNAs and catalytic activities was studied in the metabolically competent, human derived HepaRG cell line. CYP3A4 mRNA was induced most powerfully by pyrethroids; 50 µM cypermethrin increased CYP3A4 mRNA 35-fold. CYP2B6 was induced fairly equally by organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid compounds. Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 by these compound classes paralleled their effects on PXR and CAR. The urea herbicide diuron and the triazine herbicide atrazine induced CYP2B6 mRNA more than 10-fold, but did not activate CAR indicating that some pesticides may induce CYP2B6 via CAR-independent mechanisms. CYP catalyzed activities were induced much less than the corresponding mRNAs. At least in some cases, this is probably due to significant inhibition of CYP enzymes by the studied pesticides. Compared with human CAR activation and CYP2B6 expression, pesticides had much less effect on mouse CAR and CYP2B10 mRNA. Altogether, pesticides were found to be powerful human CYP inducers acting through both PXR and CAR.

8497679|t|Inhaled ipratropium bromide and terbutaline in asthmatic children.
8497679|a|Inhaled bronchodilator therapy in young asthmatic children reduces symptoms and improves lung function. After a single dose of therapy, however, lung function may still be abnormal, as evidenced by an elevated function residual capacity (FRC). The aims of this study were to assess if a second dose of bronchodilator therapy resulted in further improvement in lung function and to determine whether additional therapy was more effective if given as a second dose of a beta-adrenergic agonist or if instead an anticholinergic was used. Twenty-one asthmatics (median age 7.5 years) received in random order on two separate occasions, 1 week apart, either two doses of terbutaline (500 micrograms) or terbutaline plus ipratropium bromide (20 micrograms). FRC and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured immediately prior to and then 20 min after each dose of bronchodilator therapy. In the group, overall FRC and PEFR improved after the first and second dose of bronchodilator, regardless of regime used, the response to the second dose, however, was smaller than the first dose. There was no significant difference overall between the two regimes in baseline FRC or PEFR, or FRC and PEFR measured after each dose of bronchodilator. Eight children failed to show a significant change in FRC following two doses of terbutaline, but seven of these eight did have a significant change in FRC in response to the combination of terbutaline and ipratropium bromide. We conclude that a second dose of bronchodilator therapy does further improve lung function. Our results suggest the more efficacious regime consists of a combination of single doses of ipratropium bromide and terbutaline.

22634227|t|Alternate glucocorticoid receptor ligand binding structures influence outcomes in an in vivo tissue regeneration model.
22634227|a|Since their characterization, glucocorticoids (GCs), the most commonly prescribed immunomodulatory drugs, have undergone numerous structural modifications designed to enhance their activity. In vivo assessment of these corticosteroid analogs is essential to understand the difference in molecular signaling of the ligands that share the corticosteroid backbone. Our research identified a novel function of GCs as modulators of tissue regeneration and demonstrated that GCs activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to inhibit early stages of tissue regeneration in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We utilized this phenomenon to assess the effect of different GC analogs on tissue regeneration and identified that some GCs such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) possess inhibitory properties, while others, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone have no effect on regeneration. We performed in silico molecular docking and dynamic studies and demonstrated that type and size of substitution at the C17 position of the cortisol backbone confer a unique stable conformation to GR on ligand binding that is critical for inhibitory activity. In the field of tissue regeneration, our study is one of the first Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) investigations performed in vertebrates demonstrating that the in vivo tissue regeneration model is a powerful tool to probe structure function relationships, to understand regenerative biology, and to assist in rational drug design.

12954189|t|Microcrystallization of indomethacin using a pH-shift method.
12954189|a|This study developed a microcrystallization process for indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), using a pH-shift method in aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the microcrystals produced were similar to those of the standard crystalline powder in X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses, except for a lower XRD peak height and a slightly lower melting temperature (Tm) (1.5 degrees C). Phase contrast microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the indomethacin microcrystals were plate-like with a uniform size distribution (mean diameter =10.4+/-0.4 microm). In the initial phase, the dissolution rate of the indomethacin microcrystals was about 2.2 times higher than that of the standard crystalline powder. The biological activity of the indomethacin microcrystals was about 20% higher than that of the standard crystalline powder in their ability to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells (HT-29).

16723285|t|Simultaneous determination of cytotoxic bufadienolides in the Chinese medicine ChanSu by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array and mass spectrometry detections.
16723285|a|ChanSu (toad venom) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of serious liver and gastric cancers. The major cytotoxic compounds in ChanSu are bufadienolides. In this paper, a strategy combining qualitative LC/MS analysis and quantitative HPLC determination of major bufadienolides was used for global quality control of ChanSu crude drug. Majority of the bufadienolides in methanol extract of ChanSu were unambiguously characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/APCI-MS/MS), and by comparing with pure compounds. In addition, eight major bufadienolides were simultaneously determined in one single HPLC run within 30 min with photodiode array detection (DAD). All compounds showed good linearity in a wide concentration range, and their limits of detection (LOD) were around 1 ng. Thus, > 95% of the bufadienolides in ChanSu could be characterized, and > 90% of them were quantitated. The established method is rapid, simple and sensitive, and could be used for the routine analysis of ChanSu crude drug and its preparations. This research sets a good example for the comprehensive quality control of traditional medicine.

20602568|t|Low-volume PEG plus ascorbic acid versus high-volume PEG as bowel preparation for colonoscopy.
20602568|a|OBJECTIVE: High volumes of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based solutions as bowel preparation for colonoscopy are effective, but often poorly tolerated. To compare a 2 l PEG-based solution combined with ascorbic acid (PEG + Asc) with 4 l PEG-based solution (PEG). METHODS: In a single blind, quasi-randomized, prospective study, 350 patients undergoing colonoscopy received 2 l of PEG + Asc or 4 l of PEG. For morning procedures, the total dose of PEG + Asc was taken the evening before, for afternoon colonoscopies, PEG + Asc was given as a split dose. The 4 l PEG preparation was given as a split dose. Efficacy of preparation was scored on a five-point scale in three different colon segments. Patients' experiences were evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS: From 307 patients (149 PEG + Asc, 158 PEG), results were available. Successful colon cleansing was achieved in 90.6% in the PEG + Asc group compared to 96% in the PEG group (not significant). In patients prepared with PEG + Asc, bowel cleansing was worse when patients underwent colonoscopy in the morning, compared to afternoon procedures. Side-effects and patients' experiences were similar in the PEG + Asc and PEG group. CONCLUSIONS: Low-volume PEG + ascorbic acid has comparable efficacy and tolerability as high-volume PEG solution. The cleansing results were worse if patients received the full dose PEG + Asc the evening before the procedure compared to the split dose. Our data support the administration of PEG + Asc as a split dose before the procedure.

22254088|t|Higher urinary sodium, a proxy for intake, is associated with increased calcium excretion and lower hip bone density in healthy young women with lower calcium intakes.
22254088|a|We assessed 24-h urinary sodium (Na) and its relationship with urinary calcium (Ca) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the whole body, lumbar spine and total hip in a cross-sectional study. 102 healthy non-obese women completed timed 24-h urine collections which were analyzed for Na and Ca. Dietary intakes were estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Participants were grouped as those with lower vs. higher calcium intake by median split (506 mg/1000 kcal). Dietary Na intake correlated with 24-h urinary loss. Urinary Na correlated positively with urinary Ca for all participants (r = 0.29, p < 0.01) and among those with lower (r = 0.37, p < 0.01) but not higher calcium intakes (r = 0.19, p = 0.19). Urinary Na was inversely associated with hip aBMD for all participants (r = -0.21, p = 0.04) and among women with lower (r = -0.36, p < 0.01) but not higher (r = -0.05, p = 0.71) calcium intakes. Urinary Na also entered a regression equation for hip aBMD in women with lower Ca intakes, contributing 5.9% to explained variance. In conclusion, 24-h urinary Na (a proxy for intake) is associated with higher urinary Ca loss in young women and may affect aBMD, particularly in those with lower calcium intakes.

22082587|t|Clinical application of a systems model of apoptosis execution for the prediction of colorectal cancer therapy responses and personalisation of therapy.
22082587|a|OBJECTIVE: Key to the clinical management of colorectal cancer is identifying tools which aid in assessing patient prognosis and determining more effective and personalised treatment strategies. We evaluated whether an experimental systems biology strategy which analyses the susceptibility of cancer cells to undergo caspase activation can be exploited to predict patient responses to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and to case-specifically identify potential alternative targeted treatments to reactivate apoptosis. DESIGN: We quantified five essential apoptosis-regulating proteins (Pro-Caspases 3 and 9, APAF-1, SMAC and XIAP) in samples of Stage II (n = 13) and III (n=17) tumour and normal colonic (n = 8) tissue using absolute quantitative immunoblotting and employed systems simulations of apoptosis signalling to predict the susceptibility of tumour cells to execute apoptosis. Additional systems analyses assessed the efficacy of novel apoptosis-inducing therapeutics such as XIAP antagonists, proteasome inhibitors and Pro-Caspase-3-activating compounds in restoring apoptosis execution in apoptosis-incompetent tumours. RESULTS: Comparisons of caspase activity profiles demonstrated that the likelihood of colorectal tumours to undergo apoptosis decreases with advancing disease stage. Systems-level analysis correctly predicted positive or negative outcome in 85% (p=0.004) of colorectal cancer patients receiving 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy and significantly outperformed common uni- and multi-variate statistical approaches. Modelling of individual patient responses to novel apoptosis-inducing therapeutics revealed markedly different inter-individual responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first proof-of-concept example demonstrating the significant clinical potential of systems biology-based approaches for predicting patient outcome and responsiveness to novel targeted treatment paradigms.

1480060|t|Matrix metalloproteinases in periodontal tissue remodelling.
1480060|a|Inflammation of the periodontium leads to connective tissue degradation and eventual tooth loss. The regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been studied to determine their role in these processes and also during tissue remodelling. Analysis of gingival crevicular fluid has revealed the presence of collagenase and gelatinase that, in the acute stages of periodontal disease, are derived predominantly from polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These MMPs appear to be intimately associated with tissue destruction since the levels of the active forms of these enzymes obtained from either crevicular fluid or mouthrinse samples correlate with tissue destruction and, therefore, provide a sensitive means of demonstrating disease activity. Transforming growth factor-beta, an important regulator of connective tissue remodelling, has been implicated in the rapid remodelling of periodontal tissues. TGF-beta promotes tissue matrix formation by stimulating both the synthesis of matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin and SPARC) and proteinase inhibitors (TIMP, PAI-1) and by decreasing the synthesis of MMPs, but not the 72 kDa-gelatinase. Nuclear run-on analyses have shown that TGF-beta reduces collagenase and stromelysin synthesis by suppressing gene transcription without altering mRNA stabilities. In contrast, the transcription of the gelatinase and TIMP genes was increased by TGF-beta, which also increased gelatinase mRNA stability. Remodelling of alveolar bone involves interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts, under the influence of osteotropic hormones (vit D3, PTH and retinoic acid), produce MMPs which appear to function in the removal of soft tissue that precludes access of osteoclasts to the mineralized tissue surface. Rat osteoblastic cells produce MMPs with activity on native collagen, native collagen 3/4-fragments and gelatin and, in addition, two forms of TIMP activity. The 3/4-collagen endopeptidase, purified to apparent homogeneity, also has significant collagenase and gelatinase activities and an amino terminal sequence almost identical to human 72 kDa-gelatinase. The production of this enzyme was stimulated by TGF-beta, which suppresses bone resorption, and by osteotropic hormones which stimulate bone resorption, supporting a bifunctional role for the gelatinase in connective tissue remodelling. Although there is strong evidence for the involvement of MMPs in the resorption of bone and in the inflammation-mediated destruction of periodontal tissues, the role of MMPs in the remodelling of mature soft connective tissues remains equivocal.

18541571|t|Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of selenium supplements among HIV-infected pregnant women in Tanzania: effects on maternal and child outcomes.
18541571|a|BACKGROUND: In observational studies, adequate selenium status has been associated with better pregnancy outcomes and slowed HIV disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of daily selenium supplements on CD4 cell counts, viral load, pregnancy outcomes, and maternal and infant mortality among 913 HIV-infected pregnant women. DESIGN: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, eligible women between 12 and 27 wk of gestation were given daily selenium (200 mug as selenomethionine) or placebo as supplements from recruitment until 6 mo after delivery. All women received prenatal iron, folic acid, and multivitamin supplements irrespective of experimental assignment. RESULTS: The selenium regimen had no significant effect on maternal CD4 cell counts or viral load. Selenium was marginally associated with a reduced risk of low birth weight [relative risk (RR) = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; P = 0.09] and increased risk of fetal death (RR = 1.58; 95% CI = 0.95, 2.63; P = 0.08), but had no effect on risk of prematurity or small-for-gestational age birth. The regimen had no significant effect on maternal mortality (RR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.51, 2.04; P = 0.96). There was no significant effect on neonatal or overall child mortality, but selenium reduced the risk of child mortality after 6 wk (RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.99; P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected women from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, selenium supplements given during and after pregnancy did not improve HIV disease progression or pregnancy outcomes, but may improve child survival. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00197561.

21741829|t|Trastuzumab beyond progression: overall survival analysis of the GBG 26/BIG 3-05 phase III study in HER2-positive breast cancer.
21741829|a|BACKGROUND: Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine (XH) showed a significantly improved overall response rate and time to progression compared with capecitabine (X) alone in women with HER2-positive breast cancer progressing during trastuzumab treatment. Here, we report the final analysis on overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer who progressed during treatment with trastuzumab with or without 1st-line metastatic chemotherapy were prospectively randomised to X (2500mg/m(2) on days 1-14, q3w) or XH (6 (8)mg/kg, q3w). Overall survival was a pre-specified secondary end-point. RESULTS: Median follow-up at June 2010 was 20.7months. Fifty nine of 74 and 60 of 77 patients died in the X and XH arm, respectively. Median overall survival was 20.6 and 24.9months with X and XH, respectively (HR=0.94 [0.65-1.35]; p=0.73). Performance status and metastatic site were independent prognosticators for overall survival. No difference between treatment arms was observed for patients who achieved clinical response or clinical benefit, respectively. Patients who continued/restarted anti-HER2 treatment (trastuzumab or lapatinib) after 2nd progression (N=52) had a post-progression survival of 18.8 compared with 13.3months for those who did not receive 3rd line treatment with anti-HER2 agents (N=88) (HR 0.63; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Final overall survival analysis of the GBG-26 study did not demonstrate a significant survival benefit for treatment beyond progression with trastuzumab. However, in a post-hoc analysis, patients receiving anti-HER2 treatment as 3rd line therapy showed a better post-progression survival than those not receiving this targeted treatment.

24749828|t|Review article: the biology, diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.
24749828|a|BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract with an increasing incidence. AIMS: To review the biology, diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours. METHODS: A PubMed search using the phrases 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'imatinib', 'c-kit'. RESULTS: The diagnosis of GIST is established by histology supplemented by the immunohistochemical marker CD117, which is positive in 95% of cases. The most common site of the tumour is the stomach. Most GIST are benign with 20-30% malignant. Five-year survival for malignant GIST ranges between 35% and 65% and depends primarily on tumour size, mitotic index and location. The malignant behaviour of GIST is best assessed by invasion of adjacent structures and distant metastases. The gold standard for treatment is surgical resection. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the primary therapy for unresectable, recurrent or metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours are rare tumours of the gastrointestinal tract and they vary in presentation. When surgical resection is not achievable, imatinib is the treatment of choice.

10660975|t|Study of fluticasone propionate efficacy in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma not controlled by other inhaled corticosteroids.
10660975|a|The aim of the study was to test the fluticasone propionate (FP) efficacy in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma (BA), not controlled by high doses (more than 1 mg) of other inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma symptoms (degree of dyspnea on Sadoul scale, percentage of symptom-free days and nights), and drug consumption were measured and lung function tests were performed in 20 patients (11 women and 9 men, mean age 47 years) for a 2 months period. Biochemical measurements were done referring to oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, which is characteristic to inflammatory diseases of respiratory system. We evaluated lipoperoxidation (LPO) in the plasma and the blood, before and after FP treatment, by determining malondialdehyde (MDA) status, superoxide-dismutase and ceruloplasmine activity and non-protein SH groups (essential glutathione) status. The biochemical measurements showed a significant decrease in lipid peroxides level in the plasma and the blood and a slight increase of glutathione after 2 months treatment with FP. Lung function tests were performed on a Flow Streen Jaeger and we determined: peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1) and mid-expiratory flow at 50% VC (MEF50). The measurements were done before FP administration, after 3 days, 7 days, 1 month and 2 months. The dose of FP was equivalent to 50-75% of the daily dose of Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) previously administered. The degree of dyspnea diminished from 3-4 to 0-1. The percentage of symptom-free days and nights improved from 12% to 78% and 25% to 95% respectively. The use of short acting beta agonists diminished with 75% and no patients required i.v. corticotherapy or theophylline. PEF increased with a mean of 25%, VC with a mean of 23%, FEV1 with a mean of 30% and MEF50 with a mean of 36%. Our results demonstrate improved efficacy of FP vs high doses of other inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate persistent and severe forms of BA.

15242349|t|Tetracycline-regulated expression enables purification and functional analysis of recombinant connexin channels from mammalian cells.
15242349|a|Intercellular coupling mediated by gap junction channels composed of connexin protein underlies numerous physiological processes, such as cellular differentiation, tissue synchronization and metabolic homoeostasis. The distinct molecular permeability of junctional channels composed of different connexin isoforms allows cellular control of coupling via regulation of isoform expression. However, the permeability properties of most connexin isoforms have not been well characterized due to the difficulty of manipulating and measuring the diffusible concentrations of cytoplasmic messenger molecules and metabolites, and to a lack of control over channel isoform composition, in vivo. Here we present a method to express and purify active connexin hemichannels of a single isoform or a consistent ratio of two isoforms from cultured cells using the Tet-On inducible expression system and one-step anti-haemagglutinin immunoaffinity purification. The procedure yields 10-20 microg of pure connexin protein from 2.5x10(8) HeLa cells. The purified channels are shown to be useful for in vitro permeability analysis using well established techniques. This method has substantial advantages over existing methods for heterologous connexin expression, such as the ease of co-expression of two isoforms at a constant ratio, consistently high expression levels over many passages, and the ability to study channel properties in situ as well as in purified form. Furthermore, the generic cloning site of the new pBI-GT vector and the commercial availability of anti-haemagglutinin (clone HA-7)-agarose make this affinity tagging and purification procedure easily applicable to other proteins.

8506886|t|Influence of labetalol on cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction in humans.
8506886|a|PURPOSE: Although labetalol is sometimes given to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, its influence on cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 15 patients (7 men, 8 women, aged 40 to 79 years) undergoing catheterization for chest pain, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and coronary arterial area (by computer-assisted quantitative angiography) were measured (1) at baseline, (2) 15 minutes after intranasal cocaine, 2 mg/kg, then (3) 5 minutes after intravenous saline (n = 6) or labetalol, 0.25 mg/kg (n = 9). RESULTS: Of 40 coronary arterial segments analyzed, cocaine induced a 13% +/- 10% (mean +/- standard deviation) decrease in coronary arterial area in 32. Subsequently, no variable changed after saline administration. Although labetalol reduced mean arterial pressure (117 +/- 14 mm Hg after cocaine, 110 +/- 11 mm Hg after labetalol; p < 0.05), it induced no change in the coronary arterial area (3.47 +/- 1.37 mm2 after cocaine, 3.37 +/- 1.32 mm2 after labetalol; p = NS). CONCLUSION: Labetalol reverses the cocaine-induced rise in mean arterial pressure, but does not alleviate cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction.

1411092|t|Analysis of glycosaminoglycans in human serum after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate.
1411092|a|Chondroitin sulfate was administered orally to six healthy volunteers, six patients with rheumatoid arthritis and six patients with osteoarthritis. Blood was collected at intervals before and after treatment and the glycosaminoglycan concentration was analyzed in serum using a sensitive assay based on the metachromatic reaction with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue. The glycosaminoglycan concentration in serum before and after ingestion of chondroitin sulfate was statistically unchanged in all of the subjects studied. We suggest that chondroprotection by orally administered chondroitin sulfate is a biologically and pharmacologically unfounded theory. Any possible benefit to osteoarthritic patients after ingestion of chondroitin sulfate should be sought at the gastrointestinal rather than at the plasmatic or articular cartilage level.

19019354|t|Combined analysis of prenatal (maternal hair and blood) and neonatal (infant hair, cord blood and meconium) matrices to detect fetal exposure to environmental pesticides.
19019354|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine optimum biomarkers to detect fetal exposure to environmental pesticides by the simultaneous analysis of maternal (hair and blood) and infant (cord blood, infant hair or meconium) matrices and to determine if a combination of these biomarkers will further increase the detection rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively recruited from an agricultural site in the Philippines with substantial use at home and in the farm of the following pesticides: propoxur, cyfluthrin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, pretilachlor, bioallethrin, malathion, diazinon and transfluthrin. Maternal hair and blood were obtained at midgestation and at delivery and infant hair, cord blood and meconium were obtained after birth. All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the above pesticides and some of their metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 598 mother/infant dyads were included in this report. The highest rates of pesticide exposure were detected in meconium (23.2% to propoxur, 2.0% to pretilachlor, 1.7% to cypermethrin, 0.8% to cyfluthrin, 0.7% to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis, p-chlorophenylethane (DDT) and 0.3% to malathion and bioallethrin) and in maternal hair (21.6% to propoxur, 14.5% to bioallethrin, 1.3% to malathion, 0.8% to DDT, 0.3% to chlorpyrifos and 0.2% to pretilachlor). Combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium increased detection rate further to 38.5% for propoxur and to 16.7% for pyrethroids. Pesticide metabolites were rarely found in any of the analyzed matrices. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant exposure of the pregnant woman and her fetus to pesticides, particularly to the home pesticides, propoxur and pyrethroids. Analysis of meconium for pesticides was the single most sensitive measure of exposure. However, combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium significantly increased the detection rate. A major advantage of analyzing maternal hair is that prenatal pesticide exposure in the mother can be detected and intervention measures can be initiated to minimize further exposure of the fetus to pesticides.

2187352|t|Maternal indomethacin therapy in the treatment of polyhydramnios.
2187352|a|Fifteen patients with polyhydramnios and clinical symptoms related to excess amniotic fluid volume were treated with indomethacin therapy that was started at a mean gestational age of 27.4 +/- 2.79 weeks and discontinued at a mean gestational age of 32.9 +/- 1.83 weeks. Patients were treated with 2.0 to 2.2 mg of indomethacin per kilogram of body weight per day, either orally or by rectal suppositories. No therapy was administered after 35 weeks, and the duration of therapy was no longer than 4 weeks. The majority of fluid reduction occurred within the first week of treatment. Subsequently, a smaller but steady reduction of fluid was observed. All patients were delivered after 38 weeks with a mean birth weight of 3543 +/- 586.3 gm. Examinations of newborns at birth and follow-up at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year revealed no adverse effects of indomethacin administration.

9498284|t|Heterologous expression of rat P450 2E1 in a mammalian cell line: in situ metabolism and cytotoxicity of N-nitrosodimethylamine.
9498284|a|GM0637, a human fibroblast cell line, was transfected with pCMV2E1, an expression vector containing the full length cDNA for rat cytochrome P450 2E1 (P450 2E1), and with pCMVneo, which contained vector alone, and the selected clones were designated GM2E1 and GMneo, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that GM2E1, but not GMneo, expressed a protein that reacted with anti-human P450 2E1 antibody. The 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase,p-nitrophenol hydroxylase, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) demethylase activities of the P450 in these cells were measured in monolayer cell cultures without preparing microsomes. Exposure of the GM2E1 cells to NDMA for 4 days caused severe decreases in cell viability, as determined by crystal violet uptake, and showed a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a median lethal dose of 17 microM. In contrast, the viability of GMneo cells was not altered by NDMA even at concentrations up to 10 mM. Time- and concentration-dependent methylation of DNA, RNA and protein by [14C]NDMA was only observed in cells expressing P450 2E1. Inhibitors of P450 2E1 activity such as ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, and isoniazid caused a 90% decrease in the methylation of cellular macromolecules and also completely protected the cells against NDMA-mediated toxicity. The cytotoxicity due to exposure to NDMA was partially inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone but was not potentiated upon glutathione depletion. These results document the ability of rat P450 2E1 to metabolize NDMA to toxic reactive intermediates and demonstrate that this cell line provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of metabolism-mediated toxicity and carcinogenesis.

19027166|t|Antiproliferative activity and QSAR study of copper(II) mixed chelate [Cu(N-N)(acetylacetonato)]NO3 and [Cu(N-N)(glycinato)]NO3 complexes, (CasiopeÃ­nas).
19027166|a|Mixed chelate copper(II) complexes patented and mark title registered as CasiopeÃ­nas are antineoplastic agents with general formulas [Cu(N-N)(alpha-l-amino acidato)]NO(3) and [Cu(N-N)(O-O)]NO(3), where the N-N donor is an aromatic substituted diimine (1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy)) and the O-O donor is acetylacetonate (acac) or salicylaldehydate (salal). In the present work, the series of complexes [Cu(N-N)(acac)]NO(3) and [Cu(N-N)(gly)]NO(3) with several substituents on the diimine ligand were selected to perform a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study. Two main analysis were performed: (1) the study of the influence of the substituents on diimine ligand on physicochemical properties such as half-wave potential (E(1/2)) and their relationship with medial lethal dose (LD50) or medial inhibitory concentration (IC50) on several tumor cell lines and (2) the study of the influence of the secondary ligand when acac is changed for glycinate (gly). Results showed that the presence of the central fused aromatic ring in the phen containing complexes is necessary to preserve the antiproliferative activity. The QSAR equations showed a strong relationship between the IC50 and E(1/2); the most active complexes are the weaker oxidants. The change of secondary ligand from acac to gly has less influence on biological activity than the changes on the diimine ligand.

9613742|t|Clinical comparison of tardive and idiopathic cervical dystonia.
9613742|a|It has been suggested that tardive cervical dystonia may be clinically indistinguishable from the idiopathic form and that the diagnosis rests solely on documenting an exposure to dopamine antagonist medications. To investigate this, we performed a retrospective evaluation of patient records on 102 patients with idiopathic and 20 patients with tardive cervical dystonia seen in our Movement Disorder Clinic over the past 8 years. Several clinical and demographic variables were compared and a number of differences were observed. The presence of extracervical involvement, retrocollis, and spasmodic head movements were individually found to be predictive of tardive cervical dystonia. Torticollis, laterocollis, and trick maneuvers were predictive of idiopathic cervical dystonia. Head tremor (42.2%) and family history of dystonia (9.8%) were present only in the idiopathic group. Cervical muscle hypertrophy was significantly more common in the idiopathic group (100% versus 75%). No difference was found between the two groups in their response to treatment with botulinum toxin A. These results indicate that clinical differences between idiopathic and tardive cervical dystonia exist. These differences may help to distinguish them in the clinical setting, improve diagnostic accuracy, and support the existence of a causal relationship between exposure to dopamine antagonist medications and chronic dystonia.

17079761|t|Left ventricular assist device and drug therapy for the reversal of heart failure.
17079761|a|BACKGROUND: In patients with severe heart failure, prolonged unloading of the myocardium with the use of a left ventricular assist device has been reported to lead to myocardial recovery in small numbers of patients for varying periods of time. Increasing the frequency and durability of myocardial recovery could reduce or postpone the need for subsequent heart transplantation. METHODS: We enrolled 15 patients with severe heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy and with no histologic evidence of active myocarditis. All had markedly reduced cardiac output and were receiving inotropes. The patients underwent implantation of left ventricular assist devices and were treated with lisinopril, carvedilol, spironolactone, and losartan to enhance reverse remodeling. Once regression of left ventricular enlargement had been achieved, the beta2-adrenergic-receptor agonist clenbuterol was administered to prevent myocardial atrophy. RESULTS: Eleven of the 15 patients had sufficient myocardial recovery to undergo explantation of the left ventricular assist device a mean (+/-SD) of 320+/-186 days after implantation of the device. One patient died of intractable arrhythmias 24 hours after explantation; another died of carcinoma of the lung 27 months after explantation. The cumulative rate of freedom from recurrent heart failure among the surviving patients was 100% and 88.9% 1 and 4 years after explantation, respectively. The quality of life as assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score at 3 years was nearly normal. Fifty-nine months after explantation, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 64+/-12%, the mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 59.4+/-12.1 mm, the mean left ventricular end-systolic diameter was 42.5+/-13.2 mm, and the mean maximal oxygen uptake with exercise was 26.3+/-6.0 ml per kilogram of body weight per minute. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, we found that sustained reversal of severe heart failure secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy could be achieved in selected patients with the use of a left ventricular assist device and a specific pharmacologic regimen.

15686901|a|The syntheses of nine argentatin A analogs are described. These compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit growth in vitro in four human cancer cell lines. Our results showed that the presence of either a double bond at C-1/C-2, or a bromine atom or formyl moiety at C-2 as well as the presence of an isoxazol ring in argentatin A enhanced its potency in all cell lines tested. In addition, an X-ray study of (16S,17R,20S,24R)-3-oxime-20,24-epoxy-16,25-dihydroxy-cycloartan-3-one led to the determination of the correct stereochemistry of argentatin A.

24089539|t|Short leg length, a marker of early childhood deprivation, is associated with metabolic disorders underlying type 2 diabetes: the PROMISE cohort study.
24089539|a|OBJECTIVE: Short leg length, a marker of early childhood deprivation, has been used in studies of the association of early life conditions with adult chronic disease risk. The objective of this study was to determine the cross-sectional associations of leg length with measures of insulin sensitivity and b-cell function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects (n = 462) at risk for type 2 diabetes were recruited into the PROspective Metabolism and ISlet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) longitudinal cohort. Leg length was calculated from sitting and standing height at the 3-year clinical examination. Glucose tolerance status was determined using an oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI), while the insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the insulin secretion sensitivity index 2 (ISSI-2) determined b-cell function. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted, adjusting for covariates including age, sex, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, waist, and weight. RESULTS: Leg length and leg-to-height ratio were significantly associated with HOMA-IR (b = -0.037, b = -10.49, respectively; P < 0.0001), ISI (b = 0.035, b = 8.83, respectively; P < 0.0001), IGI/IR (b = 0.021, P < 0.05; b = 7.60, P < 0.01, respectively), and ISSI-2 (b = 0.01, P < 0.03; b = 3.34, P < 0.01, respectively) after adjustment for covariates. The association of shorter leg length with lower insulin sensitivity was most evident for those with high waist circumferences. CONCLUSIONS: Shorter legs were independently associated with lower insulin sensitivity and b-cell function, suggesting that early childhood deprivation may increase the risk of developing diabetes.

25512083|t|The sphingosine-1-phosphate/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 axis regulates early airway T-cell infiltration in murine mast cell-dependent acute allergic responses.
25512083|a|BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid produced by mast cells (MCs) on cross-linking of their high-affinity receptors for IgE by antigen that can amplify MC responses by binding to its S1P receptors. An acute MC-dependent allergic reaction can lead to systemic shock, but the early events of its development in lung tissues have not been investigated, and S1P functions in the onset of allergic processes remain to be examined. OBJECTIVE: We used a highly specific neutralizing anti-S1P antibody (mAb) and the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) antagonist JTE-013 to study the signaling contributions of S1P and S1PR2 to MC- and IgE-dependent airway allergic responses in mice within minutes after antigen challenge. METHODS: Allergic reaction was triggered by a single intraperitoneal dose of antigen in sensitized mice pretreated intraperitoneally with anti-S1P, isotype control mAb, JTE-013, or vehicle before antigen challenge. RESULTS: Kinetics experiments revealed early pulmonary infiltration of mostly T cells around blood vessels of sensitized mice 20 minutes after antigen exposure. Pretreatment with anti-S1P mAb inhibited in  vitro MC activation, as well as in  vivo development of airway infiltration and MC activation, reducing serum levels of histamine, cytokines, and the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/CCL2, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a/CCL3, and RANTES/CCL5. S1PR2 antagonism or deficiency or MC deficiency recapitulated these results. Both in  vitro and in  vivo experiments demonstrated MC S1PR2 dependency for chemokine release and the necessity for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. CONCLUSION: Activation of S1PR2 by S1P and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling in MCs regulate early T-cell recruitment to antigen-challenged lungs through chemokine production.

8123218|t|Are binge drinkers more at risk of developing brain damage?
8123218|a|Alcoholism is often associated with brain damage and cognitive deficits. Because drinking patterns can include periods of alcohol consumption followed by abstinence, binge drinking may enhance the possibility of brain damage. Chronic administration of ethanol leads to upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and calcium receptors and increased release of glucocorticoids. NMDA-mediated mechanisms and glucocorticoid actions on the hippocampus are associated with brain damage. Thus, ethanol withdrawal may make the brain more vulnerable to damage from these mechanisms, especially with binge drinking. Therapeutic adjuncts for treating ethanol withdrawal, including NMDA, calcium, and glucocorticoid antagonists, may eventually prove useful in preventing further brain damage in alcoholism.

23812905|t|A phase II study of combined VEGF inhibitor (bevacizumab+sorafenib) in patients with metastatic breast cancer: Hoosier Oncology Group Study BRE06-109.
23812905|a|PURPOSE: Angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumor development, invasion and metastasis. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual angiogenesis blockade with bevacizumab and sorafenib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in any setting were treated with sorafenib 200 mg as a single oral dose daily plus bevacizumab intravenously 5 mg/kg every other week. Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 yo, all had good performance status KPS of 0 or 1, and 17 patients had received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Median PFS was 2.8 months. There were no complete or partial responses; 3 patients had stable disease for >6 months. Toxicity was substantial with 9 (50 %) patients reporting Grade 3 toxicity. Seven (39 %) patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events including hypertension (N=2), GI toxicity (N=1), sensory neuropathy (N=1), rash (N=1), pain (N=1) and wound complication (N=1). Given the lack of clear efficacy and increased toxicity, accrual was terminated. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab has substantial toxicity and minimal efficacy in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. Further study of this combination is not recommended.

1897516|t|The effect of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 for prolongation of leukemic transformation-free survival in myelodysplastic syndromes.
1897516|a|Leukemic transformation (LT) free survival was studied in 30 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In 15 cases, 4-6 micrograms/day of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 was administered, for a median duration of 17 months (D-group), other subjects had no therapy (N group). LT free survival of the D group had significant advantage over that of the N group according to the Kaplan-Meier method (P less than 0.001). In addition, 7 cases in the N group developed acute leukemia, in contrast to only one in the D group (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that oral administration of 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 prevents the progression of MDS to overt leukemia under the effect of differentiation capacity from blasts to monocytes.

17001111|t|Effect of levothyroxine on total lipid profiles as assessed by analytical capillary isotachophoresis in a patient with hypothyroidism.
17001111|a|The patient was a 51-year-old Japanese female who had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. At the first medical examination, her serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were 482 and 205 mg/dl, respectively. Since hyperlipidemia was not improved by pravastatin, atorvastatin or niceritrol, and since the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 were 730 IU/ml and 0.3 ng/dl, respectively, the patient was diagnosed as secondary hyperlipidemia with hypothyroidism. A method for the charge isolation of lipoproteins using capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) is proposed as a clinical application because it allows us to quantitatively measure electronegative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a potent marker of coronary heart disease. After 5 months of treatment with levothyroxine, Serum TC and LDL-C levels drastically decreased without statin treatment and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased. In the lipoprotein profiles as assessed by cITP after treatment with levothyroxin, all HDL-C subfractions were increased and fast-migrating LDL/electronegative LDL appeared to be greatly reduced after treatment, while the area under the non-modified LDL peak was increased. The cITP analysis was able to obtain more information about coronary risk factors and may be clinically useful for evaluating the effect of treatment with levothyroxine in patients with hypothyroidism and secondary hyperlipidemia.

19924809|t|Lipopolysaccharide exposure is linked to activation of the acute phase response and growth failure in pediatric Crohn's disease and murine colitis.
19924809|a|BACKGROUND: Systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been linked to clinical disease activity in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We hypothesized that markers of LPS exposure and the acute phase response (APR) would be increased in pediatric IBD patients with growth failure, and that LPS signaling would be required for induction of the APR in murine colitis. METHODS: Serum markers of LPS exposure, endotoxin core IgA antibody (EndoCAb), and the APR, LPS binding protein (LBP) were quantified in pediatric IBD patients and controls. LBP and cytokine production were determined after administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) enemas to mice with genetic deletion of Toll-Like receptor 4 (TLR4), and wildtype (WT) controls. RESULTS: Serum EndoCAb and LBP were significantly elevated in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared to disease controls with ulcerative colitis (UC) and healthy controls (P < 0.001). This was independent of disease activity or location. CD patients with elevated serum EndoCAb and LBP exhibited linear growth failure which persisted during therapy. Serum LBP increased in WT mice following TNBS administration, in conjunction with increased serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10, and expansion of regulatory T-cell numbers. Both the APR and expansion of foxp3+ T cells were abrogated in TLR4-deficient mice, in conjunction with a reduction in acute weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: LPS exposure and a persistent APR are associated with growth failure in pediatric CD. LPS signaling is required for the APR in murine colitis. Therapies targeting this pathway may benefit the subset of patients with refractory growth failure.

17975680|t|Life-threatening hyperkalaemia developing following excessive ingestion of orange juice in a patient with baseline normal renal function.
17975680|a|Hyperkalaemia is a less-recognised life-threatening cause of paralysis. We describe a 51-year-old African-American man, who suffered from muscle weakness progressing to ascending symmetric paralysis, and inability to masticate. Physical examination revealed flaccid paralysis with areflexia of the four limbs. Computed tomography of the brain and cervical spine did not demonstrate any organic lesions. Laboratory investigations revealed serum potassium 9.0 mEq/L (not haemolysed), blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL. Electrocardiography showed typical features of hyperkalaemia. After emergent treatment for hyperkalaemia was initiated, serum potassium was rapidly-normalised to 5 mEq/L and all neuromuscular symptoms reversed within one hour. Upon reviewing his food and medication history, he admitted drinking 2.5 litres of orange juice (which contains about 450 mg of potassium in 1,000 ml) per day for the past three weeks to quench his thirst. Hyperkalaemia should be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of acute paralysis. Hidden sources of potassium intake, such as orange juice, should not be overlooked, even in patients with baseline normal renal function.

21981383|t|Melasma: treatment strategy.
21981383|a|Melasma, a hypermelanosis of the face, is a common skin problem of middle-aged women of all racial groups, especially with dark complexion. Its precise etio-pathogenesis is evasive, genetic influences, exposure to sunlight, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, estrogen-progesterone therapies, thyroid dysfunction, cosmetics, and drugs have been proposed. Centro-facial, malar, and mandibular are well-recognized. Epidermal pigmentation appears brown/black, while dermal is blue in color, and can be distinguished by Wood's lamp illumination. The difference may be inapparent with mixed type of melasma in skin types V and VI. An increase in melanin in epidermis: basal and suprabasal layers and/or dermis is the prime defect. There is an increased expression of tyrosinase related protein-1 involved in eumelanin synthesis. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreen is important, lightening agents like retinoic acid (tretinoin), azelaic acid, and combination therapies containing hydroquinone, tretinoin, and corticosteroids, have been used in the treatment of melasma, and are thought to have increased efficacy as compared with monotherapy. Quasi-drugs, placental extracts, ellagic acid, chamomilla extract, butylresorcinol, tranexamic acid, methoxy potassium salicylate, adenosine monophosphate disodium salt, dipropyl-biphenyl-2,2'-diol, (4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol, and tranexamic acid cetyl ester hydrochloride, in addition to kojic and ascorbic acid have been used. Chemical peeling is a good adjunct. Laser treatment is worthwhile.

17314045|t|Phosph(on)ate as a zinc-binding group in metalloenzyme inhibitors: X-ray crystal structure of the antiviral drug foscarnet complexed to human carbonic anhydrase I.
17314045|a|Foscarnet (phosphonoformate trisodium salt), an antiviral used for the treatment of HIV and herpes virus infections, also acts as an activator or inhibitor of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1). Interaction of the drug with 11 CA isozymes has been investigated kinetically, and the X-ray structure of its adduct with isoform I (hCA I-foscarnet complex) has been resolved. The first CA inhibitor possessing a phosphonate zinc-binding group is thus evidenced, together with the factors governing recognition of such small molecules by a metalloenzyme active site. Foscarnet is also a clear-cut example of modulator of an enzyme activity which can act either as an activator or inhibitor of a CA isozyme.

11322269|t|The role of didanosine in the management of HIV-1 infection.
11322269|a|Large-scale clinical end point studies comparing antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine alone, didanosine alone, and zidovudine combined with didanosine indicate that both didanosine alone and zidovudine/didanosine provide a better clinical outcome than zidovudine alone in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The superiority of combination didanosine/zidovudine therapy over zidovudine monotherapy was most significant in treatment-naive patients, but benefit was also seen in patients who had previously received zidovudine and also in all stages of disease. Activity marker data from other studies suggest that double or triple combination therapies that include didanosine and nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors result in powerful suppression of viral replication that will provide additional clinical benefits. Apart from mostly mild gastrointestinal disturbances, didanosine alone and in various combination therapies has been generally well tolerated. Thus, didanosine represents a potent, versatile nucleoside analogue with potential benefits in both current and future antiretroviral regimens for HIV infection.

11743900|t|Effect of theophylline on airway inflammation in asthma.
11743900|a|AIM: To investigate whether low dose theophylline has an anti-inflammatory effect in asthma. METHODS: Nineteen asthmatic subjects were given 200 mg sustained-release theophylline preparation twice daily for 4 weeks. The mean serum concentration of theophylline was 7.9 mg/L. The percentage of eosinophils, EG2+ eosinophils, and the level of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in sputum pre- and post-administration were detected by Wright's stain, immunocytochemistry, and immuno-CAP system, and the symptom scores and lung function were evaluated as well. The above indices for 10 healthy subjects were regarded as control. RESULTS: Before using theophylline, sputum eosinophils, EG2+ eosinophils, and ECP in asthmatic group were much higher than those of healthy group. After four weeks administration, there were great decreases in percentage of total eosinophils (40 % +/- 17 % vs 29 % +/- 11 %, P < 0.01), activated (EG2+) eosinophils (28 % +/- 9 % vs 10 % +/- 8 %, P < 0.01) and in the concentration of sputum ECP [(373 +/- 206) vs (220 +/- 132) microg/L, P < 0.01]. The symptom scores decreased greatly (7.1 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.6, P < 0.01). There was a marked increased in forced expiratory volume one second (FEV(1.0)) after administration (2.2 +/- 0.6 vs 2.4 +/- 0.5, P < 0.01). The FEV(1.0) % of asthmatic subjects after administration increased (60 % +/- 13 % vs 65 % +/- 13 %, P < 0.01), too. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that low dose theophylline had inhibitory action on airway inflammation in asthma with noticeable improvement of the patients' symptoms and lung function.

21134486|t|Chaotic neovascularization induced by aggressive fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.
21134486|a|S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines essential for cell proliferation. Overexpression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in rodent fibroblasts led to aggressive transformants (Amdc-s cells) that had unforeseen high invasive capacity in nude mice, invading rapidly from the subcutaneous injection site into the peritoneal cavity and its organs. In vitro, these cells were much more invasive than Ras-oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, or human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In immunohistological characterization, Amdc-s-induced tumors showed chaotic neovascularization, with abundant pleomorphic vessel-like structures that had noncontiguous or totally missing laminin (basement membrane) and CD31 (endothelial cell) immunoreactivity. Gene expression and protein analyses of Amdc-s cells showed them to overexpress several pro-angiogenic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and to exhibit profound down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). By reintroduction of TSP-1 into Amdc-s cells, the high invasiveness was efficiently inhibited in vitro. Interestingly, Amdc-s cells showed up-regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and also expressed the MET receptor, creating thus an autocrine loop able to regulate VEGF-A and TSP-1 levels. Further, we found Amdc-s cells to express increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the large isoform of tenascin-C (TN-C), which may also contribute to the angiogenic switch and invasiveness. Consequently, Amdc-s cells offer an excellent model to sort out the key molecules of aggressive tumor growth, and thereby help in designing rational, novel anti-vascular and other cancer therapies.

22731702|t|Management of granulomatous mastitis: a series of 14 patients.
22731702|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the history of relapses in idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) and to define an appropriate therapeutic strategy. The duration and number of relapses are unpredictable, and the roles of surgery and corticosteroids remain controversial. STUDY DESIGN: A series of 14 patients with IGM and a mean follow-up of 61.5  ± 73 (SD) months were retrospectively studied in the Gynecology Unit (Hotel Dieu Hospital, Paris, France). Main outcome measure was number of relapses per year before and following corticosteroid therapy. Comparison of the two groups was performed with matched t-test. RESULTS: A total of 125 episodes were analyzed. Before steroid treatment, 60 recurrences occurred, corresponding to a mean of 4.03  ± 4.22 (SD) relapses per year. After the first treatment with prednisone, patients experienced 47 relapses, representing a mean of 1.11  ± 1.27 (SD) relapses per year (p = 0.0371). CONCLUSIONS: Medical treatment with steroid reduces the duration and number of episodes. It also prevents the need for invasive breast surgery.

23072926|t|Oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme values in lymphomonocytes after an oral unsaturated fat load test in familial hypercholesterolemic subjects.
23072926|a|Oxidative stress (OS) has been observed in conditions affecting the cardiovascular system. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is associated with an increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. In the postprandial state, circulating lipids and lipoproteins can modulate OS status. Our aim was to study the response of lymphomonocyte OS status and reactive oxygen species by-products after an oral unsaturated fat load test (OFLT) in those with FH and to compare this response with that obtained in normolipidemic, normoglycemic subjects. We studied 12 patients with FH and 20 healthy controls. In both groups, lymphomonocyte, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio, and malondialdehyde were determined at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after an OFLT. Fasting urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and isoprostane were measured using standard procedures. In both groups, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde significantly decreased in the postprandial state after the OFLT. Both parameters were significantly higher in the FH group at baseline and during all the postprandial points, but the reduction from the baseline levels was significantly higher in the FH group than in the control group. Urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine was significantly increased in the FH group compared with the healthy control group, indicating a higher fasting OS status. We conclude that subjects with FH exhibited OS levels that were higher than in controls before and after an OFLT, but the improvement in the OS status after the unsaturated fat load was significantly higher in subjects with FH.

11725911|t|Enalapril acts through release of nitric oxide in patients with essential hypertension.
11725911|a|BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction has been proposed as an etiological agent in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. Amongst the various antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been implicated in modifying the vascular endothelium by the release of mediators that include bradykinin, nitric oxide, prostaglandins and thromboxane A2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the mechanism of action of enalapril, an ACEI, serum reactive nitrite intermediates (RNI) and citrulline, by products of nitric oxide metabolism were measured before and after treatment with enalapril in 25 consecutive patients of essential hypertension. RESULTS: Following treatment serum RNI intermediate increased from a pretreatment value of 164.5 +/- 20.2 nmol/mL to a post treatment value of 266.9 +/- 47.3 nmol/mL (p < 0.05), however there was no significant change in the levels of citrulline (p > 0.1). There was no significant correlation between the severity of hypertension and serum RNI. Serum RNI levels were lower in the postmenopausal women but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that enalapril exhibits its antihypertensive property through release of nitric oxide.

16463835|t|Cerebral blood flow augmentation in patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage.
16463835|a|Following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), cerebral blood flow (CBF) may be reduced, resulting in poor outcome due to cerebral ischaemia and subsequent stroke. Hypertonic saline (HS) is known to be effective in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP). We have previously shown a 20-50% increase in CBF in ischaemic regions after intravenous infusion of HS. This study aims to determine the effect of HS on CBF augmentation, substrate delivery and metabolism. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP), ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), brain tissue oxygen (PbO2), middle cerebral artery flow velocity (FV), and microdialysis was performed in 14 poor grade SAH patients. Patients were given an infusion of 23.5% HS, and quantified xenon computerised tomography scanning (XeCT) was carried out before and after the infusion in 9 patients. The results showed a significant increase in ABP, CPP, FV and PbO2, and a significant decrease in ICP (p < 0.05). Nine patients showed a decrease in lactate-pyruvate ratio at 60 minutes following HS infusion. These results show that HS safely and effectively augments CBF in patients with poor grade SAH and significantly improves cerebral oxygenation. An improvement in cerebral metabolic status in terms of lactate-pyruvate ratio is also associated with HS infusion.

1326224|t|Intensive etoposide and carboplatin chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. A phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.
1326224|a|From April 2 to July 9, 1989, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a Phase II study of etoposide and carboplatin in advanced (AJC Stage IIIb-IV) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose performance status (PS) was 0-2. The combination was given at the maximum tolerated dose as defined in a prior CALGB study. Of 76 eligible patients with follow-up data, complete responses were achieved in three patients (4%) and partial responses, in five patients (7%). One patient (1%) with evaluable disease showed improvement. There was only one partial response in the PS 2 patients. Performance status was a predictive factor for response or improvement (p = 0.0368). A high incidence (74%) of severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity and fatal sepsis in four patients was a reflection of the intensity of the chemotherapeutic regime. The median survival from study entry was 7.4 months. Thirty-seven percent of the patients survived beyond 1 year; the median survival for the PS 0-1 patients was 11.7 months for the PS 2 patients, 4.1 months. Median time to treatment failure was 3.9 months, but treatment had not failed in 9% of the patients after 1 year, all of whom were PS 0-1 at time of study entry. Although the response rate with this dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen was disappointing, the median survival of PS 0-1 patients was equivalent to that of Stage III NSCLC patients in prior CALGB studies. In patients with NSCLC who are treated with chemotherapy, PS may be as important a prognostic factor as stage, when median survival is used as an endpoint.

11573509|t|Gallium diffusion in human root dentin: quantitative measurements by pulsed Nd:YAG laser ablation combined with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.
11573509|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to determine if gallium nitrate placed in human root canals would diffuse across root dentin and reach concentrations high enough to inhibit osteoclasts (approximately 10(-4) M). BACKGROUND DATA: External root resorption by osteoclasts is a common sequela of dental trauma. If not detected and treated, it can lead to the loss of a tooth. Gallium has recently been reported to inhibit osteoclastic resorption in vitro. METHODS: Roots were cleaned and shaped using standard endodontic procedures and the tips sealed with cyanoacrylate cement. The root canal space was filled with an aqueous solution of 1.0 M gallium nitrate chelated with 1.0 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.2). The roots were then sectioned longitudinally into two equal halves. Each half was fixed to a translation stage that moved at a constant rate beneath a frequency-quadrupled Nd-YAG laser (266 nm) laser that was used to sample the concentration of 43Ca, 69Ga, and 71Ga by laser ablation across the thickness of root dentin to the periodontal surface. The plume of ablated dentin was swept into an inductively heated plasma chamber by argon gas and hence into a mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Quantitative analyses of the distribution of gallium showed it was highest adjacent to the root canal space and fell as more peripheral sites were sampled but then rose slightly at the external boundary of the root which is covered with a thin layer of atubular cementum. CONCLUSIONS: Even the lowest concentrations of gallium found in peripheral root dentin exceeded the 10(-4) M concentration required to inhibit osteoclastic activity. This simple endodontic treatment should undergo clinical trials to determine its efficacy in vivo. The laser ablation, inductively coupled mass spectrometry method is a powerful analytic tool for measuring spatial distribution of materials in mineralized tissues.

15563444|t|Dietary intake and the risk of coronary heart disease among the coconut-consuming Minangkabau in West Sumatra, Indonesia.
15563444|a|Several nutrition and non-nutritional pathways are recognised in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. However, several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut, a source of saturated fat. A case-control study was conducted among the Minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between the coronary cases and their gender- and age-matched apparently healthy counterparts serving as controls. Eligible subjects with CHD were identified through the co-operation of five participating hospitals located in Padang and Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 93 eligible cases (62 men and 31 women) in the Case group and 189 subjects (113 men and 76 women) in the Control group were recruited. Information on the intakes of individual foods and dishes over the preceding 12 months was obtained using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Case groups had significantly higher intakes of meats, eggs, sugar, tea, coffee and fruits, but lower intakes of soy products, rice and cereals compared to the controls. Coconut consumption as flesh or milk was not different between cases and controls. The cases had significantly higher intakes of protein and cholesterol, but lower intake of carbohydrate. Similar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat, including that from coconut, was not a predictor for CHD in this food culture. However, the intakes of animal foods, total protein, dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of CHD.

24377601|t|Knockdown of MDR1 increases the sensitivity to adriamycin in drug resistant gastric cancer cells.
24377601|a|Gastric cancer is one of the most frequently occurring malignancies in the world. Development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy is known as the major cause of treatment failure for gastric cancer. Multiple drug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/p-gp) contributes to drug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps and is overexpressed in many solid tumors including gastric cancer. To investigate the role of MDR1 knockdown on drug resistance reversal, we knocked down MDR1 expression using shRNA in drug resistant gastric cancer cells and examined the consequences with regard to adriamycin (ADR) accumulation and drug- sensitivity. Two shRNAs efficiently inhibited mRNA and protein expression of MDR1 in SGC7901-MDR1 cells. MDR1 knockdown obviously decreased the ADR accumulation in cells and increased the sensitivity to ADR treatment. Together, our results revealed a crucial role of MDR1 in drug resistance and confirmed that MDR1 knockdown could reverse this phenotype in gastric cancer cells.

11839383|t|Arsenic trioxide and methylprednisolone use different signal transduction pathways in leukemic differentiation.
11839383|a|Certain cell lines like HL 60 and K 562 are utilised as leukemic cell models for leukemogenesis research, which differentiate along the granulocytic and/or monocytic pathway when treated with certain inducer molecules. High dose methylprednisolone treatment has been shown to induce in vivo and in vitro differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells to mature granulocytes in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been confirmed to have remission induction effects on APL. However, there are conflicting results on the effects with other AML subtypes. Also, it has been well established that the reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a major regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction pathways that control cell growth and differentiation. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) are major components of phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated the effect of As(2)O(3) on HL 60 and K 562 myeloid leukemic differentiation and compared the signalling cascades of the two inducers with respect to serine/threonine PP 1 and 2A. We utilised PP1 and PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. In contrast to methylprednisolone, there was no effect of phosphatase inhibitors on As(2)O(3)-induced leukemic differentiation. Incomplete leukemic differentiation occurred with lower As(2)O(3) concentration as 10(-6)M. Unlike As(2)O(3), methylprednisolone induced complete granulocytic and/or monocytic differentiation of HL 60 and K 562 cells via upregulation of PP2A regulatory subunits. Therefore, As(2)O(3) and methylprednisolone are promising agents that have the potential to be used together in myeloid leukemic differentiation therapy.

15673502|t|Alternative treatments for Clostridium difficile disease: what really works?
15673502|a|Vancomycin and metronidazole have been used for treating Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) for the past 25 years, but approximately 20 % of patients develop recurrent disease. The increasing incidence of nosocomial outbreaks, cases of recurrent CDAD and other complications (toxic megacolon, ileus, sepsis) has fuelled the search for different types of treatments. As the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease has matured, newer treatment strategies that take advantage of these mechanisms have been developed. This review will describe such treatments and examine the evidence for each strategy.

11384951|t|Measures of maternal tobacco exposure and infant birth weight at term.
11384951|a|This study was undertaken to determine the relation between self-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day and urine cotinine concentration during pregnancy and to examine the relations between these two measures of tobacco exposure and birth weight. Data were obtained from the Smoking Cessation in Pregnancy project, conducted between 1987 and 1991. Cigarette smoking information and urine cotinine concentration were collected for 3,395 self-reported smokers who were receiving prenatal care at public clinics in three US states (Colorado, Maryland, and Missouri) and who delivered term infants. General linear models were used to quantify urine cotinine variability explained by the number of cigarettes smoked per day and to generate mean adjusted birth weights for women with different levels of tobacco exposure. Self-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day explained only 13.9% of the variability in urine cotinine concentration. Birth weight declined as tobacco exposure increased; however, the relation was not linear. The sharpest declines in birth weight occurred at low levels of exposure. Furthermore, urine cotinine concentration did not explain more variability in birth weight than did number of cigarettes smoked. These findings should be considered by researchers studying the effects of smoking reduction on birth outcomes.

20632462|t|Associations between markers of inflammation and physiological and pharmacological levels of circulating sex hormones in postmenopausal women.
20632462|a|OBJECTIVE: Hormone therapy has been shown to reduce markers of vascular inflammation in . C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of generalized inflammation, is raised by oral estradiol therapy (ET). It is not known how sex hormone concentrations relate to the markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women taking or not taking hormone therapy. METHODS: This observational study includes postmenopausal women participating in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. Multiple measures of serum sex hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin(SHBG) levels from 107 postmenopausal women taking oral ET and 109 taking placebo for 2 years were correlated with markers of inflammation over the same time period using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were significantly inversely associated with estrone(P = 0.05), total and free estradiol (P = 0.008 and 0.02, respectively), and SHBG (P = 0.03) only among oral ET users. Serum homocysteine levels were also inversely associated with estrone (P = 0.001) and total and free estradiol (P = 0.0006 and 0.0009, respectively) in ET-treated women only. No such associations were observed among women taking placebo. CRP was positively associated with estrogens and SHBG among women taking oral ET but inversely associated with SHBG among the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse associations of estrogens with soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and homocysteine support an anti-inflammatory property of estrogen, which was observed only at pharmacological levels in postmenopausal women. The positive associations between estrogens and CRP in the ET-treated women can be explained by the first-pass hepatic effect rather than a proinflammatory response.

21763368|t|Dual independent delivery of pro-angiogenic growth factors from starPEG-heparin hydrogels.
21763368|a|Effective vascularization is a prerequisite for the success of various different tissue engineering concepts. While simultaneous administration of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been previously demonstrated to boost angiogenesis, the combined long-term delivery of both growth factors from biomaterials is still a major challenge. In this work, two important heparin binding cytokines were delivered in parallel from a modular starPEG (multi-armed polyethylene glycol)--heparin hydrogel system to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown in culture and in a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. As the utilized gels contain high quantities of heparin, loading and subsequent release of both growth factors (as determined by radiolabeling studies and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA]) occurred independently from each other. The combined delivery of FGF-2 and VEGF through starPEG-heparin hydrogels resulted in pro-angiogenic effects in vitro (study of cell survival/proliferation, morphology and migration) and in vivo (quantification of CAM vascularization) being clearly superior over those of the administration of single factors. Consequently, the independent delivery of growth factor combinations by biohybrid starPEG-heparin matrices allows for the precise multifactorial control of cellular processes critically determining regeneration.

12032673|t|Induction of apoptosis by nitric oxide in macrophages is independent of apoptotic volume decrease.
12032673|a|Apoptosis occurs through a sequence of specific biochemical and morphological alterations that define the progress of cell death. The changes of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, the apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and the activation of caspases have been measured in RAW 264.7, HeLa and Jurkat T cells incubated with molecules that induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Our data show that NO, staurosporine, etoposide and camptothecin increased DeltaPsi(m) in macrophages but not in HeLa and Jurkat cells, that exhibited a DeltaPsi(m) decrease. Moreover, the apoptosis induced by NO in macrophages, but not that promoted by staurosporine, might occur in the absence of AVD. Analysis of the sequence of apoptotic manifestations shows that DeltaPsi(m) precedes AVD and caspase activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Inhibition of AVD abrogates apoptosis in HeLa and Jurkat T cells regardless of the stimuli used. These data suggest that the changes of DeltaPsi(m) are cell-type dependent and that AVD is dispensable for apoptosis in macrophages.

11124749|t|The coffee diterpene cafestol increases plasma triacylglycerol by increasing the production rate of large VLDL apolipoprotein B in healthy normolipidemic subjects.
11124749|a|BACKGROUND: Cafestol is a diterpene in unfiltered coffee that raises plasma triacylglycerol in humans. OBJECTIVE: We studied whether cafestol increases plasma triacylglycerol by increasing the production rate or by decreasing the fractional catabolic rate of VLDL(1) [Svedberg flotation unit (S(f)) 60-400] apolipoprotein (apo) B. In addition, we studied the effect of cafestol on the composition of VLDL(1) and VLDL(2) (S(f) 20-60). DESIGN: Eight healthy normolipidemic men were administered a daily dose of 75 mg cafestol for 2 wk. A bolus injection of 7 mg L-[5,5,5-(2)H(3)]leucine/kg body wt was given after a baseline period with no cafestol and again after treatment with cafestol. We derived kinetic constants to describe the metabolism of VLDL(1) apo B by using a multicompartmental model. RESULTS: Cafestol significantly increased plasma triacylglycerol by 31% or 0.32 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.03, 0.61); the increase was due mainly to a nonsignificant rise in VLDL(1) triacylglycerol of 57% or 0.23 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.02, 0.48). Cafestol significantly increased the mean rate of VLDL(1) apo B production by 80% or 755 mg/d (95% CI: 0.2, 5353), whereas it did not significantly change the mean fractional catabolic rate of VLDL(1) apo B (mean increase of 3 pools/d; 95% CI: -4, 10]). Cafestol did not change the composition of VLDL(1). A significant increase in the ratio of VLDL(2) cholesteryl ester to triacylglycerol indicates that VLDL(2) became enriched with cholesteryl esters at the cost of triacylglycerol. CONCLUSION: Cafestol increases plasma triacylglycerol by increasing the production rate of VLDL(1) apo B, probably via increased assembly of VLDL(1) in the liver.

9799818|t|Utility of biochemical markers of bone turnover in the follow-up of patients treated with bisphosphonates.
9799818|a|Biochemical markers of bone turnover are often measured in patients treated with antiresorptive agents to monitor the effects of therapy. In order for a change in these markers to clearly indicate treatment effect, the change in the markers must exceed the amount of spontaneous variation typically seen with no treatment. Based on the measured long-term variability of markers in untreated patients, we defined a minimum significant change (MSC), that is, a change that was sufficiently large that it was unlikely to be due to spontaneous variability. We also examined the changes in markers of bone turnover in subjects treated with pamidronate to see how often observed changes in turnover after treatment exceeded the MSC. We found that urinary markers of bone resorption are best measured on 2-hour fasting samples, because results on random urine showed poor precision and less decline with therapy. We also found that of all the markers, urinary N-telopeptide cross-links (NTX) had the greatest decline after therapy (58%), although it also had the highest long-term variability (29.5%). The marker that most often showed a decline with treatment that exceeded the MSC was serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase where 74% of observed changes exceeded the MSC. Other markers that often showed a decline with treatment that exceeded the MSC were 2-hour fasting urine NTX and free deoxypyridinoline, where 57% and 48%, respectively, of changes in therapy exceeded the MSC. The ideal marker would combine the large decline after treatment characteristic of NTX (60-70%) with the good precision of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.

1661723|t|Inhaled PAF stimulates leukotriene and thromboxane A2 production in humans.
1661723|a|Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent bronchoconstrictor in humans and has been implicated as an inflammatory mediator in asthma. This study was performed to evaluate whether PAF-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo could be mediated through the release of the bronchoconstrictor eicosanoids, thromboxane (Tx) A2 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Ten asthmatic subjects were studied on three occasions after bronchial challenges with aerosolized PAF, methacholine, or isotonic saline. PAF caused bronchoconstriction in all 10 subjects (mean maximal percent fall in specific airway conductance 48.2 +/- 4.6) and was matched by methacholine challenge. Saline caused no changes in specific airway conductance. Urinary leukotriene E4 was significantly elevated after inhaled PAF (366.0 +/- 66.9 ng/mmol creatinine, P less than 0.01) compared with methacholine (41.6 +/- 13.3) and saline (33.6 +/- 4.6). The major urinary TxA2 metabolite 2,3-dinor TxB2 was elevated after inhaled PAF (41.3 +/- 7.1 ng/mmol creatinine, P less than 0.01) compared with methacholine (14.0 +/- 2.7) and saline (17.1 +/- 3.9). Urinary 2,3-dinor 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha after PAF (22.2 +/- 1.4) was raised with respect to the methacholine challenge (13.9 +/- 1.8, P less than 0.02), although no significant increase was observed compared with the saline control (18.6 +/- 3.3). Inhaled PAF leads to the secondary generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes and TxA2, and it is possible that these mediate some of the acute effects of inhaled PAF in vivo.

22368898|t|Efficacy and safety of quinine loading dose in patients with severe falciparum malaria at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan.
22368898|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of a loading dose regimen of quinine with a uniform dose regimen in patients with severe falciparum malaria. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 315 patients admitted with severe falciparum malaria and treated with quinine at a tertiary care teaching hospital of Karachi, Pakistan during 1999-2006 was conducted. Group A with 103 patients (32.7%) was given an initial loading dose of quinine while group B with 212 patients (67.3%) did not receive the loading dose. The two groups were compared in terms of reduction of parasite load, resolution of fever, recovery of consciousness and incidence of adverse effects. Outcome parameters were measured on the third day of therapy. RESULTS: More individuals in group A (62.1%) were afebrile as compared to group B (54.7%) at day 3 of therapy. Patients in group B showed greater reduction in parasitaemia (47.2% at baseline to 4.7% on day 3) as compared to group A (56.3 % at baseline to 9.7% on day 3). Following therapy, fewer patients in group B had altered consciousness (7.1% at baseline to 4.7% on day 3) as compared to patients in group A (7.8% at baseline to 5.8% on day 3). However, these associations were not statistically significant. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in Group A (5.8%) as compared to Group B (0.9%). CONCLUSION: Although quinine loading dose may be more effective than uniform dose in rapid fever clearance; it also appears to be associated with higher toxicity. Uniform dose of quinine may be prescribed in severe falciparum malaria in view of its better safety profile.

7824238|t|The impact of a policy of amnioinfusion for meconium-stained amniotic fluid.
7824238|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an amnioinfusion (AI) policy for thick or moderate meconium-stained amniotic fluid (AF) on neonatal outcome, specifically meconium-aspiration syndrome and its complications. METHODS: We reviewed maternal and neonatal charts of 937 vertex, singleton pregnancies complicated by moderate or thick meconium-stained AF during a 3-year period. The patients were divided into groups according to whether AI was performed. Demographic characteristics, risk factors, mode of delivery, pregnancy outcome, and neonatal complications, including meconium-aspiration syndrome, were analyzed. RESULTS: Four hundred forty patients (47%) received AI (AI group); 497 (53%) did not, for the following reasons: imminent delivery (310 patients), occult meconium (141), or emergency cesarean delivery (46) (no-AI group). Our study did not show any reduction in the incidence of 5-minute Apgar scores of 7 or less (8 versus 7%), meconium below the vocal cords (28 versus 29%), meconium aspiration syndrome (4.5 versus 3.8%), ventilation requirement (4.3 versus 2.4%), or neonatal death (0.7 versus 0.2%) in the AI and no-AI groups, respectively. The AI group had a higher incidence of fetal heart rate abnormalities in labor (48 versus 31%, P < .05), instrumental delivery (15 versus 8%, P < .05), cesarean delivery (28 versus 17%, P < .001), and endometritis (21 versus 13%, P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: With the policy of routine AI for moderate or thick meconium-stained AF, AI was not clinically feasible in 53% of the cases. We were unable to demonstrate any improvement in neonatal outcome in those who received AI for moderate or thick meconium.

22912337|t|Ah receptor antagonism represses head and neck tumor cell aggressive phenotype.
22912337|a|The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been shown to play a role in an increasing number of cellular processes. Recent reports have linked the AhR to cell proliferation, cytoskeletal arrangement, and tumor invasiveness in various tumor cell types. The AhR plays a role in the de-repression of the interleukin (IL)6 promoter in certain tumor cell lines, allowing for increased transcriptional activation by cytokines. Here, we show that there is a significant level of constitutive activation of the AhR in cells isolated from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Constitutive activation of the AhR in HNSCCs was blocked by antagonist treatment, leading to a reduction in IL6 expression. In addition, the AhR exhibits a high level of expression in HNSCCs than in normal keratinocytes. These findings led to the hypothesis that the basal AhR activity in HNSCCs plays a role in the aggressive phenotype of these tumors and that antagonist treatment could mitigate this phenotype. This study provides evidence that antagonism of the AhR in HNSCC tumor cells, in the absence of exogenous receptor ligands, has a significant effect on tumor cell phenotype. Treatment of these cell lines with the AhR antagonists 6, 2', 4'-trimethoxyflavone, or the more potent GNF351, decreased migration and invasion of HNSCC cells and prevented benzo[a]pyrene-mediated induction of the chemotherapy efflux protein ABCG2. Thus, an AhR antagonist treatment has been shown to have therapeutic potential in HNSCCs through a reduction in aggressive cell phenotype.

21455855|t|Multiple myeloma, venous thromboembolism, and treatment-related risk of thrombosis.
21455855|a|Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease with a high prevalence in elderly people, affecting > 5% of the population > 65 years of age. Cancer patients have a 4.3-fold higher incidence of thrombotic complications, due to multiple risk factors that are not always related to the disease. Among hematologic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) confers a high risk of developing such complications, with a VTE rate of nearly 10%. Multiple factors are involved in MM-related VTE, such as increased blood viscosity, high levels of immunoglobulin, procoagulant activity of monoclonal protein, and inflammatory cytokines. Since the introduction of the immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic armamentarium of MM, VTE has emerged as one of the leading complications, in particular in patients with newly diagnosed MM. In this setting, IMiDs-based treatments are associated with rates of VTE reaching values up to 14 to 26%, particularly when dexamethasone or chemotherapy are added. The optimal prophylaxis for patients receiving these antiangiogenetic agents is still a matter of debate. Due to the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, different studies have used various anticoagulant prophylaxes, including fixed low-dose warfarin (1 mg or 1.25 mg), therapeutic doses of warfarin (international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0), low molecular weight heparin, or low-dose aspirin. As yet, no study has clearly demonstrated a significant superiority of one prophylactic regimen in comparison with the others. Further investigation and more randomized clinical trials are needed to define the best thromboprophylaxis.

22731240|t|Dexamethasone versus ondansetron in combination with dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of postoperative vomiting in pediatric outpatients: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
22731240|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of postoperative vomiting (POV) in children submitted to outpatient surgery and to compare the efficacy of antiemetic drugs in preventing this complication. BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting are common in the immediate postoperative period following anesthetic and surgical procedures. Compared to adults, pediatric patients are more likely to develop postoperative nausea and vomiting, the incidence of which ranges from 8.9% to 42%. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 129 children. The participants were randomized into three prophylactic treatment groups: dexamethasone (n = 43), ondansetron in combination with dexamethasone (n = 44), and placebo (n = 42). The variables studied were the frequency of POV and the incidence of vomiting after the patient had been discharged from hospital, the need for antiemetic rescue therapy in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), need for hospitalization, and the time the patient remained in the PACU. A significance level of 5% was adopted. RESULTS: Postoperative vomiting occurred in 12.4% of the children, with no statistically significant difference between the groups: 6.8% in the group receiving ondansetron combined with dexamethasone, 14.3% in the placebo group, and 14% in the group that received dexamethasone alone (P = 0.47). Furthermore, no significant difference was found between the groups with respect to the time the children remained in the PACU, and only five patients reported having vomited following discharge from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic use of antiemetic drugs failed to reduce the incidence of POV in pediatric outpatient surgery with a low emetic potential; therefore, routine prophylaxis may be unnecessary.

7603759|t|Multi-centre collaborative study for the in vitro evaluation of new macrolides dirithromycin and erythromycylamine. Australian Group for Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
7603759|a|A national study was conducted to determine the in vitro activity of 2 newer macrolides, dirithromycin and erythromycylamine compared with that of erythromycin, tetracycline and penicillin. Nineteen major teaching hospitals participated in the study. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution, mostly using Iso-Sensitest Agar and an inoculum of 10(4) cells per spot. 2284 clinically significant strains were isolated in late 1991 and early 1992, comprising 1736 Gram-positive cocci, 355 Haemophilus influenzae, 97 Moraxella catarrhalis, 32 Listeria monocytogenes, 25 Neisseria meningitidis and 39 Neisseria gonorrhoeae were tested. The study indicates that dirithromycin and erythromycylamine possess antibacterial activity equivalent to that of erythromycin against most Gram-positive cocci and M. catarrhalis. Strains resistant to erythromycin were also resistant to dirithromycin and to erythromycylamine. Tetracycline was as active as the macrolides against both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase-negative penicillin-resistant staphylococci, compared with tetracycline, were relatively resistant to the macrolides. H. influenzae was less susceptible than the Gram-positive cocci.

7944163|a|The use of chemotherapeutic agents in high doses in the treatment of advanced-stage cancer enhances drug toxicity, and ocular complications are not uncommon. In this article, we discuss the ocular toxicity in six patients with advanced nonpretreated colorectal cancer who received megadoses of carmustine and mitomycin with the support of autologous bone marrow transplantation. The results obtained did not reveal any subjective or objective pathologic conditions of the ocular apparatus with particular attention to orthoptic examinations, the anterior segment, and the fundus. No patient had changes in visual acuity. Tonometry did not demonstrate significant variations. There were, however, qualitative and quantitative changes in the tear films of all patients, leading to damage to the corneal and conjunctival epithelium.

9146839|t|Cognitive effects of antipsychotic agents in persons with traumatic brain injury.
9146839|a|Over 1 million survivors of traumatic brain injury receive maintenance pharmacotherapy, of which a substantial number receive antipsychotic agents for the treatment of psychoses, agitation and aggression, and other maladaptive behaviours. In spite of the common clinical uses of antipsychotics, the cognitive risks versus benefits are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in cognitive functioning before, during, and after discontinuation of antipsychotic agents in inpatients undergoing rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychiatric tests (Reys Auditory-Verbal Learning, Trail Making A&B, Digit Span Forwards and Backward) evaluating cognitive skills of verbal ability, visuomotor speed, memory, learning, attention, and spatial ability were administered to each subject at baseline (immediately prior to tapering or discontinuing antipsychotic), when taper reached 50% of baseline dose, 1 week after antipsychotic discontinuation, and 3 weeks after discontinuation. These data suggest that select areas of cognition improve after antipsychotic discontinuation in subjects with traumatic brain injury. The magnitude of improvement appeared to be greater after discontinuation with thioridazine, a low-potency agent, compared to haloperidol, a high-potency agent. Results, although very preliminary, support the hypothesis of cholinergic involvement in regulating cognitive processes, and this underscores the need for more systematic research in this area.

22972055|t|Progestogens with or without oestrogen for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation.
22972055|a|BACKGROUND: Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens in the regulation of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases in February 2012: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. All authors were experts in the content of this review. MAIN RESULTS: No randomised trials were identified that compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with anovulation. There is no consensus about which regimens are most effective. Further research is needed to establish the role of these hormonal treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.

15611726|t|Choline transporters, cholinergic transmission and cognition.
15611726|a|Cholinergic projections to the cortex and hippocampus mediate fundamental cognitive processes. The capacity of the high-affinity choline uptake transporter (CHT) to import choline from the extracellular space to presynaptic terminals is essential for normal acetylcholine synthesis and therefore cholinergic transmission. The CHT is highly regulated, and the cellular mechanisms that modulate its capacity show considerable plasticity. Recent evidence links changes in CHT capacity with the ability to perform tasks that tax attentional processes and capacities. Abnormal regulation of CHT capacity might contribute to the cognitive impairments that are associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the CHT might represent a productive target for the development of new pharmacological treatments for these conditions.

10704936|t|Antioxidant action of the antihypertensive drug, carvedilol, against lipid peroxidation.
10704936|a|The action of carvedilol, a vasodilating, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, against lipid peroxidation has been the subject of many studies, but the results reported thus far are contradictory. In an attempt to define the antioxidant mechanism of carvedilol against lipid peroxidation, the dynamics of the action of carvedilol were studied in several oxidation systems. We investigated the reactivity of carvedilol toward radicals and its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation induced by several kinds of initiating species such as azo compounds and metal ions in solution, micelles, membranes, and low-density lipoprotein. Carvedilol exerted poor reactivity toward phenoxyl, alkoxyl, and peroxyl radicals in acetonitrile solution nor did it show an appreciable antioxidant effect against either the peroxyl radical-induced oxidation of methyl linoleate in acetonitrile or against phosphatidylcholine liposomal membranes in aqueous suspension. Carvedilol completely inhibited the ferric ion-induced oxidation of methyl linoleate micelles by sequestering ferric ions, but not by reducing hydroperoxide. It was shown that carvedilol enhanced the oxidation of micelles induced by either methemoglobin or peroxyl radical. Carvedilol, which was added exogenously, did not suppress the oxidation of isolated low-density lipoprotein induced by peroxyl radical or cupric ion. These results show that carvedilol does not act as a radical-scavenging antioxidant, but that it does act most efficiently as an antioxidant against ferric ion-induced oxidation by sequestering ferric ion.

24276039|t|Response of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with spinal cord metastasis to everolimus.
24276039|a|BACKGROUND: Brain subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in patients with tuberous sclerosis have been reported to respond to everolimus. METHODS: A 15-year-old male patient with intractable seizures and multiple SEGAs of the brain developed leptomeningeal enhancement and multiple metastatic, histologically confirmed SEGAs of the spinal cord. He received daily everolimus at a dose of 3 mg/m for 6 weeks, which was then increased to 6 mg/m. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance image of the brain and spine showed significant reduction in the size of SEGAs after 6 weeks of treatment. The patient has remained free of progression for 24 months. Additional benefits included: excellent seizure control, decrease in the size of cardiac rhabdomyomas, and improved quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a rare case of metastatic SEGA, which was successfully treated with everolimus.

8175280|t|The influence of UV irradiation on vitamin D metabolism in children with chronic renal diseases.
8175280|a|The aim of this study was to find out whether an improvement of vitamin D metabolism and its metabolites and a decrease of parathormones can be reached through a diet and UV irradiation. Forty-eight children with kidney insufficiency were divided into four groups: Group 1--diet according to BergstrÃ¶m with EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation plus UV therapy; Group 2--diet plus EAA and cetoanalogue supplementation without UV therapy; Group 3--without diet and supplementation of EAA and ceto but with UV therapy; Group 4--without any diet and without UV therapy. The average levels of kidney insufficiency in all children at the stage of a manifest kidney insufficiency were not significantly different. As a result it became obvious that children exposed to UV irradiation with or without a diet had better post-treatment values and that children with kidney insufficiency reacted to UV therapy plus diet best of all. One can obtain the same results also by oral vitamin D therapy, although we have to point out the danger of calcinosis and stone formation which the author could frequently demonstrate, but never after UV treatment.

23144172|t|AngiomiR-126 expression and secretion from circulating CD34(+) and CD14(+) PBMCs: role for proangiogenic effects and alterations in type 2 diabetics.
23144172|a|Several peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived cell populations can promote angiogenesis, and differences in CD34(+) or CD14(+) surface expression have been used to separate PBMC subpopulations in this respect. AngiomiRs, microRNAs regulating angiogenesis, are key regulators of angiogenic processes. The present study examines differential angiomiR expression/secretion from CD34(+)/CD14(+), CD34(+)/CD14(-), CD34(-)/CD14(+), and CD34(-)/CD14(-) PBMC subsets and their relevance for different proangiogenic properties. Notably, both circulating human CD34(+)/14(+) and CD34(+)/14(-) PBMC subsets and their supernatants exerted more potent proangiogenic effects compared with CD34(-) PBMC subsets. MiR-126 was identified as most differentially expressed angiomiR in CD34(+) compared with CD34(-) PBMC subsets, determined by miR-array and RT-PCR validation. Modulation of miR-126 by anti-miR-126 or miR-mimic-126 treatment resulted in significant loss or increase of proangiogenic effects of CD34(+) PBMCs. MiR-126 levels in supernatants of CD34(+) PBMC subsets were substantially higher compared with CD34(-) PBMC subsets. MiR-126 was secreted in microvesicles/exosomes, and inhibition of their release impaired CD34(+) PBMCs proangiogenic effects. Notably, high-glucose treatment or diabetes reduced miR-126 levels of CD34(+) PBMCs, associated with impaired proangiogenic properties that could be rescued by miR-mimic-126 treatment. The present findings provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying increased proangiogenic effects of CD34(+) PBMCs, that is, angiomiR-126 expression/secretion. Moreover, an alteration of angiomiR-126 expression in CD34(+) PBMCs in diabetes provides a novel pathway causing impaired proangiogenic effects.

12506022|t|Imatinib therapy for hypereosinophilic syndrome and other eosinophilic disorders.
12506022|a|Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule inhibitor of abl, kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and a rare eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloid disorder (eos-CMD) characterized by the t(5;12)(q33;p13) cytogenetic abnormality. In the current study, we sought to confirm the preliminary observations in HES as well as evaluate the therapeutic value of imatinib in eos-CMD that is not associated with t(5;12)(q33;p13). Five patients with HES (all men, median age = 46 years) and 2 with eos-CMD (both men, aged 45 and 58 years) were treated with imatinib at a starting dose of 100 to 400 mg/day. Cytogenetic studies showed no evidence of either the bcr-abl translocation or t(5;12)(q33;p13) in any patient. Screening of exons encoding the intracellular catalytic domains and extracellular ligand binding domains of PDGFR beta (exons 2-23) and c-kit (exons 1-21) in 6 patients demonstrated mostly previously known polymorphisms. At a median follow-up of 17 weeks (range, 10-33 weeks), 2 patients with HES and 1 with eos-CMD have achieved complete clinical remission and 1 additional patient with HES has achieved a partial remission. In contrast to previous observations, all 4 responding patients had elevated serum interleukin-5 levels. Although the drug was well tolerated in most patients, a previously unrecognized treatment toxicity of acute left ventricular dysfunction occurred in a responding patient with HES within the first week of treatment. Myocardial biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation, and the cardiogenic shock was reversed with the prompt institution of corticosteroid therapy.

11140730|a|Heterocyclic substituted derivatives of the antipsoriatic anthralin were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their antiproliferative action against keratinocytes and their ability to induce keratinocyte differentiation. The indole-2-carboxylic acid analogue 2e exhibited the same excellent antiproliferative activity as anthralin and also induced terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. As a benefit of its strongly diminished potential to generate oxygen radicals, 2e did not induce damage of keratinocyte membranes.

20555368|t|Vitamin and mineral supplementation effect on muscular activity and cycling efficiency in master athletes.
20555368|a|The influence of vitamin and mineral complex supplementation on muscular activity and cycling efficiency was examined in elderly endurance-trained master athletes during a heavy cycling trial. Master athletes were randomly assigned in a double-blind process to 1 of 2 treatment groups: antioxidant supplementation (n = 8: As group) or placebo (n = 8: Pl group) for 21 days. After that time, each subject had to perform a 10-min session of cycling on a cycloergometer at a heavy constant intensity. Twenty-four to 48 h after this session, subjects performed an isometric maximal voluntary contraction before and immediately after a fatiguing strength training (leg press exercise) and the same 10-min cycling test after fatigue. Isometric maximal voluntary force (MVF) of knee extensors was assessed before and after fatigue. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of the vastus medialis, the vastus lateralis (VL), and the biceps femoris was recorded with surface EMG. The knee-extensors MVF after the fatiguing exercise was reduced in similar proportions for both groups (As, -10.9%; Pl, -11.3%, p < 0.05). This MVF loss was associated with a significant reduction in EMG frequency parameters for both groups, with a lower decrease for the As group. Muscular activity and cycling efficiency during the cycling bouts were affected by the treatment. Cycling efficiency decreased significantly and the oxygen uptake slow component was higher after the fatiguing exercise for both groups. Furthermore, a decrease in cycling efficiency was associated with an increase in VL activity. However, these changes were significantly lower for the As group. The results of the present study indicate an overall positive effect of vitamin and mineral complex supplementation on cycling efficiency after fatigue, in the endurance-trained elderly.

11774397|t|A pilot study evaluating the safety and microbiologic efficacy of an economically viable antimicrobial lozenge in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy.
11774397|a|BACKGROUND: Mucositis occurs in almost all radiotherapy-treated head and neck cancer patients, in approximately 75% of patients receiving hematopoietic marrow transplantation, and in approximately 40% of all patients who receive chemotherapy. Mucositis is painful, may affect all oral functions, and is a dose- and rate-limiting toxicity of therapy for cancer. Radiation-associated mucositis (onset, intensity, and duration) has been shown in recent clinical trials to be modified by the use of antibacterial/antifungal lozenges. PURPOSE: The aim of this collaborative two-center phase II study was to assess the toxicity and microbiologic efficacy of an economically viable antimicrobial lozenge in the management of patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients scheduled to receive radical or postoperative radiotherapy were provided with bacitracin, clotrimazole, and gentamicin (BCoG) lozenges (one lozenge dissolved in the mouth qid from day 1 of radiotherapy until completion). Ease of use and palatability of the lozenges, patients' symptoms (swallowing and pain), and quantitative and qualitative microbiologic evaluation of an oral rinse collection was conducted at least once weekly during radiation therapy. RESULTS: No significant side effects were reported from the use of the lozenges. The lozenges were well tolerated at the beginning of treatment by all patients, with some minor difficulty associated with oral discomfort toward the end of the treatment. Microbiologic evaluation showed consistent elimination of yeast organisms in all patients. In four patients there was no growth of gram-negative bacilli on culture, whereas in two patients, fluctuating counts were seen, and one patient had increased counts. The remaining patients had significant reduction in the gram-negative bacilli counts. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the BCoG lozenge is tolerable and microbiologically efficacious, achieving elimination of Candida in all patients and reduction in gram-negative flora in most patients. A phase III study is underway to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this lozenge.

9075465|t|Positron emission tomography measurement of cerebral metabolic correlates of yohimbine administration in combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder.
9075465|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an increase in symptoms of anxiety in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following administration of the beta 2-antagonist yohimbine, which stimulates brain norepinephrine release. Preclinical studies show decreased metabolism in the neocortex and the caudate nucleus with high-dose yohimbine-induced norepinephrine release, but low levels of norepinephrine release result in an increase in metabolism in these areas. METHODS: We used positron emission tomography and fludeoxyglucose F 18 to measure brain metabolism in Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD (n = 10) and healthy age-matched control subjects (n = 10), following administration of yohimbine (0.4 mg/kg) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind fashion. RESULTS: Yohimbine resulted in a significant increase in anxiety in the patients with PTSD, but not in healthy subjects. There was a significant difference in brain metabolic response to yohimbine in patients with PTSD compared with healthy subjects in prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and orbitofrontal cortexes. Metabolism tended to decrease in patients with PTSD and increase in healthy subjects following administration of yohimbine. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with our previous hypothesis of enhanced norepinephrine release in the brain with yohimbine in patients with PTSD.

20921291|t|The effect of sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate on the pharmacokinetics of oral calcitriol.
20921291|a|BACKGROUND: Lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate are non-calcium-based phosphate binders used to manage hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD may require intravenous or oral active vitamin D. We investigated the effects of lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer carbonate on the bioavailability of oral calcitriol. METHODS: This was a three-period, crossover study in healthy volunteers. Forty-one individuals were randomized to one of six possible sequences, each consisting of three treatment periods separated by washouts. The treatments were calcitriol (1 µg at lunch), calcitriol with lanthanum carbonate (3000 mg/day) and calcitriol with sevelamer carbonate (7200 mg/day). Serum calcitriol levels were assessed at baseline and throughout the study. RESULTS: Co-administration of lanthanum carbonate with calcitriol had no significant effect on area under the curve over 48 h (AUC(0-48)) for serum exogenous calcitriol [least-squares (LS) mean, calcitriol with lanthanum carbonate vs calcitriol alone: 429 pg h/mL vs 318 pg h/mL, respectively; P = 0.171]. Similarly, there was no significant effect on maximum concentration (C(max)). In contrast, co-administration with sevelamer was associated with a significant reduction in bioavailability parameters for calcitriol (calcitriol with sevelamer carbonate vs calcitriol alone, LS mean AUC(0-48): 137 pg h/mL vs 318 pg h/mL, respectively; P = 0.024; LS mean C(max): 40.1 pg/mL vs 49.7 pg/mL, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer carbonate significantly reduces serum concentrations of exogenous calcitriol when administered concomitantly with oral calcitriol, whereas lanthanum carbonate has no significant effect. This should be considered when treating CKD patients who require phosphate binders and oral vitamin D.

25082359|t|Prognostic factors and historical trends in the epidemiology of candidemia in critically ill patients: an analysis of five multicenter studies sequentially conducted over a 9-year period.
25082359|a|PURPOSE: To describe temporal trends in the epidemiology, clinical management and outcome of candidemia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 1,392 episodes of candidemia in 647 adult ICU patients from 22 Brazilian hospitals. The characteristics of candidemia in these ICU patients were compared in two periods (2003-2007, period 1; 2008-2012, period 2), and the predictors of 30-day mortality were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who developed candidemia while in the ICU increased from 44 % in period 1 to 50.9 % in period 2 (p = 0.01). Prior exposure to fluconazole before candidemia (22.3 vs. 11.6 %, p < 0.001) and fungemia due to Candida glabrata (13.1 vs. 7.8 %, p = 0.03) were more frequent in period 2, as was the proportion of patients receiving an echinocandin as primary therapy (18.0 vs. 5.9 %, p < 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate decreased from 76.4 % in period 1 to 60.8 % in period 2 (p < 0.001). Predictors of 30-day mortality by multivariate analysis were older age, period 1, treatment with corticosteroids and higher APACHE II score, while treatment with an echinocandin were associated with a higher probability of survival. CONCLUSIONS: We found a clear change in the epidemiology and clinical management of candidemia in ICU patients over the 9-year period of the study. The use of echinocandins as primary therapy for candidemia appears to be associated with better outcomes.

10590214|t|Effects of the rodent peroxisome proliferator and hepatocarcinogen, perfluorooctanoic acid, on apoptosis in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.
10590214|a|The effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a potent hepatocarcinogen and peroxisome proliferator in rodents, on human cells have not yet been examined. In the present study we demonstrate that treatment of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells with PFOA induces apoptosis, as well as perturbs the cell cycle. This apoptosis was characterized by electron microscopy, which revealed typical nucleosomal fragmentation (also observed as a 'DNA ladder' upon electrophoresis on agarose) and was quantitated using propidium iodide staining of cellular DNA and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. This process was dose- and time-dependent: apoptosis became manifest with 200 microM and maximal (45% of the cells) upon exposure to 450 microM PFOA for 24 h. Electrophoresis of the DNA from HepG2 cells exposed to 500 microM PFOA for 24 h or to 400 microM PFOA for 48 h revealed a smear typical of non-specific degradation. These findings indicate that in the presence of high concentrations of PFOA for long times, HepG2 cells undergo primary and secondary necrosis. Quantitation of trypan blue exclusion supported this conclusion. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the cell cycle of HepG2 cells was perturbed by exposure to 50-150 microM PFOA. A 50 microM concentration resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of G(2)/M cells and, simultaneously, a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase, whereas treatment with 100 or 150 microM PFOA increased the proportion of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and decreased the number of cells in the G(2)/M and S phases. Simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis-associated DNA strand breaks using the TUNEL procedure and of propidium iodide staining of cellular DNA revealed DNA breaks in HepG2 cells exposed to 150 microM PFOA, prior to nuclear fragmentation.

11915582|t|Surgical or medical treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: a cost-benefit analysis.
11915582|a|With the availability of laparoscopic ovarian cautery, there has been a resurgence in interest in the surgical treatment of clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Comparison of ovulation and pregnancy rates has found no difference in success rates between ovarian cautery and gonadotropin ovulation induction for such women. We have therefore compared the cost of laparoscopic ovarian cautery with that of a typical cycle of gonadotropin ovulation induction, and also found that there is little difference. Because of the potential advantages of ovarian cautery, we recommend this surgery as the next line of treatment if clomiphene citrate fails to induce ovulation in PCOS patients, before gonadotropins are introduced.

22830980|t|Metabolism and disposition of [14C]n-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate in male and female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats following oral administration and dermal application.
22830980|a|n-Butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (n-butylparaben, BPB) is an antioxidant used in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. This study investigated the disposition of ring-labelled [(14)C]BPB in Harlan Sprague Dawley rats, and in rat and human hepatocytes. BPB was rapidly cleared in hepatocytes from rat (t(1/2) = 3-4 min) and human (t(1/2) = 20-30 min). The major metabolites detected in rat hepatocytes were hydroxybenzoic acid and in human hepatocytes were hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxyhippuric acid. [(14)C]BPB was administered to male rats orally at 10, 100 or 1000 mg/kg, intravenously at 10 mg/kg and dermally at 10 and 100 mg/kg; female rats were administered oral doses at 10 mg/kg. Oral doses of BPB were well-absorbed (>83%) and eliminated chiefly in urine (83-84%);  <= 1% of the radioactivity remained in tissues at 24 h or 72 h after dosing. About 4% and 8%, respectively, of 100 mg/kg dermal doses were absorbed in 24 h and 72 h, and about 50% of a 10 mg/kg dose was absorbed in 72 h. Metabolites detected in urine included those previously reported, BPB-glucuronide, BPB-sulfate, hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxyhippuric acid, but also novel metabolites arising from ring hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation and sulfation.

20651460|t|Difructose anhydride III enhances bioavailability of water-insoluble iron in anemic Vietnamese women.
20651460|a|Difructose anhydride III (DFAIII) is an indigestible disaccharide and has been shown to enhance iron absorption in animal studies; however, the effect has not been investigated in anemic subjects. We investigated the efficacy of co-administration of DFAIII with water-insoluble iron in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in Vietnamese women. One hundred sixty-eight moderately anemic women (80 g/L<hemoglobin (Hb)<120 g/L) participated in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study with daily supplementation of iron for 6 mo. The volunteers were randomly assigned into four groups, i.e., Group A: received 15 mg Fe as ferric pyrophosphate; Group B: received 15 mg Fe as ferric pyrophosphate and 1.25 g DFAIII; Group C: received 15 mg Fe as ferrous sulfate; Group D: received a placebo. Hb and iron status were measured at baseline and after 2, 4 and 6 mo of intervention. The ratio of transferrin receptor to ferritin was used to estimate stored and functional body iron (BI). One hundred sixteen (69.0%) women completed the trial. After 6 mo, mean (+/-SE) Hb concentration was higher in Group A (121.6+/-1.7 g/L), Group B (126.4+/-1.5 g/L) and Group C (126.8+/-1.6 g/L) compared to Group D (107.0+/-1.7 g/L, p<0.0001). Mean change in BI was twofold greater in Group B (5.0+/-0.5 mg/kg) than that in Group A (2.5+/-0.6 mg/kg, p=0.008). The percentage of anemia was significantly reduced in Group B (18.8%) compared to Group D (95.8%, p<0.0001) and Group A (39.1%, p=0.033). Co-administration of DFAIII enhances Hb concentration and iron stores more than single administration of water-insoluble iron in anemic Vietnamese women.

8328496|t|Fludarabine therapy in WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia.
8328496|a|PURPOSE: To assess the response rate, remission duration, and survival of patients with WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia treated with the adenine nucleoside analogue fludarabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia, of whom only 2 were previously untreated, received fludarabine at a dose of 20 to 30 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days (20 patients) or 30 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 3 days (8 patients). Treatment was continued until maximum response was achieved. Responding patients were followed with no further treatment until relapse. RESULTS: Ten patients responded (36%), including the 2 previously untreated patients and 8 of 26 patients (31%) who were resistant to prior therapies. Unmaintained remissions lasted for a median of 38 months. There were no fatalities associated with this treatment. Previously untreated patients and those with a primary resistant disease of relatively short duration were more likely to benefit from this treatment. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine is an effective salvage agent for the treatment of patients with resistant WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia. Further investigations of fludarabine in untreated patients and in combination with other active agents are warranted.

17152227|t|The association between copper containing IUCD and bacterial vaginosis.
17152227|a|This study was designed to investigate whether there is an association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the use of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD). Six hundred Papanicolaou stained cervicovaginal smears were analyzed cytologically. 56 of 600 patients (9.3%) were detected as having IUCD. Four of 56 (7,1%) and 10 of 544 (1.8%) were positive for BV [Bv (+)]. The duration of the use of IUCD was higher than 4 years in 3 of 4 patients who were BV (+). This study showed a significant correlation between the use of IUCD and the presence of BV statistically (p < 0.05). Our findings also suggest that time limited BV infection is associated with long term use of this device. It can be suggested that a periodic microscopic examination and use of IUCD (less than 5 years) are convenient to prevent this kind of anaerobic infection.

23670807|t|Cerebellar anaplastic astrocytoma in an adult with neurofibromatosis type 1: case report and review of literature.
23670807|a|BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas (e.g., pilocytic astrocytomas) are frequently found in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Whereas most of those lesions are located supratentorially, cerebellar manifestations are described in < 1%. Malignant variants like glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) are only rarely observed in NF1 patients. Thus, cerebellar AA is very infrequent and has not yet been described in an adult NF1 patient. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with von Recklinghausen disease who had a diffuse contrast-enhancing cerebellar mass that was resected guided by aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-fluorescence. Histopathological analyses revealed an AA with lack of pilocytic features or O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation. Due to the proximity of the tumor to the brainstem, adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy was administered rather than first-line radiotherapy. Although the patient recovered quickly after the operation and tumor progression was ruled out in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patient strongly deteriorated during a 16-month follow-up, and MRI revealed severe leukoencephalopathy. Extensive electrophysiological and radiological examination revealed a neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Finally, the patient's condition improved receiving levodopa. CONCLUSIONS: A literature search yielded only one previously published case of an AA in a 9-year-old girl with NF1. Tumor control after resection was achieved in both patients; however, the patient in the mentioned report received radiation instead of temozolomide. In spite of different adjuvant therapies, tumor control for at least 16 months was achieved in both published cases. Thus, even though the role of adjuvant treatment options remains to be further elucidated, surgery is the appropriate therapy in these uncommon tumors providing mass reduction and histological diagnosis as well as tumor control.

7697699|t|The mode of action of sumatriptan is vascular? A debate.
7697699|a|Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the primary mode of action of sumatriptan: vasoconstriction, and trigeminal nerve terminal inhibition. Sumatriptan is a potent vasoconstrictor of intracranial arteries. It has been shown to increase blood flow velocity in large intracranial arteries in man in a dose-dependent fashion both during and between migraine attacks. Since the vasoconstrictor response of sumatriptan is reproducible outside the migraine attack, this action appears to be a direct vascular effect and not indirectly mediated via neural mechanisms. Sumatriptan also causes rapid constriction of dural and meningeal vessels in vivo. It does not modify cerebral blood flow but does constrict arterio-venous anastamoses that may be dilated during a migraine attack. This evidence suggests that sumatriptan has a direct, dose-related, vasoconstrictor action on certain intracranial blood vessels that correlates with its antimigraine activity. Alternatively, sumatriptan may act directly on the trigeminal sensory nerve terminals within the cranial blood vessel, inhibiting the release of sensory neuropeptides. Experimental data from animal studies have shown that following electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion there is a neurogenic inflammatory response with plasma protein extravasation from dural blood vessels. This response can be significantly reduced by sumatriptan at a dose level similar to that used in clinical treatment. This finding is further supported by the clinical observation that sumatriptan reduces the plasma levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide which are raised during a migraine attack.

22104575|t|Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate estimation by Cockcroft-Gault, Jelliffe, Wright and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulae in oncology patients.
22104575|a|BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the accuracy of Cockcroft-Gault, Jelliffe, Wright and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulae as a substitute for the gold standard measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using chromium 51 EDTA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of GFR measurements in oncology patients from a University Teaching Hospital over 3 years was carried out. Bias and precision of estimates of GFR were compared with measured GFR. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty patients with measured GFR (median 90 ml/min, range 23-179 ml/min) were identified. Cockcroft-Gault produced the smallest bias (median percentage error -1.4%) and highest precision (median absolute percentage error 14.0%) and was the most accurate for carboplatin dosing. For patients>30% over their ideal body weight (IBW), using IBW+30% in the Cockcroft-Gault formula was more precise than using actual body weight or IBW. The Wright formula was most accurate for patients aged 70+years and patients with a body mass index (BMI)>= 30 but overestimated GFR when GFR<50 ml/min. CONCLUSIONS: When measured GFR is unavailable, we advise estimating GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and using IBW+30% for patients weighing>30% over their IBW. If the GFR is >= 50 ml/min and the patient is >70 years and/or BMI>= 30, the Wright formula gives the best estimate of GFR.

8940747|t|Adenosine physiology and pharmacology: how about A2 receptors?
8940747|a|Adenosine participates in the physiology of central and peripheral tissues through several subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors. Positively linked to adenylate cyclase, A2 receptors have been subdivided into A2a and A2b sites on the basis of their molecular, biochemical and pharmacological properties. They exhibit selective distribution, and are implicated in the modulation of psychomotor activity, circulation, respiration, and metabolism. Recent data support the evidence that adenosine A2 receptor properties may prove useful in future drug development, and selective manipulation of receptor-associated biologic effects might be relevant in the treatment of various disorders, including psychiatric diseases, hypoxia/ischemia, inflammation or erythrocytosis.

21107309|t|Genome-wide pharmacogenomic study of neurocognition as an indicator of antipsychotic treatment response in schizophrenia.
21107309|a|Neurocognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and, therefore, represent potentially critical outcome variables for assessing antipsychotic treatment response. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 738 patients with schizophrenia from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study. Outcome variables consisted of a neurocognitive battery administered at multiple time points over an 18-month period, measuring processing speed, verbal memory, vigilance, reasoning, and working memory domains. Genetic mediation of improvements in each of these five domains plus a composite neurocognitive measure was assessed for each of five antipsychotics (olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone). Six SNPs achieved genome-wide significance using a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 1 in 10 findings is a false discovery. These six SNPs were located within, or in close proximity to, genes EHF, SLC26A9, DRD2, GPR137B, CHST8, and IL1A. The more robust findings, that is those significant across multiple neurocognitive domains and having adjacent SNPs showing evidence for association, were rs286913 at the EHF gene (p-value 6.99 × 10(-8), q-value 0.034, mediating the effects of ziprasidone on vigilance), rs11240594 at SLC26A9 (p-value 1.4 × 10(-7), q-value 0.068, mediating the effects of olanzapine on processing speed), and rs11677416 at IL1A (p-value 6.67 × 10(-7), q-value 0.081, mediating the effects of olanzapine on working memory). This study has generated several novel candidate genes for antipsychotic response. However, our findings will require replication and functional validation. To facilitate replication efforts, we provide all GWAS p-values for download.

16352333|a|OBJECTIVES: There is a greater than 7-fold increased risk of uterine cancer in women with breast cancer exposed to tamoxifen. The objective of this study was to determine the percentage of women who developed uterine cancer more than 12 months after discontinuing tamoxifen (past users) and to compare their clinical and pathologic features with those of women who developed uterine cancer while on tamoxifen therapy or within 12 months of stopping therapy (recent users). METHODS: All women with a diagnosis of uterine cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1980 and June 2004 with a past history of breast cancer treated with tamoxifen were identified. Clinical and pathologic data were obtained through retrospective chart review. RESULTS: There were 106 women identified with a history of breast cancer treated with tamoxifen preceding their diagnosis of uterine cancer. Thirty-nine (37%) developed uterine cancer more than 12 months after discontinuing tamoxifen. The median time until developing uterine cancer in past users was 33 months (range, 13-22). There were no significant differences in age at breast cancer diagnosis, body mass index, parity, stage of breast cancer, modality of breast cancer treatment, or duration of tamoxifen therapy between past and recent users of tamoxifen. Women who were past users of tamoxifen had significantly more FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) grade 3 and non-endometrioid histologic subtypes (P = 0.009; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of women treated with tamoxifen develop uterine cancer more than 12 months after discontinuing therapy. These women are at greater risk of developing moderately to poorly differentiated tumors, which is a known poor prognostic factor. Therefore, women with a past history of tamoxifen therapy should have continued surveillance after completion of tamoxifen to ensure early diagnosis of uterine cancer.

17765048|t|Efficacy of short-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis.
17765048|a|PURPOSE: There is little consensus on the most appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. The goal of this study is to systematically review randomized controlled trials comparing short-course and extended-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL, and reviewed reference lists from 1980 through June 2006. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials that compared short-course (7 days or less) versus extended-course (>7 days) antibiotic monotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The primary outcome measure was failure to achieve clinical improvement. RESULTS: We found 15 randomized controlled trials matching our inclusion and exclusion criteria comprising 2796 total subjects. Short-course regimens primarily studied the use of azithromycin (n=10), but trials examining beta-lactams (n=2), fluoroquinolones (n=2), and ketolides (n=1) were found as well. Of the extended-course regimens, 3 studies utilized the same antibiotic, whereas 9 involved an antibiotic of the same class. Overall, there was no difference in the risk of clinical failure between the short-course and extended-course regimens (0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.02). In addition, there were no differences in the risk of mortality (0.81, 95% CI, 0.46-1.43) or bacteriologic eradication (1.11, 95% CI, 0.76-1.62). In subgroup analyses, there was a trend toward favorable clinical efficacy for the short-course regimens in all antibiotic classes (range of relative risk, 0.88-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: The available studies suggest that adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia can be safely and effectively treated with an antibiotic regimen of 7 days or less. Reduction in patient exposure to antibiotics may limit the increasing rates of antimicrobial drug resistance, decrease cost, and improve patient adherence and tolerability.

16169135|t|A physiologically based toxicokinetic model of inhalation exposure to xylenes in Caucasian men.
16169135|a|Widespread exposure to the volatile aromatic hydrocarbons, ortho-, meta-, and para-xylene occurs in many industries including the manufacture of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic fibers. This paper describes the development of a physiologically based toxicokinetic model using biomonitoring data to quantify the kinetics of ortho-, meta-, and para-xylenes. Serial blood concentrations of deuterium-labeled xylene isomers were obtained over 4 days after 37 controlled, 2h inhalation exposures to different concentrations of the isomers. Peak toxicant concentrations in blood occurred in all subjects at the termination of exposure. Systemic clearance averaged 116 L/h+/-34 L/h, 117 L/h+/-23 L/h, and 129 L/h+/-33 L/h for ortho-, para-, and meta-xylene, respectively. The half-life of each toxicant in the terminal phase (>90 h post-exposure) was fit by the model, yielding values of 30.3+/-10.2 h for para-xylene, 33.0+/-11.7 h for meta-xylene and 38.5+/-18.2 h for ortho-xylene. Significant isomeric differences were found (p<0.05) for toxicant half-life, clearance and extrahepatic metabolism. Inter-individual variability seen in this study suggests that airborne concentration guidelines may not protect all workers. A Biological Exposure Index is preferred for this purpose since it is integrative and reflective of inter-individual kinetic variability.

16340225|t|Pyo-pneumothorax in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis: an analysis of 17 cases without intrapleural fibrinolytic treatment.
16340225|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the medical records of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and pyo-pneumothorax (PPT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 17 patients (14 male, 3 female, mean age 23.8 years, range 20-52) with PPT and active pulmonary tuberculosis at Gulhane Military Medical Academia Haydarpasa Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, were reviewed from January 1998 to December 2002. The patients were treated with chest tube drainage and chemotherapy. Intrapleural fibrinolytic agents or irrigation was not performed. RESULTS: Pleural fluid samples were available in 14 patients and the mean levels of LDH, protein and glucose in the pleural fluid were 1,767 +/- 944 U/l, 5.2 +/- 1.4 g/dl and 31.7 +/- 22.6 mg/dl, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in the pleural effusion of 3 patients. The duration of chest tube drainage was longer in cases who underwent open drainage (p = 0.014). At the end of the treatment period 10 patients developed pleural thickening, 4 of them underwent decortication and pneumonectomy was also done in 1 patient. The development of pleural thickening was related to the level of pleural fluid glucose (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This study shows that while taking care of patients with pulmonary TB the physician must be aware of the complication of PPT and that adequate chemotherapy and drainage must be duly performed.

10546490|t|Effectiveness of treatment of severe tinea pedis with 1% terbinafine cream in members of the Japanese self-defense forces.
10546490|a|A clinical study was conducted to determine the efficacy of terbinafine cream in severe cases of tinea pedis. The subjects were 21 men, members of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces who were judged to have severe symptoms of tinea pedis. The description 'severe' was defined as 'considered to require the concurrent internal administration of antifungals for complete cure', or as meeting criterion 5 or 6 for the severity of tinea pedis. A simple surface application of terbinafine cream was given once daily, the subjects' clinical manifestations, mycological cure rates and safety-related changes were observed, and a final assessment was made in the 12th week. In the final assessment, the improvement rate of the cutaneous symptoms was 95.2%, and the fungal eradication and efficacy rates were 81.0%. As for side-effects, one patient complained of local irritation. These results suggested that terbinafine cream is a beneficial topical antifungal cream for severe tinea pedis.

1971452|t|Evidence for cell type dependent mechanisms in agonist-induced down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors.
1971452|a|Processing of the beta-adrenoceptors by mammalian tumor cells, Chang liver cells and HeLa cells both containing beta-2-adrenoceptors, was studied using 125I-labeled iodocyanopindolol and 3H-labeled CGP12177. No difference could be detected between the results obtained with these two ligands. During desensitization of these cells by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol a time dependent decrease of intracellular cyclic-AMP was accompanied by loss of beta-adrenoceptors. The loss of receptors could not be prevented by the cytoskeleton disrupting agents colchicine and cytochalasin B. The effect of the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine is dependent upon the cell type. It showed no effect on the agonist-induced down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on Chang liver cells in contrast to a prominent inhibiting effect on HeLa cells. These results highly suggest that lysosomal enzymes are involved in the process of down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on certain cell types only. Colchicine and cytochalasin B, as well as Gpp(NH)p were able to uncouple the guanine nucleotide binding protein and the beta-adrenoceptor. This uncoupling however, did not inhibit the loss of receptors measured by radioligand binding techniques during challenge with agonists. From experiments performed to separate membrane fractions on non-linear sucrose gradients it cannot be concluded that receptors are redistributed intracellular or in the plane of the membrane. Withdrawal of the agonist during receptor down-regulation resulted in the reappearance of measurable receptors within 20 hr for receptors on HeLa cells and within 60 hr for Chang liver cells. The reappearance of receptors could be totally blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that these receptors were newly synthesized and not internalized receptors. From the results of our experiments it is concluded that beta-adrenoceptors, present on Chang liver cells and HeLa cells are down-regulated during desensitization by isoproterenol without uptake in intracellular structures of the cells. The fate of these down-regulated receptors remains unclear. It is also concluded that no universal mechanism can be proposed for beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation on mammalian cells.

24529474|t|Preparation of polysaccharide derivates chitosan-graft-poly(É-caprolactone) amphiphilic copolymer micelles for 5-fluorouracil drug delivery.
24529474|a|Biodegradable graft copolymer, chitosan-graft-poly(É-caprolactone) (CS-g-PCL) was synthesized via ring opening polymerization and characterized by (1)H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Then graft copolymers were self-assembled into micelles as drug delivery system. To evaluate drug-polymer compatibility, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter between 5-fluorouraci (5-Fu) and hydrophobic segment was calculated. The result was in agreement with experimental data from drug loading content and drug loading efficiency. Meanwhile, DLS and TEM were utilized to evaluate the trend of particle size and morphology in aqueous solution with different repeating units of É-CL. The in vitro drug release data was fitted with three kinetic models, usually applied in the drug delivery system. Results indicated that the release of 5-Fu was controllable and the release half-time could reach as long as 54.46 h, much slower than that of free 5-Fu. Cytotoxicity evaluation and cellular apoptosis study suggested good biocompatibility of CS-g-PCL micelles. Moreover, 5-Fu loaded micelles could delay the release of drug and exert comparable cytotoxicity against A549 cells.

24080801|t|Vasculitis syndromes: RAVE about rituximab in ANCA vasculitis?
24080801|a|Follow-up data from the RAVE trial have shown that rituximab is as effective as immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis. Rituximab is likely to become the standard of care for many patients with ANCA disease. However, an individualized approach is needed to identify those who require more-intense or prolonged therapy.

23811468|t|Review on the demographic and social impact of methadone-medication therapy on Malaysian patients.
23811468|a|This study is an observational cross-sectional study aimed to examine the possible demographic and social characteristics of patients enrolled at the Methadone Maintenance Therapy Adherence Clinic (MMTAC) in Malaysia. Medical records from year 2009 - 2011 were Reviewed. Demographic, social characteristics and laboratory examinations such as age, gender, race, clinic attendances and urine analysis were recorded. Subjects were selected by means of convenient sampling but based on the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were analyzed by either Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test Mann-Whitney U-test, with the limit of significance was set at p < 0.05. Demographically, this study found that the ratio of Malays, Chinese and Indian enrolled to the MMTAC program is similar to the distribution of races in Malaysia. Their starting age for drug use was between 14-35 years and the age to enrolment between 30-58 years. Socially, many are unemployed, lowly educated and married. Most are drug users with a high percentage of HCV accompanied with impaired liver function. Retention rate was 87% but illicit drug use was at 57.50%. However, percentage of employment increased significantly after therapy. The study managed to identify several demographical and social distributions of patients attending the MMTAC. Although attendance rate was high, many were on illicit drug use. Nevertheless, employment rate improved significantly.

12903886|t|The effect of supplemental enteral glutamine on plasma levels, gut function, and outcome in severe burns: a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
12903886|a|BACKGROUND: This research was conducted to evaluate the effect of enterally administered glutamine (gln) dipeptide on metabolic, gastrointestinal, and outcome parameters after severe burn injury. METHODS: Forty thermally injured patients with total body surface burns ranging between 50% and 80%, and third-degree burns ranging between 20% and 40% and without respiratory injuries, were randomized into a prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. One group received gln-enriched enteral nutrition and the other group received the standard enteral formulation. Tube feedings were initiated on postburn day 1 (PBD +1), and isocaloric and isonitrogenous feedings were administered to both groups until PBD +12. The gln was given as the dipeptide of alanyl-gln (Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan), which provided 0.35 g gln/kg body weight/d. Plasma amino acid profiles, serum endotoxin concentrations, and the lactulose/mannitol absorption ratio (which reflects gut permeability) were measured at specific times throughout the clinical course. Wound healing at day 30 was assessed, and length of hospital stay and total costs were determined at discharge. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in terms of age and extent of injury. Plasma gln concentrations were approximately 300 umol/L in both groups on PBD +1 and remained low in the control group (399 +/- 40 umol/L, mean +/- SD) but increased toward normal in the supplemented group to 591 +/- 74 (p = .048). Lactulose/mannitol ratios were increased above normal on POD +1 (control, 0.221 +/- 0.169; gln, 0.268 +/- 0.202; not significant), reflecting increased intestinal permeability after burn injury. On POD +3, the ratio in the gln group was lower than control (0.025 +/- 0.008 versus 0.049 +/- 0.016; p = .0001), and both groups returned toward normal ratios with time. Endotoxin levels on PBD +1 were elevated in both groups (control, 0.089 +/- 0.023 EU/mL; gln, 0.103 +/- 0.037 EU/mL; NS) but decreased significantly on PBD +3 in the patients receiving gln. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the gln group than controls (67 +/- 4 days versus 73 +/- 6; p = .026). On day 30, wound healing was 86% +/- 2% complete in the gln group compared with 72% +/- 3% in controls (p = .041). Total cost of hospitalization was 62794 +/- 6178 RMB (dollar 7593 +/- 747 US dollars) in the gln group and 68996 +/- 8620RMB (dollar 8343 +/- 1042, p = .031) in controls, although the cost of the enteral nutrition was higher in the gln-supplemented patients. CONCLUSION: Enteral gln supplementation using a commercially available dipeptide supported plasma gln levels, improved gut permeability, and initially decreased plasma endotoxin levels in severely thermally injured patients. These alterations were associated with a reduction in the length of hospitalization and lower costs.

22777150|t|Roxithromycin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.
22777150|a|This case report highlights a very rare adverse drug reaction of oral roxithromycin causing toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). A 54-year-old male patient diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection was prescribed oral roxithromycin 150 mg twice daily for 7 days. On the 10th day, the patient was admitted to the emergency with sore throat, redness, watering of eyes, painful micturition, and severe skin lesions. The skin lesions were multiple, severely painful, burning, coalesced, and filled with fluid-producing large blisters appearing on the lip, face, and trunk and then gradually spreading to legs, arms, palms, hands, and feet extensively involving much >30% of body surface area. Clinical examination, blood investigation, and histopathological examination of the skin confirmed the diagnosis of TEN. There was no history of any concomitant medications, drug allergy, burn injury, recent graft, or transplant or any coexisting infections such as herpes simplex. Other resembling skin diseases were eliminated after proper dermatological examination. This episode of TEN was probably drug (roxithromycin) induced. The drug was immediately stopped, and the patient was treated meticulously resulting in gradual reversal of the diseased state. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale suggested the likelihood that oral administration of roxithromycin was responsible for the TEN was 'probable.'

22727544|t|Innate immune responses to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in immunocompromised pediatric patients and the effect of taurolidine.
22727544|a|BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging pathogen causing invasive infections in immunocompromised pediatric patients, including neonates and pediatric oncology patients. Information on innate immune responses to S. maltophilia and its potential modulation are scarce. METHODS: We established an in vitro S. maltophilia whole blood sepsis model and studied the proinflammatory cytokine production of CD14-positive cells by flow cytometry. We compared the cytokine expression of term newborns (n = 13) and healthy adults (n = 10) and investigated in vitro responses of pediatric oncology patients after recovery from neutropenia (n = 10) with healthy adults (n = 10). We further evaluated the immunomodulatory role of the amino-acid derivative taurolidine in our in vitro sepsis model. RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokine responses to S. maltophilia were largely diminished in the neonatal population. No remarkable differences were noted for cytokine responses between pediatric oncology patients and healthy controls. Taurolidine inhibited immunoglobulin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in a dose dependent-fashion in both, pediatric oncology patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Deficient immune responses to S. maltophilia require optimized prevention strategies against infection in immunocompromised patients, including neonates.

19343300|t|Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
19343300|a|Elderly and poor performance status advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often tolerate chemotherapy poorly. Special approaches are needed for these patient populations. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erlotinib and gefitinib, are active agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Several phase II trials have been conducted utilizing EGFR TKIs in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced NSCLC. This review will summarize the results of erlotinib or gefitinib in these subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC.

16622447|t|A phase II study of vinflunine in bladder cancer patients progressing after first-line platinum-containing regimen.
16622447|a|A multicentre phase II trial to determine the efficacy of vinflunine as second-line therapy in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder; secondary objectives were to assess duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and to evaluate the toxicity associated with this treatment. Patients had tumours that failed or progressed after first-line platinum-containing regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, or had progressive disease after platinum-containing chemotherapy given with adjuvant or neoadjuvant intent. Response and adverse events were assessed according to WHO criteria and NCI-CTC (version 2), respectively. Out of 51 patients treated with 320 mg m(-2) of vinflunine, nine patients responded to the therapy yielding an overall response rate of 18% (95% CI: 8.4-30.9%), and 67% (95%CI: 52.1-79.3%) achieved disease control (PR+SD). Of note, responses were seen in patients with relatively poor prognostic factors such as a short (<12 months) interval from prior platinum therapy (19%, including an 11% response rate in those progressing <3 months after platinum treatment), prior treatment for metastatic disease (24%), prior treatment with vinca alkaloids (14%) and visceral involvement (20%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-15.0) and the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.4-3.8). The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.8-7.6). The main haematological toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, observed in 67% of patients (42% of cycles). Febrile neutropenia was observed in five patients (10%) and among them two were fatal. Constipation was frequently observed (but was manageable and noncumulative) and was grade 3-4 in only 8% of patients. The incidence of grade 3 nausea and vomiting was very low (4 and 6% of patients, respectively). Neither grade 3-4 sensory neuropathy nor severe venous irritation was observed. Moreover, and of importance in this particular study population, no grade 3-4 renal function impairment was observed. Vinflunine is an active agent for the treatment of platinum-pretreated bladder cancer, and these results warrant further investigation in phase III trials, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents as treatment of advanced/metastatic TCC of the bladder.

23474447|t|Methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone allergic contact dermatitis and the effect of patch test concentration.
23474447|a|BACKGROUND: The isothiazolinones methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) are the active ingredients in a frequently used preservative in cosmetic, household, and industrial products. OBJECTIVES: This study reviewed our department's cases of allergic contact dermatitis caused by MCI/MI, outlining their clinical presentation and possible sources of sensitization. The effect of changing the concentration of MCI/MI from 0.01% to 0.02% in the British Society for Cutaneous Allergy baseline series was also measured. METHODS: A total of 964 patients were patch tested to the British Society for Cutaneous Allergy baseline series in our department over 4 years. Patients were tested either to 0.01% MCI/MI (697) or 0.02% MCI/MI (267). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (2.2%) had positive reactions to MCI/MI. Of patients tested to 0.02% MCI/MI, 3.8% had a positive reaction compared with 1.6% of those tested to MCI/MI 0.01%. Ten patients (48%) had perianal dermatitis; of these, 50% had used moist toilet wipes. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight MCI/MI as important contact allergens found in moist toilet wipes and should be considered particularly in patients with facial, hand, and perianal allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing to 0.01% MCI/MI may underestimate its allergenic potential, missing more than half of allergic cases compared with testing to 0.02%. To identify isothiazolinone allergy, we recommend that 0.02% MCI/MI should be used in baseline series.

8245900|t|Treatment of varicella in the immunocompetent adult.
8245900|a|Varicella in the immunocompetent adult is an infrequent but potentially serious infection. Previous studies in immunocompetent hosts and normal adults have demonstrated the value of intravenous acyclovir in the treatment of varicella-zoster virus infections. Oral acyclovir has also shown efficacy in both normal adults with zoster (shingles) and immunocompetent children with varicella. A recently completed double-blind placebo-controlled study of oral acyclovir in immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated varicella also demonstrated efficacy. Therapy within the first day reduced the time to 100% crusting of skin lesions from 7.4 to 5.6 days, and reduced the duration of fever by one-half day. Symptoms were also diminished. These benefits were observed only when therapy was initiated within 24 hours of the appearance of the rash. Adults with complicated varicella (usually symptomatic varicella pneumonia) should receive intravenous acyclovir. Several new agents for varicella-zoster therapy are being evaluated; brovavir is a new agent currently being compared to placebo in the treatment of adult varicella.

18318674|t|The effects of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on IVH-PVh of premature infants.
18318674|a|Intraventricular-periventricular hemorrhage (IVH-PVH) is the most frequent type of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants and the major cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children too. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of prenatal corticosteroid treatment on the incidence of IVH-PVH in premature infants. The study enrolled 163 prematures of 26-34 weeks' gestation. They have been divided into two groups: the experimental group (80/163), who have been treated with corticosteroids prenatally and control group (83/163), who have not received such treatment. There is statistically significant difference in IVH-PVH incidence between the experimental group (18/80) and control group (32/83) (chi2 =5,616, p<0,05). There is no statistically significant difference in Apgar score after 5 minutes between the experimental group and control group of IVH-PVH prematures, t= 0,121. There is no statistically significant difference in mean gestation age between the experimental group (30,74 weeks) and control group (29,97 weeks) of IVH-PVH prematures, t= 1,299. There is no statistically significant difference in mean birth weight between the experimental group (1479,44 grams) and control group (1379,37 grams) of IVH-PVH prematures, t= 0,913. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment of premature infants reduced the incidence of IVH-PVH significantly. There is no statistically significant difference in Apgar score after 5 minutes, mean gestation age and mean birth weight between the experimental and control group of IVH PVH prematures.

17911198|a|Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among young men aged 15 to 35 years. Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin remains the mainstay of treatment. We present a 27-year-old man who presented with an acute anterior myocardial infarction during the second course of chemotherapy for seminoma. Because the patient had no significant risk factors for coronary heart disease, the infarction was likely caused by the chemotherapy regimen.

9711681|t|Testosterone delivery systems for women: present status and future promise.
9711681|a|In women, testosterone (T) is increasingly recognized as a steroid with multiple non-reproductive effects. Testosterone deficiency in menopausal women is more common than appreciated, particularly in patients on hormone replacement or with surgical menopause. Replacement of T is an established therapy for male hypogonadism, and as a result innovative new delivery systems have evolved to optimize physiologic delivery. However, in women, modalities of T replacement remain underdeveloped and at present provide artificial and/or supraphysiologic androgen levels. This review discusses the androgen replacement modalities presently available for women, and those being developed for future use.

11113486|t|Dissociating nicotine and nonnicotine components of cigarette smoking.
11113486|a|To dissociate the sensorimotor aspects of cigarette smoking from the pharmacologic effects of nicotine, smokers rated the subjective effects of nicotine-containing or denicotinized cigarettes, and intravenous (IV) nicotine or saline infusions. Three groups of participants (n=20 per group) received either: (1) continuous nicotine, (2) pulsed nicotine, or (3) saline. Each group was exposed to an IV condition once while smoking a denicotinized cigarette and once while not smoking, in a 3x2 mixed design. A fourth group (n=20) received saline while smoking their usual brand of cigarette. The dose and rate of nicotine administration were individualized based on previous measures of ad lib smoke intake. Denicotinized cigarette smoke significantly reduced craving and was rated significantly more satisfying and rewarding than the no-smoking conditions. IV nicotine reduced craving for cigarettes, and increased ratings of lightheadedness and dizziness. However, no significant satisfaction or reward was reported after IV nicotine. The combination of IV nicotine and denicotinized cigarette smoke produced effects similar to those of smoking the usual brand of cigarette. The results suggest that sensorimotor factors are critical in mediating the immediate subjective response to smoking, and that the immediate subjective effects of nicotine administered in doses obtained from cigarette smoking are subtle. Thus, addressing smokers' needs for both for the sensorimotor aspects of smoking as well as for the direct CNS effects of nicotine may be critical in enhancing smoking cessation treatment outcome.

1432533|t|Meconium ileus-like condition in Chinese neonates.
1432533|a|Between January 1985 and May 1990, 16 neonates were treated for meconium ileus (MI) at this hospital. All babies were born to Chinese couples. Seven of them were premature, but none of them weighed less than 1,000 g. Eight patients underwent operations either because of mistaken diagnosis, as ileal atresia or long-segment Hirschsprung's disease, or because of complicated MI, including two meconium peritonitis and one associated with ileal atresia. Gastrograffin enema was successful in management of eight uncomplicated MI. The albumin content in the meconium of the last nine cases, including four complicated cases, ranged from 9.2 to 93.3 mg/g dry meconium. Usually, albumin is not present in normal meconium. All cases received sweat test, which were negative. Three patients died in the follow-up period. Sepsis of unknown origin, multiple congenital anomalies, and severe metabolic problems were the causes of death. The other 13 patients are doing well. They have exhibited no pulmonary or digestive problems during their follow-up period, which ranged from 11 months to 5 years. They are healthy and receive regular diets. Growth and development are appropriate for their age groups.

23684045|t|Prevalence and clinical correlations of catatonia in older adults referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital.
23684045|a|AIM: To determine the frequency and clinical correlations of catatonia in older patients referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients over 65 years referred to liaison psychiatry were screened for catatonic phenomena with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI) between January and May 2012. Their clinical characteristics and the outcome of treatment were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients over 65 years were referred. Ten (8.9%) met research diagnostic criteria for catatonia and 7 (6.3%) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria for catatonia. All patients presented with the inhibited variant and 5 to 12 catatonic signs. Three patients presented concomitant delirium. The etiology of catatonia was multifactorial, and complications and death were frequent (40% and 20%, respectively). Lorazepam achieved full resolution of catatonia in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Catatonia in older adults referred to liaison psychiatry in a general hospital is not infrequent and has a multifactorial etiology. The BFCSI is a simple and reliable instrument to detect catatonia in this population. Lorazepam seems to be an effective treatment.

10471386|t|Effects of exogenous nitric oxide and hyperoxia on lung fibroblast viability and DNA fragmentation.
10471386|a|Effective lung repair after acute injury requires elimination of proliferating mesenchymal and inflammatory cells without inducing an acute inflammatory response or disturbing concomitant repair of lung microvasculature. Previous studies have shown that endogenous NO regulates programmed cell death in fibroblasts and can modulate wound fibroblast synthetic function. We hypothesized that exposure of human lung fibroblasts to NO gas would decrease viability and induce apoptotic cell death. Primary cultures of normal human lung fibroblasts were exposed for 4 h to room air (RA), 80% oxygen, NO (at either 20 or 50 ppm) blended with RA, or NO blended with 80% O(2), then incubated for 24 to 72 h. Cell viability was determined by fluorescence viability/cytotoxicity assay and DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay. Peroxynitrite formation was assessed using immunoblotting for S-nitrosotyrosine. NO plus O(2) induced significant cell death at 20 and 50 ppm NO when compared to either RA or O(2) alone at both 24 and 72 h (p < 0.05). Incubation with superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) or SOD + CAT significantly decreased cell death in fibroblasts treated with NO(20)/O(2) and NO(50)/O(2) compared with controls (p < 0.05). NO(20)/O(2) and NO(50)/O(2) exposure significantly increased TUNEL mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), consistent with increased DNA fragmentation, compared to RA at 24 and 72 h (p < 0.05). Antioxidants decreased MFI in cells exposed to NO(20)/O(2) (CAT and SOD + CAT) compared to controls at 24 h (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis for S-nitrosotyrosine showed increased signal intensity in fibroblasts exposed to NO at 20 and 50 ppm plus O(2) compared to RA or O(2) alone. Incubation with SOD + CAT reduced signal intensity for peroxynitrite in cells exposed to NO(20)/O(2). We conclude that NO in hyperoxic conditions induces fibroblast cell death and DNA fragmentation, which could be partially mediated by peroxynitrite synthesis.

15628873|t|Redefining the facilitated transport of mannose in human cells: absence of a glucose-insensitive, high-affinity facilitated mannose transport system.
15628873|a|Current evidence suggests that extracellular mannose can be transported intracellularly and utilized for glycoprotein synthesis; however, the identity and the functional characteristics of the transporters of mannose are controversial. Although the glucose transporters are capable of transporting mannose, it has been postulated that the entry of mannose in mammalian cells is mediated by a transporter that is insensitive to glucose [Panneerselvam, K., and Freeze, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9417-9421] or by a transporter induced by cell treatment with metformin [Shang, J., and Lehrman, M. A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9703-9712]. We performed a detailed analysis of the uptake of mannose in normal human erythrocytes and in leukemia cell line HL-60. Short uptake assays allowed the identification of a single functional activity involved in mannose uptake in both cell types, with a K(m) for transport of 6 mM. Transport was inhibited in a competitive manner by classical glucose transporter substrates. Similarly, the glucose transporter inhibitors cytochalasin B, genistein, and myricetin inhibited mannose transport by 100%. Using long uptake experiments, we identified a second, high-affinity component associated with the intracellular trapping of mannose in the HL-60 cells that is not directly involved in the transport of mannose via the glucose transporters. Thus, the transport of mannose via glucose transporters is a process which is kinetically and biologically separable from its intracellular trapping. A general survey of human cells revealed that mannose uptake was entirely blocked by concentrations of cytochalasin B that obliterates the activity of the glucose transporters. The transport and inhibition data demonstrate that extracellular mannose, whose physiological concentration is in the micromolar range, enters cells in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose. Overall, our data indicate that transport through the glucose transporter is the main mechanism by which human cells acquire mannose.

8996853|t|Pharmacokinetic characteristics of a new liquid sustained-release formulation of theophylline designed for the elderly and children: microcaps as sachet.
8996853|a|A new sustained-release theophylline formulation was especially designed for the elderly and children. Microcapsules of theophylline, administered as a suspension in water, proved to be a suitable dosage form for a clientele with impaired or difficult deglutition. Pharmacokinetic characteristics of 2 batches at the lower (T1) and the upper (T2) in vitro dissolution specification range of this new formulation and a pellet formulation (R) as a comparator were evaluated in an open, randomized, 3-way, multiple-dose, crossover study design with an asymmetric dosage regimen of 400 mg and 200 mg theophylline. Smooth and safe plasma concentrations with a high and long-lasting plateau were achieved with this new formulation. Plateau times which are independent of the asymmetric dosage regimen ranged from 16.4 hours (T1) to 13.8 hours (T2) and could therefore span sufficient time of the dosage interval. Maximum serum levels of 9.6 micrograms/ml and 10.0 micrograms/ml were attained 6.6 and 6.1 hours after dosing of T1 and T2, coinciding perfectly with the time of the critical morning dip at 2-4 a.m. With a nocturnal excess of 15.5% (T1) and 17.9% (T2) this circadian-tailored asymmetric dosage regimen proved to take into account the chronopathology of asthma and the chronopharmacokinetics of theophylline sustained-release preparations. Bioequivalence of all 3 formulations versus each other with regard to rate (Cmaxss) and extent (AUC(tau)ss) of absorption could be established for the 2 batches at the upper and lower in vitro specification range and for both batches of the new formulation compared to the reference. All in all, safety and efficacy of this new liquid prolonged-release theophylline could be established. Furthermore, in vitro specifications could be justified according to current EU guidelines.

21875451|t|A large outbreak of scombroid fish poisoning associated with eating yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) at a military mass catering in Dakar, Senegal.
21875451|a|On 26 November 2010, an outbreak of scombroid fish poisoning occurred in the French Armed Forces in Dakar, Senegal. This chemical intoxication, due to high histamine concentration in fish, is often mistaken for an allergic reaction. A case-control study was undertaken including the 71 cases and 78 randomly selected controls among lunch attendees. The usual symptoms for scombroid fish poisoning were observed in cases, i.e. flushing (85.9%), headache (83.1%), rapid/weak pulse (59.1%) and diarrhoea (47.9%). Symptoms occurred from within a few minutes to up to 3 h following the meal. Most patients quickly recovered with antihistamine and/or symptomatic treatment. Tuna was the only food item positively associated with illness (odds ratio 36.3, 95% confidence interval 6.3-210.0), with the risk of illness increasing with the quantity of fish consumed. No bacterial contamination was found in leftover food, but histamine concentration in tuna was found to be 4900 mg/kg, almost 50-fold higher than the concentration allowed by European regulations. This report is unique because of the large size of the case series - to our knowledge, the largest event of scombroid fish poisoning ever reported - and the chemical and bacteriological analyses results obtained on leftover food.

16904446|t|Tolterodine extended release improves overactive bladder symptoms in men with overactive bladder and nocturia.
16904446|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nighttime dosing with tolterodine extended release (TER) in men with overactive bladder (OAB) and nocturia. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of data from two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nighttime (<4 hours before bedtime) TER (4 mg daily) dosing. Men with a mean micturition frequency of eight or more times in 24 hours, including a mean of 2.5 or more nocturia episodes/night, were included. For each micturition, patients used 7-day diaries to record urinary urgency on a 5-point urgency rating scale (1, none; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe; 5, urgency urinary incontinence). Micturitions were analyzed post hoc by urgency rating categories: total (1 to 5), non-OAB (1 to 2), OAB (3 to 5), and severe OAB (4 to 5). Adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 745 men (mean age 64 years) were randomized to placebo (n = 374) or TER (n = 371). Of the 745 men, 73% reported no incontinence episodes in a 7-day diary at baseline. At week 12, the weekly values for nighttime severe OAB micturitions and 24-hour and daytime total, OAB, and severe OAB micturitions were significantly reduced in the TER group versus the placebo group. The TER-treated men also reported a significant reduction in the mean urgency rating versus placebo. Adverse events associated with TER were low and comparable to those in the placebo group, with the exception of dry mouth (11% versus 4%). Withdrawals because of adverse events were infrequent (3% TER, 4% placebo). Five men were withdrawn for symptoms suggestive of urinary retention (3 TER, 2 placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Nighttime TER dosing reduced urgency-related micturitions and was well tolerated in men with OAB and nocturia.

21621190|t|Microbicidal efficacy of thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide after adding lactoperoxidase under saliva loading in the quantitative suspension test.
21621190|a|OBJECTIVE: As shown in the quantitative suspension test adding lactoperoxidase to a thiocyanate (SCN(-)) hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) combination over the physiological saliva level has significant positive antimicrobial effects to a level of totally killing Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Candida albicans. The aim of this study was to evaluate this positive effect under human saliva loading. METHODS: The bactericidal and fungicidal effect of lactoperoxidase was evaluated in a quantitative suspension test by using two test mixtures of a 2.0% thiocyanate and 1.2% hydrogen peroxide solution, one without (Group A) and one with (Group B) lactoperoxidase under saliva loading. Following the quantitative suspension tests (EN-13727/EN-13624), the growth of surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. The exposure times were restricted to 1, 3, 5, and 15 min. All statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: In the quantitative suspension test, the combination of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide showed relatively low antimicrobial effectiveness on S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and C. albicans in the presence of human saliva at measured time points in comparison to the mixture with lactoperoxidase, which showed a high bactericidal activity within 15 min (S. mutans and S. sanguinis) and fungicidal activity within 3 min (C. albicans). CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial effectiveness of the tested thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide combination was increased significantly by adding lactoperoxidase in the quantitative suspension test under human saliva loading.

17084260|t|Non-invasive assessment of endothelial function: which technique?
17084260|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare 3 non-invasive techniques for assessment of endothelial function in adults and children and evaluate their utility in acute inflammation. BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a key early event in pre-clinical atherosclerosis. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), although the established technique, is expensive and technically demanding. Measurements of vascular responses to inhaled salbutamol by pulse wave analysis (PWA) or pulse contour analysis (PCA) are potential alternatives. METHODS: Sixteen adults (mean age 28 years, range 18 to 39) and 16 children (mean age 13 years, range 7 to 17) underwent concurrent vascular function testing on 2 occasions with ultrasound, PWA, and PCA. Eighteen men were also studied before and after typhoid vaccination. RESULTS: Reproducibility of FMD was high in adults and children (coefficient of variation [CV] = 7.1 and 6.3, respectively). Salbutamol responses were more variable with PWA (adults CV = 11.5, children CV = 17.1) and PCA particularly in children (adults CV = 18.2, children CV = 36.3). Flow-mediated dilation (p < 0.001) and PWA with salbutamol (p = 0.03) responses fell after typhoid vaccination, and PCA (p = 0.7) was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular dysfunction during acute inflammation can be measured by FMD and by PWA with salbutamol. Flow-mediated dilation is less variable than PWA. Variability of PCA makes this technique currently unsuited to serial measures of endothelial function in children. Flow-mediated dilation remains the most reproducible method.

22806605|t|Association of high ventilator pressures with the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension in congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients requiring ECMO.
22806605|a|PURPOSE: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were examined to determine, if aspects of their complex ventilatory management were associated with the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension (cPH). METHODS: CDH patients requiring ECMO from 1992 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. cPH was defined as pulmonary hypertension at 3 months of age. Demographic and clinical variables including peak ventilatory pressures (PVP) and mean airway pressures (MAP) were tabulated. RESULTS: 10/31 (32 %) patients developed cPH. Gestational age, birth weight, inborn status, CDH side and liver position were not different between cPH and non-cPH patients. Pre-ECMO, both groups required statistically similar ventilatory support, though there was a trend toward higher oxygenation index and higher PVP for cPH patients. While ECMO duration was similar between groups, cPH patients required significantly higher PVP (30.0 vs. 25.0 cmH(2)O, p = 0.01) and MAP (11.5 vs. 9.0 cmH(2)O, p = 0.02) for ECMO decannulation. Post-ECMO, maximum PVP (50.0 vs. 26.0 cmH(2)O, p < 0.001), MAP (18.1 vs. 12.0, p = 0.001), HFV requirement (90 vs. 10 %, p < 0.001), and ventilator time (35.7 vs. 20 days, p < 0.001) increased significantly for cPH patients. CONCLUSION: Not until after ECMO decannulation do we see clinical differences separating patients who ultimately develop cPH. Although the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia may ultimately dictate ECMO decannulation criteria, perhaps greater physiologic optimization before decannulation could decrease the incidence of cPH.

22069692|t|The Discodermia calyx toxin calyculin a enhances cyclin D1 phosphorylation and degradation, and arrests cell cycle progression in human breast cancer cells.
22069692|a|Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle that is over expressed in more than half of breast cancer patients. The levels of cyclin D1 are controlled primarily through post-translational mechanisms and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at T286 induces its proteasomal degradation. To date, no studies have explored the involvement of phosphatases in this process. Here we treated human breast cancer cells with the structurally distinct toxins calyculin A, okadaic acid, and cantharidin, which are known to inhibit Ser/Thr phosphatases of the PPP family. At low nanomolar concentrations calyculin A induced T286 phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D1 via the proteosome in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Cyclin D1 degradation also was dose-dependently induced by okadaic acid and catharidin, implicating a negative regulatory role for type-2A phosphatases. These effects occurred without increasing phosphorylation of p70S6K, cyclin D3, or myosin light chain that were used as endogenous reporters of cellular PP2A and PP1 activity. A reverse phase phosphoprotein array analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of only 6 out of 33 Ser/Thr phosphosites, indicating selective inhibition of phosphatases by calyculin A. Calyculin A treatment induced cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that a specific pool of type-2A phosphatase is inhibited by calyculin A leading to the degradation of cyclin D1 in human breast cancer cells. The results highlight the utility of toxins as pharmacological probes and points to the T286 cyclin D1 phosphatase inhibited by calyculin A as a possible target for chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer.

15041316|t|The use of cyclosporine in renal transplantation.
15041316|a|The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) into clinical practice resulted in a dramatic reduction in the incidence and severity of acute rejection. As a result, short-term and medium-term kidney allograft survival increased greatly. However, the long-term patient and graft survival have not improved to a similar degree. This can partly be attributed to the side effects of CsA and partly to the fact that the use of CsA has not led to a reduced incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy. Thus, there has been a continuing search for strategies that minimize CsA toxicity but maintain adequate immunosuppression. This has resulted in the development of the CsA microemulsion formulation and improved methods for therapeutic drug monitoring. With the introduction of newer immunosuppressive drugs, early CsA withdrawal and CsA-free immunosuppressive therapy have become feasible. However, CsA weaning or complete avoidance is associated with a slightly higher risk of acute rejection, and the long-term efficacy and safety of such strategies remain to be established. Therefore, it is to be expected that in the near future CsA will remain part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen in many transplant centers.

9781609|t|Extended survival in 80 patients with operable, locoregionally recurrent breast cancer treated with chemotherapy.
9781609|a|Locoregional recurrence is a harbinger of disseminated disease, and historically the estimated 5-year survival when treated with local therapy only varies between 21% and 37%. The role of systemic treatment after local treatment is unclear at present. The authors investigated the results of systemic chemotherapy for these patients after complete local surgical resection. Data on 80 patients were evaluable for toxicity, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. Sixty-four patients received doxorubicin-based treatments, four received methotrexate-based combinations, and 12 received tamoxifen only. Among the 68 patients treated with cytostatics, there were two possible treatment-related deaths. Two patients developed grade 3 neutropenia, four developed grade 3 vomiting, and 42 had grade 2 toxicity. The 2- and 5-year disease free survival at a mean follow-up period of 5.5 years were 56% and 38%, respectively. The projected median TTF was 32 months (95% confidence interval, 23-82). Two- and 5-year overall survival were 86% and 62%, respectively, with a projected median survival of 93 months (7.75 years; 95% confidence interval, 64-177). These results show systemic therapy improved TTF and survival for patients with stage IV, no-evidence-of-disease breast cancer. Randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings and define optimal therapy.

11223159|t|Glatiramer acetate blocks interleukin-1-dependent nuclear factor-kappaB activation and RANTES expression in human U-251 MG astroglial cells.
11223159|a|RANTES is a basic 8-kDa polypeptide of the C-C chemokine subfamily with strong chemoattractant activity for T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages that are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Glatiramer acetate is a drug recently approved for the treatment of MS. We therefore investigated the effect of glatiramer acetate on RANTES expression in glial cells in vitro. Treatment of human U-251 MG astroglial cells with glatiramer acetate blocks IL-1beta-induced RANTES chemokine production in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Glatiramer acetate also decreased steady-state levels of RANTES mRNA in these cells, which was attributable to reduced transcription, as assessed by nuclear run-on assays. In addition, we showed that NF-kappaB may be the transcriptional activator responsible for the IL-1beta-mediated RANTES gene expression in this system. Our data indicated that the IL-1beta-induced increase in RANTES was associated with an increase in in vitro nuclear extract binding activity specific for the NF-kappaB site in the promoter region of the RANTES gene. The increases in RANTES mRNA and protein expression were suppressed by the NF-kappaB inhibitors gliotoxin, isohelenin, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increase in NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was prevented by pretreatment with glatiramer acetate or the NF-kappaB inhibitors. Our results suggest that glatiramer acetate may inhibit IL-1beta-stimulated RANTES expression in human glial cells by blocking NF-kappaB activation, thus identifying part of the molecular basis for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in demyelinating diseases.

12967804|t|Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin: an in vitro susceptibility comparison to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin using bacterial keratitis isolates.
12967804|a|PURPOSE: We compared the in vitro susceptibility patterns and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gatifloxacin (GAT) and moxifloxacin (MOX) (fourth-generation fluoroquinolones) to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ofloxacin (OFX) (second-generation fluoroquinolones) and levofloxacin (LEV; third-generation fluoroquinolone) using bacterial keratitis isolates. The goal was to determine whether the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones offer any advantages over the second- and third-generation fluoroquinolones. DESIGN: Experimental laboratory investigation. In contrast to an epidemiologic prevalence study, this study was designed to compare the relative susceptibility of each bacterial group to different fluoroquinolones by deliberate selection of representative isolates that were both susceptible and resistant to second-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: In retrospect, the MICs of 177 bacterial keratitis isolates were determined to CIP, OFX, LEV, GAT, and MOX using E tests. A relative susceptibility analysis was performed for each bacterial group that included separate bacterial groups that were resistant to second-generation fluoroquinolones. The NCCLS susceptibility patterns and the MICs were compared statistically. Comparing MICs, the antibiotic with the lower MICs has greater antibacterial activity. RESULTS: For most keratitis isolates, there were no susceptibility differences among the five fluoroquinolones. The fourth-generation fluoroquinolones did, however, demonstrate increased susceptibility for Staphylococcus aureus isolates that were resistant to CIP, LEV and OFX. In general, CIP demonstrated the lowest MICs for gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for fourth-generation fluoroquinolones were statistically lower than the second-generation fluoroquinolones for all gram-positive bacteria tested. Comparing the two fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, MOX demonstrated lower MICs for most gram-positive bacteria, whereas GAT demonstrated lower MICs for most gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Based on in vitro testing, the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones may offer some advantages over those currently available for the treatment of bacterial keratitis. Clinical studies will be required to confirm these results.

10342111|t|Determination of the antimicrobial activity of 29 clinically important compounds tested against fastidious HACEK group organisms.
10342111|a|HACEK group organisms are very fastidious organisms (Haemophilus spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominus, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella spp.) that can produce serious invasive infections such as endocarditis. Problems with susceptibility testing methods and their rarity of isolation limit available information of therapeutic choices, particularly among newer antimicrobial agents. Forty-two HACEK strains were tested by the Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) method against 29 antimicrobial agents. Nearly all compounds exhibited activity with best potency observed among the tested beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, "third- or fourth-generation" cephems, meropenem, fluoroquinolones, and rifampin. Numerous therapeutic options appear possible for initial parenteral treatment followed by oral "step-down" or switch therapy. Each case of HACEK infection therapy should be guided by accurate susceptibility tests, for which the Etest seems preferred for these fastidious species.

22494535|t|Mechanisms of drug resistance reversal in Dox-resistant MCF-7 cells by pH-responsive amphiphilic polyphosphazene containing diisopropylamino side groups.
22494535|a|pH-responsive drug carriers derived from polymers containing weak base groups have been shown to improve the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutics. The common interpretation is that a "proton sponge effect" caused by pH-responsive polymers facilitates endosomal membrane destruction and accelerates cytoplasmic drug release in tumor cells. However, the mechanisms by which pH-responsive weak base polymers disrupt membranes have not been expatiated clearly. Herein, we synthesized a series of pH-responsive amphiphilic polyphosphazenes containing diisopropylamino (DPA) side groups with various contents and investigated the effect of DPA content on the actions of polymers with cell membranes. In a certain pH range, the polymers with elevated DPA content showed enhanced membrane disruptive activity. Electrical interactions between the protonated DPA groups of polymers and the cell lipid bilayer are critical for pH-dependent membrane disruption, which can be competitively prevented by serum proteins. On the other hand, the hydrophobic unprotonated DPA moieties can insert into lipophilic regions of cell membrane. These synergic actions caused the alteration of biomembrane permeability consequently. More interestingly, it was also found that DPA-rich polymers exhibit higher P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition activity as compared with the polymer containing only low levels of DPA by efficiently blocking the internal epitope of P-gp. These findings strongly provide rational support for pH-responsive amphiphilic polyphosphazenes containing DPA side groups to be quite promising drug carriers for intracellular drug delivery applications, especially the treatment of P-gp overexpressing, drug-resistant tumors.

9160101|t|Inhibition of LPS and Plasmodium falciparum induced cytokine secretion by pentoxifylline and two analogues.
9160101|a|Pentoxifylline and the two analogues HWA138 and HWA448, at concentrations exceeding 60 micrograms/ml, inhibited malaria antigen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha secretion, but not IL-6 secretion, from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. HWA448 had lower inhibitory activity in vitro than pentoxifylline and HWA138. A small enhancement of cytokine secretion was induced by pentoxifylline and the two analogues at low concentrations. The drugs did not affect cell viability. Pentoxifylline, HWA138 and HWA448 also inhibited LPS induced TNF production in vivo in female CF1xBalb/c mice. The drugs were inhibitory at 0.5-1 mg per mouse when mixed with LPS, and 1 mg per mouse of the drugs was inhibitory when injected 1 h before LPS challenge. HWA448 had similar inhibitory activities in vivo compared to pentoxifylline and HWA138, possibly because of the longer serum half-life of HWA448. The pentoxifylline analogues may have lower toxicity than pentoxifylline itself and may therefore be useful in future treatment of diseases induced by endotoxic substances.

23326576|t|Monomer DJ-1 and its N-terminal sequence are necessary for mitochondrial localization of DJ-1 mutants.
23326576|a|DJ-1 is a novel oncogene and also a causative gene for familial Parkinson's disease (park7). DJ-1 has multiple functions that include transcriptional regulation, anti-oxidative reaction and chaperone and mitochondrial regulation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in DJ-1-knockout mice and fry, and mitochondrial DJ-1 is more protective against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Although translocation of DJ-1 into mitochondria is enhanced by oxidative stress that leads to oxidation of cysteine 106 (C106) of DJ-1, the characteristics of mitochondrial DJ-1 and the mechanism by which DJ-1 is translocated into mitochondria are poorly understood. In this study, immunostaining, co-immunoprecipitation, cell fractionation and pull-down experiments showed that mutants of glutamine 18 (E18) DJ-1 are localized in mitochondria and do not make homodimers. Likewise, DJ-1 with mutations of two cysteines located in the dimer interface, C46S and C53A, and pathogenic mutants, M26I and L166P DJ-1, were found to be localized in mitochondria and not to make homodimers. Mutant DJ-1 harboring both E18A and C106S, in which C106 is not oxidized, was also localized in mitochondria, indicating that oxidation of C106 is important but not essential for mitochondrial localization of DJ-1. It should be noted that E18A DJ-1 was translocated from mitochondria to the cytoplasm when mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced by treatment of cells with CCCP, an uncoupler of the oxidative phosphorylation system in mitochondria. Furthermore, deletion or substitution of the N-terminal 12 amino acids in DJ-1 resulted in re-localization of E18A, M26I and L166P DJ-1 from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that a monomer and the N-terminal 12 amino acids are necessary for mitochondrial localization of DJ-1 mutants and that conformation change induced by C106 oxidation or by E18 mutation leads to translocation of DJ-1 into mitochondria.

8856797|t|Effect of age, height, and prechallenge respiratory resistance on bronchial hyperresponsiveness in childhood asthma using the forced oscillation technique.
8856797|a|To evaluate the effects of age, height and prechallenge respiratory system resistance (Rrs) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine inhalation (BRm) as measured by the oscillation technique in children with mild asthma, we studied BRm in 92 atopic children aged from 8 to 13 years (mean +/- SD, 10.5 +/- 1.7 years). Inhalation challenge was performed by administering progressively doubling doses of methacholine, until a twofold increase in Rrs from baseline had been reached. The minimum cumulative dose of methacholine (Dmin) at which Rrs deviated from baseline was identified by the point of deflection of the continuously recorded Rrs tracing. The Dmin represented the amount of methacholine which elicited BRm. By using single-regression analysis, height was negatively correlated with Rrs (p < 0.001). Height was positively and Rrs was negatively correlated with age (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, height and age were correlated with Dmin (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), but prechallenge Rrs was not correlated with Dmin (p > 0.1). To minimize the effect of height and prechallenge Rrs on BRm, the relationships between Dmin and age was studied in a subgroup with a narrow range of heights (135-155 cm, n = 32), and a narrow range of prechallenge Rrs (5.0-6.9 cmH2 O/L/s, n = 42); there remained a statistically significant correlation between Dmin and age in the groups with comparable heights (p = 0.026) and Rrs (p = 0.003). These data suggest that the BHR in childhood asthma may be affected by height and age when measured by the oscillation technique. Considering the many advantages of the oscillation method, this technique may be very suitable for measuring BHR in childhood asthma.

12409828|t|Analysis of duodenal drainage fluid after cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation in healthy volunteers.
12409828|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Hormonal stimulatory agents are used to assess pancreatic function. Biologically derived secretin, the most widely used pancreatic secretagogue, is no longer available in the United States. Existing secretory tests using cholecystokinin alone are cumbersome, requiring a unique dual tube (gastric and duodenal) collection system and constant perfusion of a nonabsorbable marker to calculate enzyme output (in international units [IU]). A simpler, quantitative cholecystokinin stimulation test that measures enzyme concentrations (in international units per liter [IU/L]) instead of total output would obviate need for marker perfusion/collection. The aim of our experiment was to study the secretory patterns of pancreatic enzyme concentration in duodenal fluid after cholecystokinin stimulation in healthy volunteers. METHODOLOGY: Healthy subjects had a Dreiling tube inserted endoscopically into the ligament of Treitz. Gastric and duodenal aspiration ports were connected to low intermittent suction. A 20-minute baseline was obtained to clear the gastric and duodenal lumina of residual fluid. Cholecystokinin was infused at a constant rate of 40 ng/kg per hour. Duodenal fluid was collected on ice for 80 minutes in four 20-minute aliquots. Aspirated fluid was analyzed for enzyme concentration with an automated chemistry analyzer in the hospital biochemistry laboratory. RESULTS: Nineteen healthy volunteers were studied. The mean volume (+/-SEM) of duodenal fluid collected was 85 +/- 4.4 mL (range, 48 to 118 mL). Fluid analysis revealed a significant rise in mean lipase concentration (+/-SEM) from a baseline of 595,680 +/- 11,930 IU/L to a peak of 1,778,847 +/- 171,204 IU/L (mean difference = 1,183,167 IU/L; 95% CI= 664,459 IU/L to 1,701,875 IU/L; < 0.001, Student test). Increases in amylase concentrations were markedly less pronounced and did not reach statistical significance. Mean peak lipase concentration occurred within 50 minutes of acinar cell stimulation. All patients tolerated tube placement, and there were no episodes of acute pancreatitis or abdominal pain. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic lipase concentrations in duodenal fluid increase nearly threefold after cholecystokinin stimulation in healthy volunteers. This magnitude of enzyme secretory response may be a marker of pancreatic function and could potentially lead to a more clinically useful and simpler pancreatic function test. This physiologic study serves as the basis for our further investigations of cholecystokinin-stimulated lipase concentrations as a new test in the assessment of pancreatic insufficiency.

18517036|t|Slow wave sleep enhancement with gaboxadol reduces daytime sleepiness during sleep restriction.
18517036|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of enhanced slow wave sleep (SWS) on behavioral, psychological, and physiological changes resulting from sleep restriction. DESIGN: A double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled design was used to compare gaboxadol (GBX) 15 mg, a SWS-enhancing drug, to placebo during 4 nights of sleep restriction (5 h/night). Behavioral, psychological, and physiological measures of the impact of sleep restriction were assessed in both groups at baseline, during sleep restriction and following recovery sleep. SETTING: Sleep research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one healthy adults; 9 males and 12 females (mean age: 32.0 +/- 9.9 y) in the placebo group and 10 males and 10 females (mean age: 31.9 +/- 10.2 y) in the GBX group. INTERVENTIONS: Both experimental groups underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction. Each group received either GBX 15 mg or placebo on all sleep restriction nights, and both groups received placebo on baseline and recovery nights. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Polysomnography documented a SWS-enhancing effect of GBX with no group difference in total sleep time during sleep restriction. The placebo group displayed the predicted deficits due to sleep restriction on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and on introspective measures of sleepiness and fatigue. Compared to placebo, the GBX group showed significantly less physiological sleepiness on the MSLT and lower levels of introspective sleepiness and fatigue during sleep restriction. There were no differences between groups on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and a cognitive test battery, but these measures were minimally affected by sleep restriction in this study. The correlation between change from baseline in MSLT on Day 6 and change from baseline in SWS on Night 6 was significant in the GBX group and in both group combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced SWS, in this study produced by GBX, reduces physiological sleep tendency and introspective sleepiness and fatigue which typically result from sleep restriction.

17713456|t|Bacterial concepts in irritable bowel syndrome.
17713456|a|An overlap of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) exists across subtype groups. Symptoms include intestinal gas, diarrhea, dyspepsia, bloating, abdominal pain, and constipation. The unifying symptom may be excessive intestinal gas as a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation. Abnormal fermentation of food takes place when gut microbes expand proximally into the small intestine instead of being confined predominantly to the colon. Such proximal expansion of indigenous gut microbes or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may lead to activation of host mucosal immunity and an increase in intestinal permeability to result in flu-like extra-intestinal symptoms that accompany the classic IBS symptoms of altered bowels. The presence of methane on lactulose breath testing is associated with constipation-predominant IBS. Antibiotic therapy may be appropriate to treat underlying SIBO in IBS patients. Seventy-five percent improvement of IBS symptoms was reported in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study once antibiotics succeeded in treating bacterial overgrowth. Once a good clinical response and normalization of the lactulose breath test are achieved, a prokinetic agent may be used to stimulate phase III of interdigestive motility to delay relapse of bacterial overgrowth.

11795674|t|Preoperative oral application of immunoglobulin-enriched colostrum milk and mediator response during abdominal surgery.
11795674|a|Our objective was to evaluate the influence of pre-operative oral application of an immunoglobulin-enriched milk preparation on endotoxin translocation and mediator release during and after abdominal surgery. Forty patients who had been treated by partial (n = 4) or total gastrectomy (n = 8) or pancreatic resection (n = 28) were enrolled in a placebo-controlled pilot study. Pre-operatively, patients were randomly treated for 3 days by oral application of a bovine milk preparation (lactobin 56g/day, n = 20) or placebo (n = 20). In both groups, endotoxin translocation and mediator release was studied pre- and intraoperatively by measuring endotoxin, endotoxin-neutralizing capacity (ENC), interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, transferrin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, albumin, apoliprotein-A1/-B, IgG, IgA, and IgM. The clinical course was followed up by daily evaluation of the Apache-II-score. Clinical data were comparable in both groups. The lactobin group showed significantly lower levels of endotoxin and ENC compared to the placebo group. Acute phase response, endotoxin-binding proteins, and clinical outcome did not differ between both groups. We conclude that prophylactic oral application of lactobin reduces perioperative endotoxemia and prevents reduction of ENC, suggesting a stabilization of gut barrier during abdominal surgery.

17101331|t|Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility treated successfully with pyridostigmine.
17101331|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID) is a limited form of autoimmune autonomic neuropathy occurring idiopathically or in a paraneoplastic context. This disorder is considered rare, but is underrecognized as a cause for GI dysmotilities of varying anatomic extent, severity, and duration. We describe the diagnosis and management of an instructive case. METHODS: A 60-year-old (nondiabetic) woman presented with a 15-year history of severe isolated gastroparesis. Paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation aided the diagnosis of AGID. This included indirect immunofluorescence (neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies), radioimmunoprecipitation assays (neuronal and muscle plasma membrane cation channel antibodies), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (muscle striational antibodies). RESULTS: Serologic testing revealed both ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies. This profile was consistent with AGID and, despite the long history, raised the possibility of lung, breast, or ovarian carcinoma or thymoma. An underlying neoplasm was excluded by appropriate investigations. In a 1-month trial of oral pyridostigmine therapy, the patient's GI symptoms improved and her weight stabilized. Pyridostigmine was continued at a low dose, and was supplemented by tegaserod. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune serology is a valuable adjunct to the diagnosis and guide to management of patients with AGID. The favorable response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, despite a 15-year history, suggests an immunopharmacologic rather than an inflammatory cytotoxic pathology. Immunomodulatory therapy may not always be required. Of numerous autoantibodies currently recognized as biomarkers of AGID, the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor autoantibody is the only proven pathophysiologic effector. Certain neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic autoantibodies are highly predictive of an underlying malignancy.

15519795|t|Triple combination of irradiation, chemotherapy (pemetrexed), and VEGFR inhibition (SU5416) in human endothelial and tumor cells.
15519795|a|PURPOSE: This is the first preclinical report evaluating a trimodal therapy consisting of irradiation, chemotherapy, and antiangiogenesis in the context of a multimodal anticancer strategy. The combination of the folate antimetabolite pemetrexed, SU5416, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR2, and irradiation was investigated in human endothelial cells and tumor cell lines. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Primary isolated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), and human glioblastoma (U87) and prostate cancer cells (PC3) were exposed to pemetrexed (2 h) alone and in combination with SU5416 (2 h). When combined with irradiation up to 8 Gy, fixed concentrations of pemetrexed (1.06 muM) and SU5416 (1.0 muM) were used. Proliferation and clonogenic assays were conducted with endothelial and tumor cells. The migration/invasion ability of endothelial cells and the ability to produce tubular structures were tested in Matrigel and tube formation assays. Apoptosis was measured by sub-G1 DNA and caspase-3 flow cytometry. To investigate underlying cell signaling, immunocytochemistry was used to detect Akt survival signaling involvement. RESULTS: Triple combination using only a low-toxicity drug exposure of pemetrexed and SU5416 results in greater response than each treatment alone or than each combination of two modalities in all tested endothelial and tumor cell models. Triple combination substantially inhibits proliferation, migration/invasion, tube formation, and clonogenic survival. Triple combination also induced the highest rate of apoptosis in HDMEC and HUVEC as indicated by sub-1 G1 and caspase-3 assessment. Interestingly, triple combination therapy also reduces proliferation and clonogenic survival significantly in U87 and PC3 tumor cell lines. SU5416 potently inhibited Akt phosphorylation which could be induced by radiation and radiochemotherapy in human endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the high antiendothelial/antitumoral efficacy of the concurrent administration of irradiation, chemotherapy, and angiogenesis inhibition in vitro. A potential explanation for the favorable combination would be that VEGF signaling inhibition downregulates Akt survival signaling upon activation by radiation and/or chemotherapy. The data also suggest that endothelial cell apoptosis may have an important role in the benefits of the presented therapy.

16160002|t|Ruboxistaurin, a protein kinase C beta inhibitor, as an emerging treatment for diabetes microvascular complications.
16160002|a|OBJECTIVE: To review current clinical data regarding the pharmacologic actions of ruboxistaurin (LY333531) mesylate, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) beta, and its role to potentially reduce the development and/or the progression of diabetic microvascular complications. DATA SOURCES: Primary literature was obtained via a MEDLINE search (1966-August 2004) and through review of pertinent abstracts and presentations at major medical meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Literature relevant to PKC physiology, the pharmacokinetics of ruboxistaurin, and data evaluating the use of ruboxistaurin in treating diabetic microvascular complications in human and relevant animal models was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: PKC is part of a group of intracellular signaling molecules activated in response to various specific hormonal, neuronal, and growth factor stimuli. Hyperglycemia leads to PKC beta 1 and 2 isoform activation, which experimentally has been shown to contribute to the development and progression of diabetic microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) through various biochemical mechanisms. Animal and/or human studies using ruboxistaurin mesylate, a novel, highly selective inhibitor of PKC beta, have shown delay in the progression and, in some cases, reversal of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Ruboxistaurin mesylate, by inhibiting excessive activation of certain PKC isoforms, has the potential to reduce the burden of microvascular complications for patients with diabetes.

24716820|t|Use of an insulin bolus advisor facilitates earlier and more frequent changes in insulin therapy parameters in suboptimally controlled patients with diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injection therapy: results of the ABACUS trial.
24716820|a|BACKGROUND: We assessed the impact of using an automated bolus advisor integrated into a blood glucose meter on the timing and frequency of adjusting insulin therapy parameter settings and whether the availability of this technology would increase blood glucose test strip utilization in diabetes patients treated with multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study (ABACUS) trial, a 26-week, prospective, randomized, controlled, multinational study that enrolled 218 type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, demonstrated that use of an automated insulin bolus advisor helps improve glycemic control in suboptimally controlled, MDI-treated patients. Patient data were assessed to determine when and how often changes in insulin parameter settings occurred during the study. Patient meters were downloaded to determine blood glucose monitoring frequency. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three patients completed the study: 93 control arm (CNL) and 100 intervention (experimental) arm (EXP). Significantly more EXP (47.5%) than CNL (30.7%) patients received one or more changes in their insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) settings during the study (P=0.0191). Changes in ISF settings occurred earlier and more frequently in EXP than CNL patients throughout the study. A similar trend was seen in changes in insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. There were no differences in daily self-monitoring of blood glucose frequency [mean (SD)] between CNL and EXP patients: 4.7 (1.5) versus 4.6 (1.3) (P=0.4085). CONCLUSIONS: Use of an automated bolus advisor was associated with earlier, more frequent changes in key insulin parameters, which may have contributed to subsequent improvements in glycemic control but without increased glucose test strip utilization.

9544561|t|Croton ruizianus: platelet proaggregating activity of two new pregnane glycosides.
9544561|a|The MeOH extract of the aerial parts of Croton ruizianus afforded two new pregnane glycosides 1 and 2, together with the morphinandienone alkaloids flavinantine (3) and O-methylflavinantine (4). Their structures were elucidated by NMR experiments including 1H-1H (1D TOCSY and 2D DQF-COSY) and 1H-13C (HSQC, HMBC) spectroscopy. The proaggregating activity of the MeOH extract and the isolates were evaluated. Although the MeOH extract and pregnane glycosides (at different doses) were found to promote platelet aggregation, flavinantine (3) and O-methylflavinantine (4) showed only slight activity. The ability of the MeOH extract and the four compounds to act synergistically with thrombin was also evaluated. All the tested compounds were successful in augmenting the aggregating effect of thrombin, although to different degrees.

14739186|t|Using an electrocautery strategy or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone to induce ovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome: randomised controlled trial.
14739186|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of an electrocautery strategy with ovulation induction using recombinant follicle stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 168 patients with clomiphene citrate resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: 83 were allocated electrocautery and 85 were allocated recombinant follicle stimulating hormone. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic electrocautery of the ovaries followed by clomiphene citrate and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone if anovulation persisted, or induction of ovulation with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ongoing pregnancy within 12 months. RESULTS: . The cumulative rate of ongoing pregnancy after recombinant follicle stimulating hormone was 67%. With only electrocautery it was 34%, which increased to 49% after clomiphene citrate was given. Subsequent recombinant follicle stimulating hormone increased the rate to 67% at 12 months (rate ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.24). No complications occurred from electrocautery with or without clomiphene citrate. Patients allocated to electrocautery had a significantly lower risk of multiple pregnancy (0.11, 0.01 to 0.86). CONCLUSION: The ongoing pregnancy rate from ovulation induction with laparoscopic electrocautery followed by clomiphene citrate and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone if anovulation persisted, or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, seems equivalent to ovulation induction with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, but the former procedure carries a lower risk of multiple pregnancy.

12756207|t|In vitro metabolism of chloroquine: identification of CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 as the main isoforms catalyzing N-desethylchloroquine formation.
12756207|a|In humans, the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) is metabolized into one major metabolite, N-desethylchloroquine (DCQ). Using human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450), we performed studies to identify the P450 isoform(s) involved in the N-desethylation of CQ. In HLM incubated with CQ, only DCQ could be detected. Apparent Km and Vmax values (mean +/- S.D.) for metabolite formation were 444 +/- 121 microM and 617 +/- 128 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. In microsomes from a panel of 16 human livers phenotyped for 10 different P450 isoforms, DCQ formation was highly correlated with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (r = 0.80; p < 0.001), a CYP3A-mediated reaction, and CYP2C8-mediated paclitaxel alpha-hydroxylation (r = 0.82; p < 0.001). CQ N-desethylation was diminished when coincubated with quercetin (20-40% inhibition), ketoconazole, or troleandomycin (20-30% inhibition) and was strongly inhibited (80% inhibition) by a combination of ketoconazole and quercetin, which further corroborates the contribution of CYP2C8 and CYP3As. Of 10 cDNA-expressed human P450s examined, only CYP1A1, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C8 produced DCQ. CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 constituted low-affinity/high-capacity systems, whereas CYP2D6 was associated with higher affinity but a significantly lower capacity. This property may explain the ability of CQ to inhibit CYP2D6-mediated metabolism in vitro and in vivo. At therapeutically relevant concentrations ( approximately 100 microM CQ in the liver), CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and, to a much lesser extent, CYP2D6 are expected to account for most of the CQ N-desethylation.

9094880|t|The influence of different cereal grains on iron absorption from infant cereal foods.
9094880|a|Iron absorption from various cereal grains was evaluated in the present study to identify possible preferences for the preparation of infant weaning foods. In six separate studies, four radioiron absorption tests were performed in each of 57 volunteer subjects by using a sequential double-isotopic method. Serum ferritin concentration was used to adjust for the effect of differences in the iron status of subjects participating in separate studies. Identical commercial processing and test meal composition were used to evaluate iron absorption from 50 g cooked cereal prepared from rice, wheat, maize, oats, millet, and sweet or bitter quinoa. In an initial evaluation of cereals fortified with 2.5 mg Fe as FeSO4, geometric mean absorption values were uniformly < 1% for all cereals and were not significantly different. In subsequent studies, percentage iron absorption was enhanced by either eliminating the fortifying iron or adding 50 mg ascorbic acid to the test meal. The effect was similar for most of the cereals tested with a composite mean increase in absorption of 37% when fortifying iron was removed and 270% when ascorbic acid was added. There was a strong inverse correlation between iron absorption and the phytate content of different cereals. Except for a modestly lower absorption of iron from quinoa and a remarkably higher absorption from one lot of maize, we conclude that the type of cereal grain has little influence on iron bioavailability of infant cereals. On the other hand, modification in the milling and processing methods for cereal grains that reduce their content of phytic acid is likely to improve iron availability significantly.

20658295|t|Ultrasound-guided viscosupplementation of subacromial space in elderly patients with cuff tear arthropathy using a high weight hyaluronic acid: prospective open-label non-randomized trial.
20658295|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess if ultrasound (US)-guided viscosupplementation can reduce pain and improve function in elderly patients with cuff tear arthropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients aged over 65 with grade 3 or above cuff tear arthropathy were included in this prospective open-label non-randomized trial. Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Thirty-three patients received intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate under US guidance. Sixty patients constituted the control group. Shoulder joint function was assessed with Constant scores (CS) and pain with a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Compared with controls, treated patients reported a significant decrease in symptoms at 1 (mean CS 66 ±3.1 vs 37 ±6.9; mean VAS 1.9 ±1.2 vs 6.9 ±2.2), 2 (mean CS 65 ±3.2 vs 35 ±7.2; mean VAS 1.7 ±1.2 vs 6.8 ±2.5), 3 (mean CS 66 ±3.4 vs 33 6.1; mean VAS 2.3 ±1.2 vs 6.6 ±1.9), and 4 (mean CS 62 ±3.0 vs 34 ±6.5; mean VAS 3.3 ±1.4 vs 7.8 ±3.1) months, p<0.001. After 5 months there were no differences. CONCLUSION: US-guided viscosupplementation is a beneficial therapeutic option in the first months of treatment.

23769940|t|A novel approach to the management of a recurrent lymphocele following a femoral-femoral bypass.
23769940|a|An 86-year-old man presented with a recurrent groin lymphocele following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using an aorto-uni-iliac reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene femoral-femoral crossover. Following this procedure, the patient developed a groin lymphocele. This fluid collection was treated with multiple aspirations and subsequent groin exploration with lymphatic ligation. Despite ligation, the fluid collection returned. Given these recurrences, replacement of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft with Dacron was performed. After graft replacement, the lymphocele recurred. A lymphangiogram was then performed by directly injecting the lymphocele, identifying the culprit lymphatic channels allowing N-butyl cyanoacrylate injection to seal the source of lymphatic drainage. No reappearance of the lymphocele was observed.

16952487|t|Use of microdosing to predict pharmacokinetics at the therapeutic dose: experience with 5 drugs.
16952487|a|OBJECTIVES: A volunteer trial was performed to compare the pharmacokinetics of 5 drugs--warfarin, ZK253 (Schering), diazepam, midazolam, and erythromycin--when administered at a microdose or pharmacologic dose. Each compound was chosen to represent a situation in which prediction of pharmacokinetics from either animal or in vitro studies (or both) was or is likely to be problematic. METHODS: In a crossover design volunteers received (1) 1 of the 5 compounds as a microdose labeled with radioactive carbon (carbon 14) (100 microg), (2) the corresponding (14)C-labeled therapeutic dose on a separate occasion, and (3) simultaneous administration of an intravenous (14)C-labeled microdose and an oral therapeutic dose for ZK253, midazolam, and erythromycin. Analysis of (14)C-labeled drugs in plasma was done by use of HPLC followed by accelerator mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure plasma concentrations of ZK253, midazolam, and erythromycin at therapeutic concentrations, whereas HPLC-accelerator mass spectrometry was used to measure warfarin and diazepam concentrations. RESULTS: Good concordance between microdose and therapeutic dose pharmacokinetics was observed for diazepam (half-life [t((1/2))] of 45.1 hours, clearance [CL] of 1.38 L/h, and volume of distribution [V] of 90.1 L for 100 microg and t((1/2)) of 35.7 hours, CL of 1.3 L/h, and V of 123 L for 10 mg), midazolam (t((1/2)) of 4.87 hours, CL of 21.2 L/h, V of 145 L, and oral bioavailability [F] of 0.23 for 100 microg and t((1/2)) of 3.31 hours, CL of 20.4 L/h, V of 75 L, and F of 0.22 for 7.5 mg), and development compound ZK253 (F = <1% for both 100 microg and 50 mg). For warfarin, clearance was reasonably well predicted (0.17 L/h for 100 microg and 0.26 L/h for 5 mg), but the discrepancy observed in distribution (67 L for 100 microg and 17.9 L for 5 mg) was probably a result of high-affinity, low-capacity tissue binding. The oral microdose of erythromycin failed to provide detectable plasma levels as a result of possible acid lability in the stomach. Absolute bioavailability for the 3 compounds examined yielded excellent concordance with data from the literature or data generated in house. CONCLUSION: Overall, when used appropriately, microdosing offers the potential to aid in early drug candidate selection.

16939547|t|Pregabalin for peripheral neuropathic pain: results of a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study in Indian patients.
16939547|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of pregabalin in Indian patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. In this prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study, patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (n = 111) received pregabalin in doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. Primary efficacy measures included weekly pain score and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Despite a short study duration, a significant reduction was seen in weekly pain score (p < 0.0001), as well as VAS score of SF-MPQ (p < 0.0001). Significant improvements were also seen in other pain-related endpoints, weekly sleep interference score, quality of life measures, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement. Pregabalin was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence. The short study duration precluded the assessment of longer term safety issues such as weight gain. This study has demonstrated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of pregabalin for peripheral neuropathic pain in Indian patients.

19527402|t|Association of vaginal bleeding and electroconvulsive therapy use in pregnancy.
19527402|a|Electro-convulsive (ECT) therapy is frequently the treatment of choice in pregnant patients. It has been reported that administration of ECT in pregnancy is safe and effective. However, there are few controlled studies of the effects of ECT on pregnancy. The literature is not conclusive regarding ECT-related complications in pregnancy. We describe here the case of a primigravida with bipolar disorder who underwent nine sessions of ECT during pregnancy. The patient experienced vaginal bleeding after each session of ECT. Thiopental and succinylcholine were administered as an anesthetic (4 mg/kg thiopental) and muscle relaxant (1 mg/kg succinylcholine), respectively. ECT was discontinued and re-challenged after 20 days. The patient experienced bleeding after ECT again. Our case is somewhat unique because it demonstrates the potential maternal problem of vaginal bleeding as a result of ECT. In our case ECT led to vaginal bleeding and the bleeding stopped when ECT was ceased. Re-challenge was conducted. Although the safety of ECT administration in pregnancy has been discussed in many previous reports, its safety should be studied further.

21765046|t|Phase Ib trial of radiotherapy in combination with combretastatin-A4-phosphate in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
21765046|a|BACKGROUND: The vascular disrupting agent combretastatin-A4-phosphate (CA4P) demonstrated antitumour activity in preclinical studies when combined with radiation. METHODS: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prostate adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) received 27 Gy in 6 fractions treating twice weekly over 3 weeks, 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, and 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6 weeks respectively. CA4P was escalated from 50 mg/m2 to 63 mg/m2. CA4P exposure was further increased from one to three to six doses. Patients with SCCHN received cetuximab in addition. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients received 121 doses of CA4P. Dose-limiting toxic effects (DLTs) of reversible ataxia and oculomotor nerve palsy occurred in two patients with prostate cancer receiving weekly CA4P at 63 mg/m2. DLT of cardiac ischaemia occurred in two patients with SCCHN at a weekly dose of 50 mg/m2 in combination with cetuximab. Three patients developed grade 3 hypertension. Responses were seen in 7 of 18 patients with NSCLC. At 3 years, 3 of 18 patients with prostate cancer had prostate-specific antigen relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy with CA4P appears well tolerated in most patients. The combination of CA4P, cetuximab, and radiotherapy needs further scrutiny before it can be recommended for clinical studies.

12824742|t|Alcohol withdrawal changes cardiovascular responses to propranolol challenge.
12824742|a|The cardiovascular effects and plasma concentrations of a single dose of propranolol (80 mg) were studied non-invasively in alcohol-dependent subjects during alcohol withdrawal (AW) on day 1 and after resolution of withdrawal symptoms on day 10. At the onset of AW, propranolol caused a bradycardic effect which was significantly weakened on day 10. This might result from an increased bioavailability of propranolol on day 1 and from marked sympathetic activity. Propranolol also produced a negative inotropic effect, relatively weaker on day 1 than on day 10, being associated with increased beta-receptor sensitivity towards the final phase of AW. These results suggest that peripheral and central beta-adrenergic systems modulate the cardiovascular system in AW.

20651334|t|Alpha terpineol: a potential anticancer agent which acts through suppressing NF-kappaB signalling.
20651334|a|BACKGROUND: Alpha terpineol is a bioactive component of Salvia libanotica essential oil extract and has shown antitumour activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of alpha terpineol towards different tumour cell lines was evaluated in vitro. Mechanistic characterization was performed using analysis of drug activity in a cell line panel and drug-induced gene expression perturbation using the connectivity map approach. RESULTS: The small cell lung carcinoma was the cell line most sensitive to alpha terpineol. The results proposed alpha terpineol as an NF-kappaB inhibitor, which was confirmed by the observed dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappaB translocation and activity using two NF-kappaB assays, and by the down-regulation of the expression of several NF-kappaB-related genes such as IL-1 beta and IL1R1. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that alpha terpineol inhibits the growth of tumour cells through a mechanism that involves inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway.

12556733|t|A review of contemporary prevention strategies for radiocontrast nephropathy: a focus on fenoldopam and N-acetylcysteine.
12556733|a|The mechanism most likely responsible for the development of radiocontrast nephropathy (RCN) is contrast-induced renal tubular ischemia. At this time, intravenous hydration remains the mainstay for preventing RCN. The antihypertensive agent fenoldopam has been shown in a canine model, as well as in small, retrospective, prospective, and randomized human evaluations, to be effective for preventing RCN. In addition, studies have reported the ability of the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent RCN. The clinical trial data for NAC, however, are not consistent regarding this effect, which, if present, appears to be modest and perhaps restricted to lower-risk clinical scenarios.

18658080|t|Juvenile Huntington disease exacerbated by methylphenidate: case report.
18658080|a|The authors describe the case of an 8-year-old boy, otherwise healthy, who presented with symptoms consistent with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and was started on a trial of methylphenidate. Within 4 weeks, he experienced a rapid decline in fine motor skills, with dysarthria, intention tremor, motor impersistence, and diffusely increased tone. Symptoms persisted despite cessation of methylphenidate. At that time, a paternal history of Huntington disease was disclosed. Molecular analysis revealed an expansion in CAG repeats to 75 copies, within the range characteristic of juvenile Huntington disease. This report raises the possibility that use of dopaminergic agonists in patients with a family history of Huntington disease may lead to clinical exacerbation of motor symptoms and/or unwitting diagnosis in an unprepared family.

12463452|t|Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy for psoriatic arthritis.
12463452|a|As erosive and deforming arthritis is present in 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be as effective in controlling the progression of the disease as it is for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and cyclosporine (CsA) are the most widely used DMARDs in the treatment of PsA and are safe and effective in patients with active peripheral arthritis, although they do not appear to be effective on axial manifestations. No controlled study has evaluated the efficacy of these drugs on the progression of radiological damage. It has recently been demonstrated that leflunomide and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in PsA and psoriasis. The symptomatic improvement has been important and sustained and side effects minimal. In particular, inhibitors of TNF appear to have excellent potential to treat PsA. These agents are able to slow joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis and they are effective on spinal symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. Hopefully, these findings will prove true in PsA as well.

23543675|a|Adverse effects to antipsychotics are varied, frequently intolerable, often serious and sometimes fatal in clinical practice. Seizures are one of these adverse effects. Almost all first and second generation antipsychotics elicit dose-dependent lowering of seizure threshold, indicating increased seizure risk at higher drug dosages. The adverse event of zotepine induced seizure is published in few case reports. We report the occurrence of myoclonic seizure progressing to generalized tonic-clonic seizures with zotepine along with clear temporal association of dose dependent modulation evident in this case.

20400335|t|Post-operative heparin may not be required for transitioning patients with a HeartMate II left ventricular assist system to long-term warfarin therapy.
20400335|a|BACKGROUND: Anti-coagulation with heparin is often used after left ventricular assist device implantation as a transition to long-term warfarin therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of heparin use on thromboembolic and bleeding complications after implantation of the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD). METHODS: LVAD patients (n = 418) implanted as a bridge to transplant were divided into three groups: Group A patients (therapeutic, n = 118) received heparin and had a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of >50 seconds on two or more occasions; Group B patients (sub-therapeutic, n = 178) had at least one PTT value in the range of 40 to 55 seconds; and Group C patients (no heparin, n = 122) had no PTT values >40 seconds. All patients were transitioned to warfarin and aspirin therapy. The following adverse events were evaluated: ischemic stroke; hemorrhagic stroke; pump thrombosis; bleeding requiring surgery; and bleeding requiring > or = 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours. RESULTS: There was no difference in the percentages of patients with ischemic (5%, 4%, 3%) or hemorrhagic (3%, 3%, 5%) strokes or pump thrombosis (3%, 2%, 2%) after post-operative day (POD) 3 among Groups A, B and C, respectively. From PODs 3 to 30, the percentage of patients requiring transfusion for bleeding was significantly lower for Group C (18%) than for Groups A (32%) and B (26%) (p = 0.04); differences after 30 days were not significant. Multivariate analysis revealed that post-operative heparin use, low post-operative platelet count and low baseline hematocrit value were independent risk factors for bleeding events between PODs 3 and 30. CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving the HeartMate II LVAD who were directly transitioned to warfarin and aspirin therapy without intravenous heparin there was no short-term increase in risk of thrombotic or thromboembolic events, and bleeding requiring transfusion was significantly reduced. Additional long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate possible late effects.

8137986|a|Our results confirm the previous report that rapid suppression by GnRH-a is favorable relative to delayed suppression (1). They further indicate that the pattern of E2 production during GnRH-a-induced ovarian suppression may be predictive of cycle outcome. We suggest that imperfect pituitary suppression of bioactive LH as indicated by an aberrant rise in E2 during GnRH-a down-regulation may compromise oocyte quality and ultimately impair implantation. Further study of follicular phase E2 response to GnRH-a suppression may provide a prognostic marker for implantation.

8990381|t|Differential sensitivity of resting and IL-2 activated NK cells to R-verapamil.
8990381|a|Natural killer (NK) cells are the first lymphoid population to reconstitute the peripheral blood compartment of immunologically compromised bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. Recent data suggest that, among patients transplanted for leukemia, NK cells can prevent or delay disease relapse by mediating a cytotoxic graft vs leukemia (GvL) response. Although the major mechanism by which NK cells mediate target cell lysis involves degranulation and release of cytolytic effector molecules (granzymes, proteoglycans, perforin), accumulating evidence suggests that NK cells possess additional pathways to mediate target cell killing. In fact, it is well recognized that recombinant cytokines such as IL-2 enhance the in vitro cytolytic activity of NK cells. In this study, we observed that the lytic activity mediated by resting and IL-2 activated NK cells against the same target cell appears to occur via two distinct pathways, as distinguished by their differential response to R-verapamil. Specifically, we observed that 25 microM R-verapamil inhibited the lytic activity of resting NK cells against K562 targets by approximately 50%. However, the lytic activity of IL-2 activated NK cells was unaffected by this concentration of R-verapamil. Additional studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of R-verapamil on NK cytotoxic activity was associated with its ability to prevent degranulation of cytotoxic granules. Specifically, R-verapamil inhibited BLT esterase release from resting but not IL-2 activated NK cells. These data suggest that IL-2 activated NK cells can promote target cell lysis by a pathway (possibly degranulation independent) distinct from that used by resting NK cells. We speculate that the target of R-verapamil on resting NK cells is P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an ABC transporter that we recently reported was expressed on NK cells and whose functional activity is known to be inhibited by R-verapamil.

21153846|t|Awareness during anesthesia: the results of a questionnaire survey in Japan.
21153846|a|PURPOSE: We planned a survey to evaluate the current incidence and risk factors of intraoperative awareness. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted via the Internet. The survey was designed to obtain information regarding cases involving intraoperative awareness in 2008. RESULTS: A total of 172 anesthesiologists answered the survey. The total number of reported anesthetic cases was 85,156. Twenty-four cases of definite or possible awareness were reported by 21 anesthesiologists, of which 14 were cases of definite awareness and ten of possible awareness. The incidence of awareness, including possible awareness, was 0.028%. Propofol was used in 21 cases, sevoflurane in two, and a high dose of fentanyl in one. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was used in seven cases (29%). Sixteen patients (67%) were <50  years old, six (26%) were men, and 17 (74%) were women. As the type of surgery, three cases (13%) involved gynecological surgeries and seven (30%) involved cervicofacial surgeries. During surgery, the memory at postural change was preserved in two cases. CONCLUSION: The most surprising finding of this study is that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was used in 21 of the 24 (88%) cases of definite and possible awareness. Although the incidence of intraoperative awareness was compatible with the previous studies, meticulous care should be taken when anesthesia is performed by TIVA for high-risk patients. The results of this survey should be verified, as well as further continuous survey and prospective study, because this study was performed by an anonymous questionnaire survey conducted over only 1-year period.

25454931|t|Emergency department ondansetron use in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and vomiting.
25454931|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the hypothesis that ondansetron administration to children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) presenting for emergency department (ED) care with intercurrent illness and vomiting improves clinical outcomes by reducing hospitalization rates (primary), length of ED stay, intravenous fluid (IVF) administration, and revisits (secondary outcomes). STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single-center, 10-year retrospective cohort study of 345 ED encounters of children aged 6 months-8 years with T1DM and vomiting. We compared outcomes among children receiving and not receiving ondansetron. To avoid selection bias related to ondansetron administration, we also investigated outcomes by conducting comparisons by ondansetron usage periods (ie, low [2002-2004] vs high [2009-2011]). RESULTS: Ondansetron usage increased from 0% to 67% of ED encounters between 2002 and 2011. Admission rates were similar among those administered [54% (58/107)] and not administered ondansetron [55% (131/238)]. Length of stay was longer in children receiving ondansetron (409 vs 315 minutes; P = .03). IVF administration (77% vs 77%) and revisits (5.6% vs 5.9%) were similar. Ondansetron administration was not associated with reduced admission in logistic regression modeling. Admission rate (62%; 56/91 vs 49%; 57/111) (-13%, 95% CI -23%, 3%), length of stay (395 vs 327 minutes [IQR 164 501]; P < .001), and IVF administration decreased (84% [77/91] to 70% [78/111]; P = .02] when comparing low and high ondansetron usage periods. CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron administration was not independently associated with lower admission rates. Over time, along with increasing ondansetron use, there have been reductions in admissions, length of stay, and IVF administration in children with T1DM.

8383102|t|In-vitro activity of azithromycin on Chlamydia trachomatis infected, polarized human endometrial epithelial cells.
8383102|a|The in-vitro activity of azithromycin on Chlamydia trachomatis infected human endometrial epithelial cells, both primary and transformed cells growing in a polarized and non-polarized orientation, was analyzed. Addition of azithromycin two hours after adsorption inoculation with continued exposure until 72 h gave an MIC90 and MBC90 of 0.063 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the MBC results were more pronounced in infected cells growing in a polarized orientation. Numerous small fluorescent 'spots' (presumed small abnormal inclusions) were visible in the infected cells exposed to MIC concentrations of azithromycin. Immuno-transmission electron microscopy examination revealed intracellular inclusions filled with chlamydial envelope ghosts. Since standard diagnostic antigen detection methods use anti-envelope antibodies, the aberrant envelope-filled inclusions might be interpreted as viable inclusions by fluorescent microscopy and result in high false positive readings. To simulate treatment of an infected patient, azithromycin was added at 18 h to infected cells containing many reticulate bodies and exposure continued for 54 h after which killing of chlamydiae was seen. The use of polarized human cells may offer a more relevant in-vitro model system for examining the efficacy of antimicrobial action.

12814958|t|Selectivities of human cytochrome P450 inhibitors toward rat P450 isoforms: study with cDNA-expressed systems of the rat.
12814958|a|The aim of this study was to determine the selectivities of chemical inhibitors for human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms toward the corresponding rat P450 isoforms by using cDNA-expressed rat P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A1, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, and CYP3A2). Among the inhibitor probes for human P450s used in this study, only sulfaphenazole showed a selective inhibitory effect on the activity of the corresponding rat P450 isoform (CYP2C6). Furafylline also preferentially inhibited the activity of rat CYP1A2. However, methoxalen and ketoconazole more strongly inhibited the activities of other P450 isoforms than those of the corresponding rat P450 isoforms, CYP2A1 and CYP3A1/2, respectively. On the other hand, quinidine and aniline had little effect on the activities of the corresponding rat P450 isoforms, CYP2D2, and rat CYP2E1, respectively. These results suggest that chemical probes that have been used for human P450 isoforms do not always exhibit the same selectivity for the corresponding rat P450 isoforms. However, it appears that sulfaphenazole can be used as a selective inhibitor for rat CYP2C6. In addition, furafylline may also be a relatively selective inhibitor for rat CYP1A2.

8355469|t|Fish oil in lupus nephritis: clinical findings and methodological implications.
8355469|a|Our objective was to determine the effects of fish oil on renal function, symptoms, and serum lipids in patients with lupus nephritis. A double-blind, randomized crossover trial of fish oil versus placebo (olive oil) was done on 26 patients with confirmed systemic lupus; 21 completed the study. Intervention was fish oil or placebo, 15 g/day, for one year followed by a 10 week wash-out period, and then the reverse treatment for one year. At baseline and six month intervals, we measured platelet membrane fatty acids, indices of renal function, a disease activity index, serum lipid levels, blood pressure, serum viscosity and red cell flexibility. We found that platelet membrane phospholipids were uniformly affected by fish oil supplementation (P < 0.001) but with significant carry-over effects despite a 10 week wash-out period. Glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine were not affected. A non-significant reduction in mean (SE) 24-hour proteinuria occurred, from 1424.1 mg (442.7) on placebo to 896.7 mg (352.2) on fish oil (P = 0.21). Fish oil lowered serum triglycerides from 1.89 (0.25) mmol/liter to 1.02 (0.11) mmol/liter (P = 0.004). VLDL cholesterol decreased markedly whether patients initially received fish oil or placebo (P = 0.004). The size of the reduction was affected by the order of treatment (P = 0.03), but parallel comparisons were significant before the crossover (P = 0.0006). With the possible exception of bleeding time, no other treatment effects were shown with fish oil. However, treatment order effects were seen in urinary IgG excretion (P = 0.03), whole blood viscosity (P < 0.0001), red cell flexibility (P = 0.004), and bleeding time (P = 0.06). In conclusion, one year of dietary supplementation with fish oil in patients with stable lupus nephritis did not improve renal function or reduce disease activity, but did alter some lipid parameters. Hitherto unreported carry-over effects and treatment order effects caused by the olive oil created a risk of type II error, and bear methodologic consideration in the design of future studies.

21893937|t|From targets to treatments: a review of molecular targets in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
21893937|a|Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NET) are relatively rare, slowly growing tumors, although their incidence is increasing, and patients may survive for several years with metastatic disease. Apart from symptomatic relief, there have been few treatment options for these tumors in the past. More recently, investigators have explored the potential of molecularly targeted agents in treating pancreatic NET, with some success. In this review, we consider the data supporting exploitation of different targets in pancreatic NET, including peptide receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases (involved in tumor angiogenesis and more directly supporting tumor growth), and intracellular targets, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has a central role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and apoptosis. Probably due to the paucity of pancreatic NET, many clinical trials to date have included heterogeneous NET populations, and there are few randomized studies of this specific patient population. Very recently, promising results have been achieved in placebo-controlled, phase III trials with the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, and the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus. These agents have been approved or are currently being reviewed by authorities for use in patients with pancreatic NET. Here we review potential molecular targets in pancreatic NET and summarize the available data for targeted agents from phase II and III trials open to patients with this tumor.

21547572|t|Tesetaxel, a new oral taxane, in combination with capecitabine: a phase I, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors.
21547572|a|PURPOSE: This phase I study was conducted primarily to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tesetaxel, a novel, orally active, semisynthetic microtubule inhibitor of the taxane class, administered with oral capecitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: During each 21-day cycle, patients were to receive tesetaxel on Day 1 and capecitabine twice daily on Days 1 through 14. The starting dose was tesetaxel 18 mg/m(2) and capecitabine 1,250 mg/m(2)/day. These doses were increased based on tolerability during the first cycle according to the protocol-specified dose-escalation scheme. Response was evaluated every other treatment cycle according to RECIST. Serial blood samples were collected during the first and second cycles to explore possible pharmacokinetic drug interactions. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled and treated. The most frequently reported dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, with individual patients experiencing dose-limiting stomatitis and diarrhea. The MTD for the treatment regimen was defined as tesetaxel 27 mg/m(2) and capecitabine 2,500 mg/m(2)/day. The most common >=  Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events included leukopenia (44% of patients) and neutropenia (41%). Of 22 evaluable patients, the best overall response was stable disease in 82% and progressive disease in 18%. No meaningful pharmacokinetic drug interactions were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that these two orally active agents can be combined at the individual MTD of each drug with acceptable toxicity. These data further support the continued clinical development of tesetaxel both as a single agent and in combination with other active cancer therapeutics.

17990061|t|The effect of nicotine on perceptual, ocular motor, postural, and vegetative functions at rest and in motion.
17990061|a|Nicotine has wellknown, unpleasant side effects, e.g., transient dizziness, nausea, and nicotine-induced nystagmus (NIN). To investigate factors influencing these effects, we addressed three questions: (1) Is the intensity of dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness dependent on nicotine dosage? (2) Does the intensity of perceptual, ocular motor, vegetative effects, and postural imbalance correlate? (3) Do visual or vestibular motion stimuli produce and/or aggravate distressing dizziness and nausea? Sixty healthy non-smokers or occasional smokers participated; 40 were tested once before and six times after application of a nicotine nasal spray in doses of 1 mg or 2 mg with or without motion stimulation; 20 received a placebo nasal spray. Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly related to nicotine dosage. Dizziness, nausea, NIN, and unsteadiness also depended on the nicotine dosage (p < 0.01).Nicotine blood concentration was a better predictor for the temporal dependence of nystagmus than nicotine dosage. Dizziness correlated highly with nausea (R = 0.63, p < 0.001). The degree of nicotine-induced nausea significantly correlated with postural imbalance. The time course of postural sway differed according to nicotine dosage and gender: for women, there was no clear relationship between sway magnitude and nicotine dosage, while men showed increased sway with higher dosage. Motion stimulation increased nicotine-induced dizziness and nausea, but did not significantly influence NIN or postural imbalance. Our data support the view that all measured adverse effects reflect dose-dependent nicotine-induced vestibular dysfunction. Additional motion stimulation aggravates dizziness and nausea, i.e., nicotine increases sensitivity to motion sickness.

8942537|t|Claude H. Organ, Jr. Honorary Lectureship. Glutamine, cancer, and its therapy.
8942537|a|OBJECTIVE: This overview on glutamine, cancer and its therapy discusses some of the in vitro and in vivo work on glutamine and tumor growth, and summarizes animal and human data on the potential benefits of glutamine in the tumor-bearing host receiving radiation or chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. A tumor can act as a "glutamine trap," depleting host glutamine stores and resulting in cachexia. In vitro evidence of the dependence of tumor growth on glutamine has deterred its use in the clinic setting. METHODS: Data from a variety of investigations studying glutamine's interaction with the tumor-bearing host receiving radiation or chemotherapy were compiled and summarized. RESULTS: A large body of evidence in vivo suggests that supplemental glutamine does not make tumors grow but in fact results in decreased growth through stimulation of the immune system. When given with radiation or chemotherapy, glutamine protects the host and actually increases the selectivity of therapy for the tumor. CONCLUSION: Further prospective randomized trials are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans undergoing radiation and chemotherapy.

20230404|t|Favourable outcome of patients with childhood acute promyelocytic leukaemia after treatment with reduced cumulative anthracycline doses.
20230404|a|Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) treatment often includes high cumulative doses of anthracyclines, which can cause long-term cardiotoxicity. Here, we report the favourable outcome in 81 paediatric APL patients treated according to the consecutive acute myeloid leukaemia-Berlin/Frankfurt/Muenster (AML-BFM) trials -93/-98/-2004 with an anthracycline-cytarabine regimen in combination with all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA). Outcomes achieved by treatment with a reduced cumulative anthracycline dose (350 mg/m(2)) were comparable to those reported for studies with higher doses. Five-year overall survival of the total cohort was 89 +/- 4% and event-free survival (pEFS) was 73 +/- 6%. Overall survival was similar when comparing AML-BFM trial periods (trial 93: 88 +/- 8%, 98: 85 +/- 7% and 2004: 94 +/- 8%, P((logrank)) = 0.63). Seventy-five (93%) patients achieved complete remission. Most fatal events occurred during the first 6 weeks of treatment. Long-term cardiotoxicity was observed in one patient. Two patients suffered from secondary haematological malignancies. Salvage treatment was effective in 7/9 patients (78%) with relapsed APL, who now are long-term survivors after second line combination treatment with arsenic trioxide (4/7 patients) and stem cell transplantation (5/7 patients). Our results demonstrate that - combined with ATRA - a lower cumulative anthracycline dose can be used safely to maintain high cure rates and promote the reduction of long-term sequelae, such as cardiotoxicity in APL patients.

16477616|t|S100B protects LAN-5 neuroblastoma cells against Abeta amyloid-induced neurotoxicity via RAGE engagement at low doses but increases Abeta amyloid neurotoxicity at high doses.
16477616|a|At the concentrations normally found in the brain extracellular space the glial-derived protein, S100B, protects neurons against neurotoxic agents by interacting with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). It is known that at relatively high concentrations S100B is neurotoxic causing neuronal death via excessive stimulation of RAGE. S100B is detected within senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, where its role is unknown. The present study was undertaken to evaluate a putative neuroprotective role of S100B against Abeta amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. We treated LAN-5 neuroblastoma cultures with toxic amounts of Abeta25-35 amyloid peptide. Our results show that at nanomolar concentrations S100B protects cells against Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity, as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein isothiocyanate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) experiments, by countering the Abeta-mediated decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. This effect depends on S100B binding to RAGE because S100B is unable to contrast Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity in neurons overexpressing a signaling-deficient RAGE mutant lacking the cytosolic and transducing domain. Our data suggest that at nanomolar doses S100B counteracts Abeta peptide neurotoxicity in a RAGE-mediated manner. However, at micromolar doses S100B is toxic to LAN-5 cells and its toxicity adds to that of the Abeta peptide, suggesting that additional molecular mechanisms may be involved in the neurotoxic process.

1542489|t|Antitumor activity of the pineal gland: effect of unidentified substances versus the effect of melatonin.
1542489|a|There is growing evidence that the pineal gland has antineoplastic properties which, however, can only partially be attributed to its hormone melatonin. While the in vivo tumor-inhibiting activity of melatonin is established, observations on its in vitro effects have been contradictory. The effect of this substance was investigated on six human cancer cell lines and compared to the activity of a partially purified, melatonin-free low molecular weight pineal extract (UMO5R). Melatonin showed hardly any effect but UMO5R was capable of inhibiting the growth of all the six cell lines tested. It is therefore concluded that a direct inhibiting action on tumor cells is not a general physiological role of melatonin as opposed to UMO5R. It will be worthwhile to purify the yet unidentified pineal antitumor activity since it may have a considerable therapeutic potential.

8739847|a|In previous investigations we found an increase of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum of patients with nocturnal myoclonus syndrome (NMS) after treatment with dopamimetics. Under the hypothesis, that, according to animal experiments, the glutamatergic system could be involved in this atypical dopaminergic up-regulation in NMS. The glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine was tested in up to now two NMS patients. The results and the success of this approach and its implications are discussed.

10625937|t|Mammary tumor inhibition by IP6: a review.
10625937|a|While most studies of diet and breast cancer are focused on the role of fat, very few have addressed the effect of fiber. Emerging epidemiological data, and careful review of previous studies point to a negative correlation of breast cancer with high fiber cereal diets. Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is abundant in cereals and legumes, particularly in the bran part of mature seeds. Experimental studies using 7,12-dimethylbenz [alpha]anthracene (DMBA) and N-methylnitrosourea (NMU) in rats and mice in vivo, as well as human cell lines in vitro demonstrate a reproducible and striking anti-cancer action of IP6. It therefore appears that IP6 is one of the components, if not the most active ingredient, of high fiber cereal diet responsible for cancer inhibition. Could eating high fiber diet afford the same protection as IP6? Thus, we investigated whether dietary fiber containing high IP6 shows a dose-response inhibition of DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis, and if pure IP6 is more active as a cancer preventive agent, compared to that in diet. Our data show that supplemental dietary fiber in the form of bran exhibited a modest, statistically nonsignificant inhibitory effect. In contrast, animals given IP6 in drink showed significant reduction in tumor number, incidence and multiplicity. Therefore, pure IP6 is definitively more effective than a high fiber diet in preventing experimental mammary tumors. Thus, for cancer prevention, prophylactic intake of IP6 may be not only more effective, but also more practical than gorging on large quantities of fiber.

9612397|t|Apolipoprotein AIV: a potent endogenous inhibitor of lipid oxidation.
9612397|a|Overexpression of apolipoprotein (apo) AIV in transgenic mice confers significant protection against atherosclerosis in apoE knockout animals even in the presence of a more severe atherogenic lipid profile. Because lipoprotein oxidation has been recognized to be pivotal in development of atherosclerosis, the antioxidative activity of apoAIV was investigated. Fasting intestinal lymph was used to mimic conditions in the interstitial fluid, the potential site for lipoprotein oxidation in vivo. ApoAIV (10 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited copper-mediated oxidation of lymph. This inhibitory effect was further evaluated using purified low-density lipoprotein. Addition of apoAIV (2.5 micrograms/ml) increased the time of 50% conjugated diene formation by 2.4-fold, whereas apoE or BSA did not show such a protection even at 20 micrograms/ml. Addition of apoAIV during the propagation phase also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition. ApoAIV also protected macrophage-induced oxidation of fasting lymph. These results provide the first evidence that apoAIV is a potent endogenous antioxidant.

17020434|t|Optimising stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
17020434|a|Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high-risk patients.

24466091|t|Canonical WNT signaling inhibits follicle stimulating hormone mediated steroidogenesis in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells.
24466091|a|Beta-catenin (CTNNB1), a key component of wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family (WNT) signaling, participates in follicle stimulated hormone-mediated regulation of estrogen (E2) production. The purpose of these studies was to determine if CTNNB1's contribution to FSH-mediated steroidogenesis in primary rat granulosa cells was due in part to extracellular stimulation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway. To achieve this purpose, primary cultures of rat granulosa cells were exposed to vehicle or a canonical member of the WNT signaling pathway, WNT3A, before co-culture and in the presence or absence of FSH for 24 h. Activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway was determined by dose-dependent induction of Axin2 mRNA expression and stimulation of the CTNNB1/T cell factor promoter-reporter TOPflash. WNT pathway induction was demonstrated at doses of 50 and 500 ng/mL of WNT3A. Granulosa cells treated with WNT3A in combination with FSH had enhanced CTNNB1/T cell factor transcriptional activity above cells treated with WNT3A alone. Steroidogenic enzymes and ovarian differentiation factor mRNAs were quantified via quantitative PCR. Expression of steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs aromatase (Cyp19a1), P450 side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star) were increased following FSH treatment. Co-incubation of WNT3A and FSH reduced the ability of FSH to stimulate steroidogenic enzymes and subsequent E2 and progesterone (P4) production. Concomitant activation of FSH and WNT pathways results in marked reduction of ovarian differentiation factors, LH receptor (Lhcgr) and inhibin-alpha (Inha). Therefore, WNT inhibits FSH target genes and steroid production associated with maturation and differentiation of the ovarian follicle.

17927485|t|Paliperidone: a new extended-release oral atypical antipsychotic.
17927485|a|Paliperidone extended release (ER) is the most recent atypical antipsychotic to become available for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has a unique extended-release delivery system, allowing once/day dosing with steady plasma concentrations of the medication. Several randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials have shown paliperidone ER to be efficacious in the management of acute schizophrenia as well as for the prevention of symptom recurrence when compared with placebo. Patients in the treatment groups receiving daily doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg displayed generalized symptom improvement using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and improved functioning on the Personal and Social Performance Scale. Paliperidone ER has been shown to be generally safe and tolerable. At its recommended dose of 6 mg daily, the reported extrapyramidal symptom adverse events are similar to placebo, and weight gain is very modest. However, at higher doses, weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms are more elevated. Paliperidone ER has the potential to offer advantages over its parent compound and other second generation agents, and may aid in ensuring compliance among persons with schizophrenia. At present, there are no published data from a comparative trial with paliperidone ER versus its parent compound or other second-generation antipsychotic agents.

20384650|t|A short-term, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dronedarone versus amiodarone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: the DIONYSOS study.
20384650|a|INTRODUCTION: We compared the efficacy and safety of amiodarone and dronedarone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Five hundred and four amiodarone-naÃ¯ve patients were randomized to receive dronedarone 400 mg bid (n = 249) or amiodarone 600 mg qd for 28 days then 200 mg qd (n = 255) for at least 6 months. Primary composite endpoint was recurrence of AF (including unsuccessful electrical cardioversion, no spontaneous conversion and no electrical cardioversion) or premature study discontinuation. Main safety endpoint (MSE) was occurrence of thyroid-, hepatic-, pulmonary-, neurologic-, skin-, eye-, or gastrointestinal-specific events, or premature study drug discontinuation following an adverse event. RESULTS: Median treatment duration was 7 months. The primary composite endpoint was 75.1 and 58.8% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively, at 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.98; P < 0.0001), mainly driven by AF recurrence with dronedarone compared with amiodarone (63.5 vs 42.0%). AF recurrence after successful cardioversion was 36.5 and 24.3% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively. Premature drug discontinuation tended to be less frequent with dronedarone (10.4 vs 13.3%). MSE was 39.3 and 44.5% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively, at 12 months (HR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.60-1.07; P = 0.129), and mainly driven by fewer thyroid, neurologic, skin, and ocular events in the dronedarone group. CONCLUSION: In this short-term study, dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone in decreasing AF recurrence, but had a better safety profile, specifically with regard to thyroid and neurologic events and a lack of interaction with oral anticoagulants.

11799158|t|Virion disassembly is required for apoptosis induced by reovirus.
11799158|a|Reovirus infection leads to apoptosis in cultured cells and in vivo. Binding of viral attachment protein final sigma 1 to both sialic acid and junction adhesion molecule is required for induction of apoptosis. However, it is not known whether viral engagement of receptors is sufficient to elicit this cellular response. To determine whether steps in reovirus replication subsequent to viral attachment are required for reovirus-induced apoptosis, we used inhibitors of viral disassembly and RNA synthesis, viral disassembly intermediates, temperature-sensitive (ts) reovirus mutants, and reovirus particles deficient in genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We found that reovirus-induced apoptosis is abolished in the presence of the viral disassembly inhibitors ammonium chloride and E64. Infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which are intermediates in reovirus disassembly that can be generated in vitro by protease treatment, are capable of inducing apoptosis in the presence or absence of these inhibitors. Treatment of cells with the viral RNA synthesis inhibitor ribavirin does not diminish the capacity of reovirus to induce apoptosis, and reovirus ts mutants arrested at defined steps in viral replication produce apoptosis with efficiency similar to that of wild-type virus. Furthermore, reovirus particles lacking dsRNA are capable of inducing apoptosis. Finally, we found that viral attachment and disassembly must occur within the same cellular compartment for reovirus to elicit an apoptotic response. These results demonstrate that disassembly of reovirus virions to form ISVPs, but not viral transcription or subsequent steps in viral replication, is required for reovirus to induce apoptosis.

19950162|t|Novel imatinib derivatives with altered specificity between Bcr-Abl and FMS, KIT, and PDGF receptors.
19950162|a|Imatinib is a clinically important ATP analogue inhibitor that targets the tyrosine kinase domain of the intracellular Abl kinase and the PDGF receptor family. Imatinib has revolutionised the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is caused by the oncogene Bcr-Abl and certain solid tumours that harbor oncogenic mutations of the PDGF receptor family. As a leading kinase inhibitor, imatinib also provides an excellent model system to investigate how changes in drug design impact biological activity, which is an important consideration for rational drug design. Herein we report a new series of imatinib derivatives that in general have greater activity against the family of PDGF receptors and poorer activity against Abl, as a result of modifications of the phenyl and N-methylpiperazine rings. These new compounds provide a platform for further drug development against the therapeutically important PDGF receptor family and they also provide insight into the engineering of drugs with altered biological activity.

18671785|t|Comparison of potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser vaporization of the prostate and transurethral resection of the prostate: update of a prospective non-randomized two-centre study.
18671785|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the intermediate-term clinical efficacy and the rate of complications in 80 W photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) with the potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser (Greenlight, (AMS, Minnetonka, MN, USA) compared with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in a prospective non-randomised two-centre study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 2003 to August 2006, 396 patients (PVP 269, TURP 127) with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia were included in the study. There was a significant difference in mean age (72 years for PVP vs 68 for TURP, P = 0.001). Patients were therefore stratified in age categories (<70, 70-80, >80 years) and compared for perioperative variables, functional outcome and complications, with a follow-up of up to 24 months. RESULTS: The mean prostate size was greater (overall, 62 vs 48 mL, P < 0.001) and mean operative duration longer (overall 72 vs 53 min; P = 0.001) for PVP in all age categories. The rate of intraoperative bleeding (3% vs 11%), blood transfusions (0% vs 5.5%) and capsule perforations (0.4% vs 6.3%), and early postoperative clot retention (0.4% vs 3.9%) was significantly lower for PVP. Hospitalization time was significantly shorter in the PVP group for patients aged <70 years (3.0 vs 4.7 days) and 70-80 years (4.0 vs 5.0 days; P = 0.001). The improvement of peak urinary flow rate was higher after TURP for any age category. The International Prostate Symptom Score and postvoid residual volume during the follow-up showed no significant difference. After 12 months the overall prostate size reduction was 63% (-30 mL) after TURP and 44% (-27 mL) after PVP. The rate of repeat TURP/PVP was higher in the PVP group (6.7% vs 3.9%, not significant) within the follow-up of up to 2 years. The incidence of urethral and bladder neck strictures was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: PVP was more favourable in terms of perioperative safety. Although patients assigned for PVP were older and had larger prostates, PVP resulted in a similar functional outcome. Further follow-up is needed to draw final conclusions about the long-term efficacy of PVP.

10549098|t|Tacrolimus toxicity due to drug interaction with mibefradil in a patient after liver transplantation.
10549098|a|A 54-year-old male liver transplant patient received mibefradil, a novel T-type calcium channel blocker, as antihypertensive treatment while he was on tacrolimus. He subsequently developed dizziness and fatigue of gradual onset as well as shoulder muscle ache. In addition, reversible impairment of renal function occurred with an increase in creatinine and potassium levels. Monitoring of tacrolimus levels, which had been in the desired range (5-8 ng/ml) until recently, revealed an increase to toxic level of 54 ng/ml. After discontinuation of mibefradil, tacrolimus levels returned to the normal range and all symptoms and clinical changes were reversible. Mibefradil and tacrolimus both are metabolized through the cytochrome--P-450 pathway. We suspect that drug interaction due to competitive inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism by mibefradil was responsible for these toxic effects. Therefore, special caution is recommended when administering tacrolimus with other drugs that carry the potential for pharmakokinetic interaction.

23406672|t|Sildenafil and diastolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction in patients with preserved ejection fraction: the Sildenafil and Diastolic Dysfunction After Acute Myocardial Infarction (SIDAMI) trial.
23406672|a|BACKGROUND: Diastolic dysfunction is frequently seen after myocardial infarction and is characterized by a disproportionate increase in filling pressure during exercise to maintain stroke volume. We hypothesized that sildenafil would reduce filling pressure during exercise in patients with diastolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients with diastolic dysfunction and near normal left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiography were randomly assigned sildenafil 40 mg thrice daily or matching placebo for 9 weeks. Before randomization and after 9 weeks of treatment patients underwent simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization at rest and during exercise. Primary end point was pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and secondary end points comprised cardiac index and pulmonary arterial pressure at rest and during exercise after 9 weeks. After 9 weeks there were no differences in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at rest (13 ±4 versus 13 ±3 mm Hg, P=0.25) or at peak exercise (35 ±8 mm Hg versus 31 ±7 mm Hg, P=0.07). However, with treatment cardiac index increased at rest (P=0.006) and peak exercise (P=0.02) in the sildenafil group, and systemic vascular resistance index (resting, P=0.0002; peak exercise, P=0.007) and diastolic blood pressure (resting, P=0.005; peak exercise, P=0.02) were lower in the sildenafil group. Resting left ventricular end-diastolic volume index increased (P=0.001) within the sildenafil group but was unchanged in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil did not decrease filling pressure at rest or during exercise in post-myocardial infarction patients with diastolic dysfunction. However, there were effects on secondary end points, which require further studies.

2176168|t|Precorneal residence time in humans of sodium hyaluronate as measured by gamma scintigraphy.
2176168|a|The aim of the present study was to quantify in man the distribution and clearance of two aqueous sodium hyaluronate (SH) solutions of 0.125% and 0.250% after the administration of 25 microliters onto the cornea. Isotonic phosphate buffer (PB) was used as a reference instillation. No systemic or local medication was given to the seven 18- to 30-year-old, healthy male volunteers. A detailed evaluation of the anterior segment of the eye, as well as a Schirmer test and a break-up time measurement, yielded results within the normal range. The clearance of 0.125% and 0.250% SH solutions radiolabelled with sodium pertechnetate Tc-99m was measured by gamma scintigraphy and compared with that of a PB solution tagged with the same radiolabel. There was no statistically significant difference between the quantities of 0.125% SH and PB solutions remaining in the precorneal space at 20 min (paired t-test, P = 0.78, n = 7). However, in comparing the 0.250% SH with the PB solution, we observed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.01, n = 7) in the amount remaining in the precorneal space after the same interval. Actually, 53% of the radiolabelled 0.250% SH solution remained on the cornea as compared with 30% for the 0.125% SH solution and 18.3% for the PB solution. These results suggest that an SH solution of 0.250% might have a prolonged residence time on the precorneal surface, and that SH could therefore be used as an additive in various drug-release systems for the eye.

22450429|t|The relationship between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and ischaemic and bleeding outcomes in stable outpatients: the CHARISMA genetics study.
22450429|a|AIMS: Clinical trials have established the value of clopidogrel therapy in a wide spectrum of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Both loss- and gain-of-function single nucleotide variants of CYP2C19 genes have been identified that affect clopidogrel metabolism and anti-platelet response. We sought to determine the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on ischaemic and bleeding events. METHODS AND RESULTS: A subset of patients from the Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial who consented to genotyping was analysed. Patients with clinically evident cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors were enrolled in the trial. The rates of ischaemic and bleeding events were compared between carriers and non-carriers of loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles in patients randomized to clopidogrel vs. placebo. A total of 4819 patients were genotyped and available for the analysis. Carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles did not have an increased rate of ischaemic events. However, clopidogrel-treated patients did have a significantly lower rate of any bleeding in carriers: 36.1% (240/665) vs. 42.5% (681/1601) in non-carriers, HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.93, P = 0.003 (genotype/treatment interaction, P-value = 0.023). The CYP2C19 gain-of-function alleles did not affect ischaemic or bleeding endpoints. CONCLUSION: No relationship was seen between CYP2C19 status and ischaemic outcomes in stable patients treated with clopidogrel. There was, however, significantly less bleeding with clopidogrel in carriers of the loss-of-function allele, suggesting less anti-platelet response. Although several prior studies, including mainly stented patients, have emphasized the relationship between CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles and efficacy of clopidogrel, this study of stable patients establishes a potential link with reduced bleeding complications. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00050817.

19203129|t|Supramolecular chemistry on water-soluble carbon nanotubes for drug loading and delivery.
19203129|a|We show that large surface areas exist for supramolecular chemistry on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) prefunctionalized noncovalently or covalently by common surfactant or acid-oxidation routes. Water-soluble SWNTs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalization via these routes allow for surprisingly high degrees of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules, including a cancer drug (doxorubicin) with ultrahigh loading capacity, a widely used fluorescence molecule (fluorescein), and combinations of molecules. Binding of molecules to nanotubes and their release can be controlled by varying the pH. The strength of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules is dependent on nanotube diameter, leading to a method for controlling the release rate of molecules from SWNTs by using nanotube materials with suitable diameter. This work introduces the concept of "functionalization partitioning" of SWNTs, i.e., imparting multiple chemical species, such as PEG, drugs, and fluorescent tags, with different functionalities onto the surface of the same nanotube. Such chemical partitioning should open up new opportunities in chemical, biological, and medical applications of novel nanomaterials.

22512504|t|Platelet-associated angiogenesis regulating factors: a pharmacological perspective.
22512504|a|Platelets, in addition to maintaining hemostasis, also stimulate angiogenesis by generating and releasing, upon activation, factors that promote the growth of new blood vessels. To date, at least 20 angiogenesis-regulating factors have been identified in platelets, including both promoters and inhibitors. Platelet-derived angiogenesis regulators promote angiogenesis during wound healing, tumor growth, and in response to ischemia. Within platelets, angiogenesis regulators are primarily stored in a-granules, but are also found in the cytosol or derived from membrane lipids. Their release can be inhibited pharmacologically by anti-platelet agents, which consequently suppress platelet-stimulated angiogenesis. Several years ago, our research group discovered that platelets generate the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin independent of the activation state of platelets, and that platelet-derived angiostatin serves to limit the angiogenesis-stimulating effects of platelets. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of platelet-associated angiogenesis regulators, how they impact angiogenesis, and how they are controlled pharmacologically.

11474550|t|Vascular and nociceptive effects of localized prolonged sympathetic blockade in human skin.
11474550|a|Supersensitivity to noradrenaline contributes to certain vascular disorders (e.g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). We aimed to develop a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity that could be used to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of guanethidine were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later. the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with guanethidine, indicating that guanethidine had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, guanethidine and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with guanethidine. To investigate the effect of guanethidine pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia. the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0.6% capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with guanethidine or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by guanethidine induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline.

20707732|t|Evolution of mitochondrial DNA content after planned interruption of HAART in HIV-infected pediatric patients.
20707732|a|HAART-related long-term toxicities, many of them ascribed to mitochondrial (mt) toxicity of the nucleoside analogues, are being increasingly reported in HIV-infected children. HIV infection can also cause mt damage. Case series include 13 vertically HIV-infected pediatric patients (9 girls, median age 10.5 years) with optimal long-term response to a first-line HAART regimen who underwent planned treatment interruption (PTI). MtDNA content from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by means of a real-time PCR technique at PTI and 12 months later and expressed as an mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratio, together with lactate levels. At PTI, patients had remained a median time of 4.7 years on HAART and 4.3 years with complete suppression of viral replication. The main reason leading to PTI was treatment fatigue. One month after PTI, HIV plasmatic viral load had increased to 4.8 log copies/ml and stabilized thereafter. During the 12-month study period, all children remained free from any HIV-related clinical event. A progressive and significant decrease in median CD4 cell counts and percentages was observed 12 months after PTI. One year after PTI, the median mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratios had increased from 0.76 to 1.08 (p = 0.002) and lactate levels had decreased (from 1.12 to 0.73 mmol/liter; p = 0.019). Changes in mtDNA did not correlate with changes in lactate levels. No relationship was found between the evolution in mt toxicity markers and the rest of the clinical, immunological, and virological variables. In this series, PTI led to a partial restoration of mtDNA levels and a significant decrease in lactate values.

8398274|t|Oestrogen replacement treatment and the risk of endometrial cancer: an assessment of the role of covariates.
8398274|a|The relationship between oestrogen replacement treatment and the risk of endometrial cancer was analysed in a case-control study of 158 histologically confirmed incident cases below the age of 75 and 468 controls in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic, non-hormone-related conditions conducted in the Swiss Canton of Vaud in 1988-1992. Overall, 60 (38%) cases vs. 93 (20%) controls had ever used oestrogen replacement treatment: the corresponding multiple logistic regression relative risk (RR) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-4.1). The risk was directly related to duration of use, and rose to 5.1 (95% CI: 2.7-9.8) for > 5 year-use. The RR was still significantly elevated 10 or more years after stopping use (RR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5). When the role of covariates was considered, a significant interaction was observed with body mass index (RR for long-term oestrogen use = 6.0 for lean or normal weight women vs. 2.4 for overweight women). There was also a hint of a negative interaction with oral contraceptive (OC) use, since the RR for oestrogens was higher (or restricted) to women who had never used OC (RR = 5.4, for long-term oestrogen use), as compared with those who had used OC, who showed no significant evidence of association with oestrogens (RR = 0.9 for long-term use). There was no significant interaction with cigarette smoking. Thus, this study confirms the presence of a strong association between oestrogen replacement treatment and endometrial cancer risk, since in the late 1980s or early 1990s about 25% of cases could be attributed to oestrogen replacement treatment in this Swiss population. Further, it confirms the presence of significant negative interactions of oestrogen use with obesity, and, possibly, with OC as well.

21327533|t|Medically managed hypercholesterolemia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus preoperatively predicts poor survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer.
21327533|a|INTRODUCTION: Although patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently require medications to treat pre-existing conditions, the impact of these treatments on outcomes post-resection is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of preoperative medications on overall survival after pancreatic resection. METHODS: Multi-institutional data on preoperative medications and outcomes in patients undergoing resection for PDAC were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine which medications were predictive of early mortality. RESULTS: Of the 518 patients resected for PDAC, 13.3% were being treated preoperatively with insulin, 14.8% were on a statin, 1.7% were on steroids, and 7.6% were on thyroxin. On univariate analysis, patients taking preoperative insulin had a higher 90-day mortality rate relative to those not on insulin (13.0% vs. 4.8%, p   =   0.024), and those on a statin had a higher 90-day mortality than those who were not (10.8% vs. 4.6%, p   =   0.035). Preoperative steroids and thyroxin were not associated with 90-day mortality (p   =   0.409 and p   =   0.474, respectively). Insulin and statin use was a stronger predictor of 90-day mortality than history of diabetes (p   =   0.101), BMI   >=    30 (p   =   0.166), cardiac disease (p   =   0.168), pulmonary disease (p   =   1.000), or renal dysfunction (p   =   1.000). Older patients also had a higher risk of early postoperative death (p   =   0.011). On multivariate analysis, only preoperative insulin usage and statin treatment independently predicted early mortality (odds ratio (OR)   =   3.043; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.256-7.372; p   =   0.014, and OR   =   2.529; 95% CI, 1.048-6.104; p   =   0.039, respectively). Based on the beta coefficients, a simple scoring system was devised to predict survival after resection from preoperative medication use. Zero points were assigned to patients who were on neither insulin nor a statin, one point to those who were on one or the other, and two points to those who were on both insulin and a statin. The score correlated with early postoperative survival (90-day mortality rates of 3.4%, 11.5%, and 13.3% for 0, 1, and 2 points, respectively, p   =   0.004). Increasing score was also associated with poorer long-term outcomes, with a median overall survival of 19.6, 15.6, and 11.2  months for 0, 1, and 2 points, respectively (p   =   0.002, median follow-up 14.4  months). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PDAC being treated for pre-existing diabetes or hypercholesterolemia with either insulin or statin-based therapy have an increased risk of early postoperative mortality. A simple scoring system based on preoperative medications can be used to predict early and overall survival following resection.

20843409|t|Toxicity of acrylamide and evaluation of its exposure in baby foods.
20843409|a|Contaminants are a vast subject area of food safety and quality and can be present in our food chain from raw materials to finished products. Acrylamide, an a,b-unsaturated (conjugated) reactive molecule, can be detected as a contaminant in several foodstuffs including baby foods and infant formulas. It is anticipated that children will generally have intakes that are two to three times those of adults when expressed on a body-weight basis. Though exposure to acrylamide is inevitable, it is necessary to protect infant and children from high exposure. The present review focuses on the several adverse health effects of acrylamide including mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, and the possible outcomes of childhood exposure from baby foods and infant formulas.

10435050|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor up-regulates nitric oxide synthase expression in endothelial cells.
10435050|a|OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), secreted by vascular cells and a variety of tumour cells, is a potent angiogenic factor. Since nitric oxide (NO) seems to play a key role in the VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells, the aim of the present study was to determine whether VEGF stimulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression and hence results in a maintained increase in NO formation. METHODS: Experiments were performed using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and isolated rat aortic rings. eNOS expression was assessed by Western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Exposure of either confluent HUVEC or rat aortic rings to VEGF165 significantly increased eNOS mRNA and protein levels. This stimulatory effect of VEGF165 on eNOS expression was associated with an elevation in the basal production of cGMP in HUVEC, and with a leftward shift of the concentration-relaxation curve to acetylcholine in aortic rings. The VEGF-induced increase in eNOS mRNA levels was abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggesting involvement of a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. Since eNOS mRNA levels remained elevated in VEGF-treated cells in the presence of actinomycin D. it is likely that the VEGF-induced up-regulation of eNOS expression may be a consequence of a post-transcriptional effect on eNOS mRNA stability. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that VEGF enhances the expression of eNOS in native and cultured endothelial cells, an effect which may be important in the process of VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

18603980|t|Prescribing patterns in the orthopaedics outpatient department in a teaching hospital in Pokhara, western Nepal.
18603980|a|OBJECTIVES: Information on the utilization patterns of drugs in the orthopaedics outpatient department (OPD) are lacking in hospitals in western Nepal. The present study was carried out to obtain demographic information about the respondents selected for analysis, information on the average number of drugs prescribed and the average cost of drugs per prescription. The prescriptions were critically analyzed using predetermined criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out over a four-month period (01.09.2002 to 31.12.2002) at the Manipal Teaching hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. The percentage of encounters with an injection or an antibiotic prescribed was noted. The percentage of drugs prescribed from the Essential drug list of Nepal and the mean cost of drugs per prescription was calculated. RESULTS: 1238 patients attended the orthopaedics OPD during the study period. 186 prescriptions were randomly selected for analysis. The mean number of drugs per prescription was 1.9. Low backache was the most common reason for attending the OPD. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most commonly prescribed drug group. Diclofenac and meloxicam were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Mean cost of drugs was 166.2 Nepalese rupees. Injections and antibiotics were prescribed in 16 (8.6%) and 7 (3.8%) encounters respectively. 51 prescriptions (27.4%) had various problems. Absence of diagnosis on the prescriptions and the duration of treatment were most commonly observed. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage of prescribing by generic name was low. Educational sessions for the doctors at different levels to encourage prescribing by generic names and on correct writing of prescriptions may be considered. Studies covering a larger number of patients and for a longer time period are required. A greater number of patients can be studied, seasonal variations can be overcome and drug utilization can be measured quantitatively.

9250819|t|Variability in determination of body weight used for dosing busulphan and cyclophosphamide in adult patients: results of an international survey.
9250819|a|Fifty-two BMT institutions were sent a questionnaire asking for details of dosing for busulphan, cyclophosphamide (bu-cy), cyclosporin and methotrexate (CSA-MTX). The following data were requested: (a) the method used to determine the body weight for dosage calculations (b) the actual dose per weight and (c) the schedule of administration. Thirty-six (69%) institutions responded and 33 were evaluable. There was substantial variation in the method used to determine weight for bu-cy. No single method was used in more than 30% of units, although most units made some allowance for discrepancies between actual and ideal body weight. There was more uniformity in the method of weight determination for CSA-MTX, with the majority of units using actual body weight. Conversely, there was much more variation in the dose per weight formulae and schedules used for CSA-MTX than for bu-cy. These substantial differences highlight the importance of specifying these criteria when the toxicity and efficacy of chemotherapy regimens is reported and the need for further studies to determine the optimal weight formulae for dosage calculations.

19193572|t|Randomized trial assessing the effectiveness of a pharmacist-delivered program for smoking cessation.
19193572|a|BACKGROUND: As trained and accessible healthcare professionals, pharmacists are in an ideal position to provide tobacco cessation interventions. Of the 15 studies identified in the literature assessing the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions delivered by pharmacists, this is the first randomized controlled trial conducted in the US of a pharmacist-delivered program for smoking cessation using biochemical confirmation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness on smoking cessation of a face-to-face group program conducted by the pharmacist team compared with a brief standard care session delivered by a pharmacist over the telephone. METHODS: An open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration, community-based outpatient clinic in the Rocky Mountain region. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 3-session face-to-face group program conducted by the pharmacist team or one 5- to 10-minute standard care session delivered by the pharmacist team over the telephone. Participants in both groups were offered either immediate-release bupropion or nicotine patch at no cost. The primary outcome of self-reported abstinence was biochemically confirmed by urinary cotinine at 6 months after the quit date. RESULTS: One hundred one smokers were randomized from October 3, 2005, to March 30, 2007, with the last 6-month follow-up survey completed on November 6, 2007. Analysis of data was completed in December 2007. Using intent-to-treat procedures, confirmed abstinence rates at the end of 6 months were 28% in the pharmacist-delivered face-to-face treatment group and 11.8% in the standard care telephone session control group (p < 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pharmacists are effective providers of tobacco cessation interventions. Greater utilization of pharmacists in tobacco cessation efforts could have a significant impact on smoking rates, prevention of tobacco-related diseases, and overall improvement in public health across the US.

14668688|t|Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: mechanism of obstruction and response to therapy.
14668688|a|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary, usually familial, disorder of heart muscle whose primary feature is muscular hypertrophy without recognized cause that encroaches on the ventricular chamber, reducing chamber area and volume. In roughly 25% of cases, there is associated obstruction to left ventricular outflow (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [HOCM]). This article details the mechanism of obstruction in HOCM, focusing on obstruction at the mitral valve level, and reviews the pharmacologic and surgical therapies currently available. Mainstays of pharmacologic therapy include b-blockers, calcium channel blockers (verapamil in particular), and/or disopyramide. Surgical therapies include septal myotomy/myectomy, which has become the gold standard to which other therapies are compared, and mitral valve replacement. During the past 10 years, atrio-ventricular sequential pacing and alcohol septal ablation have been proposed as less invasive alternatives to surgery. A single, optimal therapy for patients with HOCM and refractory symptoms has not been established, and decisions regarding surgical versus noninvasive therapies need to be individualized based on functional status, comorbidities, local expertise in the surgical and nonsurgical techniques, and patient preference.

10202608|t|3H-spiperone binding to lymphocytes in neuroleptic-naive-schizophrenia and the effect of neuroleptic treatment.
10202608|a|The aim of this study was to determine whether spiperone binding to lymphocytes could serve as a biological marker of susceptibility to schizophrenia and schizophrenic spectrum disorders or as a measure of response to neuroleptic treatment. Lymphocyte spiperone binding parameters (Bmax, KD) were assessed in 13 patients with schizophrenia and 4 patients with schizotypal personality disorder, all neuroleptic naive, and in 19 age- and sex-matched control subjects. A repeated determination was carried out in 11 of the schizophrenic subjects after several months of neuroleptic treatment. In addition, the binding characteristics of 12 of the schizophrenic/schizotypal patients were compared with those of 13 healthy family members and normal unrelated controls. No significant differences were detected between the schizophrenic subjects and controls before or after neuroleptic treatment or between the patients and their non-affected family members and controls.

24365797|t|Is ovarian hyperstimulation associated with higher blood pressure in 4-year-old IVF offspring? Part I: multivariable regression analysis.
24365797|a|STUDY QUESTION: Does ovarian hyperstimulation, the in vitro procedure, or a combination of these two negatively influence blood pressure (BP) and anthropometrics of 4-year-old children born following IVF? SUMMARY ANSWER: Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) percentiles were found in 4-year-old children born following conventional IVF with ovarian hyperstimulation compared with children born following IVF without ovarian hyperstimulation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increasing evidence suggests that IVF, which has an increased incidence of preterm birth and low birthweight, is associated with higher BP and altered body fat distribution in offspring but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a prospective, assessor-blinded follow-up study in which 194 children were assessed. The attrition rate up until the 4-year-old assessment was 10%. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We measured BP and anthropometrics of 4-year-old singletons born following conventional IVF with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH-IVF, n = 63), or born following modified natural cycle IV (MNC-IVF, n = 52), or born to subfertile couples who conceived naturally (Sub-NC, n = 79). Both IVF and ICSI were performed. Primary outcome measures were the SBP percentiles and diastolic BP (DBP) percentiles. Anthropometric measures included triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. Several multivariable regression analyses were applied in order to correct for subsets of confounders. The value 'B' is the unstandardized regression coefficient. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: SBP percentiles were significantly lower in the MNC-IVF group (mean 59, SD 24) than in the COH-IVF (mean 68, SD 22) and Sub-NC groups (mean 70, SD 16). The difference in SBP between COH-IVF and MNC-IVF remained significant after correction for current, early life and parental characteristics (B: 14.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.39-22.79), whereas the difference between MNC-IVF and Sub-NC did not. DBP percentiles did not differ between groups. After correction for early life factors, subscapular skinfold thickness was thicker in the COH-IVF group than in the Sub-NC group (B: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.03-0.53). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Larger study groups are necessary to draw firm conclusions. An effect of gender or ICSI could not be properly investigated as stratifying would further reduce the sample size. We corrected for the known differences between MNC-IVF and COH-IVF but it is possible that the groups differ in additional, more subtle parental characteristics. In addition, we measured BP on 1 day only, had no control group of children born to fertile couples (precluding investigating effects of the underlying subfertility) and included singletons only. As COH-IVF is associated with multiple births we may have underestimated cardiometabolic problems after COH-IVF. Finally, multivariable regression analysis does not provide clear insight in the causal mechanisms and we have performed further explorative analyses. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings are in line with other studies describing adverse effects of IVF on cardiometabolic outcome but this is the first study suggesting that ovarian hyperstimulation, as used in IVF treatments, could be a causative mechanism. Perhaps ovarian hyperstimulation negatively influences cardiometabolic outcome via changes in the early environment of the oocyte and/or embryo that result in epigenetic modifications of key metabolic systems that are involved in BP regulation. Future research needs to assess further the role of ovarian hyperstimulation in poorer cardiometabolic outcome and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The findings emphasize the importance of cardiometabolic monitoring of the growing number of children born following IVF. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. The study was supported by the University Medical Center Groningen, the Cornelia Foundation and the school for Behavioral- and Cognitive Neurosciences. The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report.

23529134|t|Proteomic characterization of hepatitis C eradication: enzyme switch in the healing liver.
23529134|a|Lipid pathway impairment, decrease in the antioxidant pool and downregulation in amino-acid metabolism are just some of the metabolic variations attributed to chronic HCV infection. All of them have been studied separately, mainly in animal models. Thanks to proteomic analysis we managed to describe (for the fist time to the best of our knowledge), in vivo and in humans, the metabolic alterations caused by HCV, and the recovery of the same alterations during HCV treatment. We performed proteomic analysis on liver specimens of a 28-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C genotype 1a, alcoholism and diabetes mellitus type 1, before and after antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2b and ribavirin. The subject, thanks to a patient-tailored therapy, reached Sustained Virological Response. Throughout the treatment period the patient was monitored with subsequent biochemical, clinical and psychological examinations. The data obtained by the patient's close monitoring suggest a direct interaction between insulin resistance and an active HCV genotype 1 infection, with a leading role played by the infection, and not by insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the sharp fall of the insulin units needed per day during treatment. The proteomic analysis showed that after therapy, a downregulation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alcohol catabolism takes place, the latter probably due to cessation of alcohol abuse. On the contrary, the metabolic pathways linked to metabolism of the reactive oxygen species were upregulated after therapy. Finally, a significant alteration in the pathway regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver, was reported. These "real time" data confirm in vivo, in humans, that during HCV infection, the pathways related to fatty acids, glucose metabolism and free radical scavenging are inhibited. The same enzyme deficit is completely recovered after HCV eradication.

8341619|t|Gonorrhea. Finding and treating a moving target.
8341619|a|Gonorrhea is the most common reportable disease in the United States. In recent years, the epidemiology of this infection has changed as a result of increasing drug abuse, exchange of money and drugs for sex, and sexual promiscuity among teenagers, particularly blacks. Significant numbers of asymptomatic male carriers have been identified, which presents an additional challenge to disease control. Gonococcal infection has become increasingly resistant to traditional antibiotic therapy and now requires the use of newer, more expensive agents. Single-dose oral treatment with cefixime (Suprax) or a quinolone appears to be effective, safe, and practical for patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. Serious infection and new syndromes caused by gonococci continue to be reported. Because disseminated infections can be fatal, hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone sodium (Rocephin) or cefotaxime sodium (Claforan) are required.

20459362|t|Management of tics and Tourette's disorder: an update.
20459362|a|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Tic disorders are fairly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders. While a proportion of children may not present to the clinician's office for management of tic disorders, another proportion may present with severe symptoms that impair social and occupational functioning. A combination of psychosocial interventions and pharmacological approaches are required in these cases. While alpha-2 agonists and dopamine antagonists constitute the mainstay of pharmacological agents for tic disorders, advances in neurobiology and psychopharmacology have discovered newer avenues for treatment of tic disorders. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Apart from reviewing evidence based literature and recent updates on alpha-2 agonists and dopamine antagonists in treating tic disorders, the review also includes novel treatment approaches such as glutamate modulators, nicotinic agents, antiandrogens and botulinum injection. In addition, a brief overview of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and habit reversal training is also provided. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: A clear and concise review of the therapeutic options and advances in management of tic disorders. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: In addition to psychosocial interventions, alpha-2 agonists and dopamine antagonists constitute the mainstay of treatment approaches for treating tic disorders. Additional treatment options such as ropinirole, pramipexole and tetrabenazine may be useful if patients do not respond to the primary agents. Severe intractable cases might need a referral to specialist centers to consider the possibility of using ECT, TMS or DBS.

9110114|t|Medical treatment of heart failure: the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Consensus Conference revisited.
9110114|a|The report of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Consensus Conference on the diagnosis and management of heart failure was published in 1994. Focusing on the chronic medical treatment of patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, we summarize and update the consensus recommendations in the light of the results of several more recent studies. While the positive treatment recommendations are still fully valid or even reinforced by these new data, a somewhat more liberal use of beta-blockers, amiodarone, and newer calcium channel blockers seems justified.

10516875|t|Midazolam treatment of acute and refractory status epilepticus.
10516875|a|Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency requiring prompt resolution. Acute treatment is often delayed by difficulty in obtaining intravenous (i.v.) access. Refractory GCSE is often difficult to treat, and traditional therapy with barbiturates induces hypotension and respiratory depression and prolongs recovery. Midazolam is particularly useful for treating acute GCSE because it has an imidazole ring that is open at low pH, allowing it to be dissolved in aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, but closed at physiologic pH, increasing lipophilicity and rendering good intramuscular absorption, brain penetration, and fast onset of action. When given intramuscularly as a 0.2 mg/kg bolus, it has efficacy at least equal to that of i.v. diazepam, is well tolerated, induces little respiratory compromise, and has a shorter latency to onset of action. Therefore, it should be considered for the treatment of acute GCSE when i.v. access is problematic. For refractory GCSE, continuous i.v. midazolam infusion at 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/hr after a 0.2 mg/kg i.v. bolus is effective and has advantages over traditional therapies because it induces less hypotension and cardiorespiratory depression and can be easily titrated. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of continuous i.v. midazolam compared to other contemporary therapies.

12532277|t|17beta-estradiol and tamoxifen regulate a maxi-chloride channel from human placenta.
12532277|a|Steroid hormones have been implicated in the modulation of several transport processes, including conductive chloride transport in epithelial cells. Micromolar concentrations of these hormones have been determined in blood of pregnant women. The purpose of this work was to explore the effects of 17beta-Estradiol, a steroid hormone, on the biophysical properties of the Maxi chloride channel present in apical membranes from human placental syncytiotrophoblast. Apical membrane chloride channels from human term placentas were reconstituted in giant liposomes suitable for electrophysiologic studies by the patch-clamp method. Low micromolar concentrations of 17beta-Estradiol inhibit the Maxi chloride channels in excised patches in a potential-dependent manner. The addition of 1 mM 17beta-Estradiol to the bath solution decreased the total current in the patch from 100% control to 71% at -40 mV holding potential and the current was not affected by 17beta-Estradiol at + 40 mV. However, the presence of the hormone did not affect the single-channel conductance, therefore its effect must be due to modulation of its open probability (Po). Interestingly, 17alpha-Estradiol did not change the total current in the patch. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen, also showed inhibition, but in a voltage-independent manner. Our results suggest that the Maxi Cl- channel from human term placenta may be regulated by direct interaction of both compounds with the channel. From a functional point of view, the control of these channels by steroid hormones may be of great importance in placental physiology and their regulation may help to unravel their possible role in transplacental transport.

14654938|t|Identification of CRASH, a gene deregulated in gynecological tumors.
14654938|a|We have identified CRASH, a human asparaginase-like protein which is composed of 308 amino acids and exhibits 32% homology to human aspartylglucosaminadase at the amino acid level. Database analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to CRASH is composed of 7 exons and 6 introns. Steady-state level of CRASH mRNA was found to be increased in 5 cell lines derived from metastatic lesions compared with 2 cell lines derived from primary mammary carcinoma and HMEC (human mammary epithelial cells). We found that the mRNA level of CRASH correlates with the metastatic propensity of several isogenic human colon cancer and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. CRASH corresponds to a recently identified sperm autoantigen and furthermore we have demonstrated inducibility of CRASH mRNA by androgen and progesterone. Investigation of several types of human cancers and their corresponding normal tissues revealed high levels of CRASH mRNA in uterine, mammary and ovarian tumors compared with the corresponding normal tissues. CRASH mRNA expression was analysed in breast cancer samples with disclosed clinico-pathological features and corresponding normal tissues. The levels of CRASH mRNA were significantly up-regulated in tumors compared with normal breast tissues and correlate with lack of estrogen receptor expression of the tumors.

8996518|t|Therapeutic efficacy of the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-(4-[1-piperidino]-1-piperidino)-carbonyloxy-camptothecin against pediatric and adult central nervous system tumor xenografts.
8996518|a|Therapy of patients with malignant central nervous system tumors is frequently unsuccessful, reflecting limitations of current surgical, radiotherapeutic, and pharmacotherapeutic treatments. The camptothecin derivative irinotecan (CPT-11) has been shown to possess antitumor activity in phase II trials for patients with carcinoma of the lung, cervix, ovary, colon, or rectum and for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The current study was designed to test the efficacy of the drug against a panel of human tumor xenografts derived from adult and pediatric central nervous system malignancies. Tumors included childhood high-grade gliomas (D-212 MG, D-456 MG), adult high-grade gliomas (D-54 MG, D-245 MG), medulloblastomas (D341 Med, D487 Med), ependymomas (D528 EP, D612 EP), and a rhabdomyosarcoma (TE-671), as well as sublines with demonstrated resistance to busulfan (D-456 MG (BR)), cyclophosphamide (TE-671 CR), procarbazine (D-245 MG (PR)) or melphalan (TE-671 MR), growing subcutaneously and intracranially in athymic nude mice. In replicate experiments, CPT-11 was given at a dosage of 40 mg/kg per dose via intraperitoneal injection in 10% dimethylsulfoxide on days 1-5 and 8-12, which is the dosage lethal to 10% of treated animals. CPT-11 produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) growth delays in all subcutaneous xenografts tested, including those resistant to busulfan, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, and melphalan, with growth delays ranging from 21.3 days in D487 Med to 90+ days in several tumor lines. Further, tumor regression was evident in every treated animal bearing a subcutaneous tumor, with some xenografts yielding complete tumor regression. Statistically significant (P < 0.001) increases in survival were demonstrated in the two intracranial xenografts-D341 EP (73.0% increase) and D-456 MG (114.2% increase)-treated with CPT-11. These studies demonstrate that, of over 40 drugs evaluated in this laboratory, CPT-11 is the most active against central nervous system xenografts and should be advanced to clinical trial as soon as possible.

21135954|t|Novel benzyl-substituted N-heterocyclic carbene-silver acetate complexes: synthesis, cytotoxicity and antibacterial studies.
21135954|a|From the reaction of 1-methylimidazole (1a), 4,5-dichloro-1H-imidazole (1b(I)) and 1-methylbenzimidazole (1c) with p-cyanobenzyl bromide (2a), non-symmetrically substituted N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [(3a-c)] precursors, 5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazole (1d) and 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (1e) with p-cyanobenzyl bromide (2a) and benzyl bromide (2b), symmetrically substituted N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [(3d-f)] precursors were synthesised. These NHC-precursors were then reacted with silver(i) acetate to yield the NHC-silver complexes (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4a), (4,5-dichloro-1-(4-cyanobenzyl)-3-methyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4b), (1-methyl-3-(4-cyanobenzyl)benzimidazole-2-ylidene)silver(i)acetate (4c), (1,3-bis(4-cyanobenzyl)5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4d), (1,3-dibenzyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4e) and (1,3-dibenzyl-4,5-diphenylimidazol-2-ylidene) silver(i) acetate (4f) respectively. Three NHC-precursors 3c-e and four NHC-silver complexes 4b and 4d-f were characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Preliminary in vitro antibacterial activity of the NHC-precursors and NHC-silver complexes was investigated against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli using the qualitative Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion method. NHC-silver complexes have shown very high antibacterial activity compared to the NHC-precursors. All six NHC-silver complexes were tested for their cytotoxicity through MTT based in vitro tests on the human renal-cancer cell line Caki-1 in order to determine their IC    values. NHC-silver complexes 4a-f were found to have IC    values of 6.2 ( ±1.0), 7.7 ( ±1.6), 1.2 ( ±0.6), 10.8 ( ±1.9), 24.2 ( ±1.8) and 13.6 ( ±1.0) µM, respectively. These values represent improved cytotoxicity against Caki-1, most notably for 4c, which is a three times more cytotoxic than cisplatin (IC    value = 3.3 µM) itself.

20807855|t|Assessment of patient exposure to X-radiation from SPECT/CT scanners.
20807855|a|In the operation of any SPECT/CT system, in addition to internal radiation exposure (gamma-ray) resulting from administration of radiopharmaceuticals, external radiation exposure (x-ray) from the CT device has to be taken into consideration in the light of recommendations from the International Commission on Radiological Protection. These recommendations include justification of practices (the use of radiation produces sufficient benefit to offset any risks caused by the use of radiation), optimization (the incurred exposure by the use of radiation should be kept as low as reasonably achievable), and dose limitation. The internal radiation exposures of each organ after administration of radiopharmaceuticals are calculated by the MIRD Committee method. For example, the internal radiation exposure index for brain perfusion scintigraphy is 0.8 mGy/37 MBq for N-isopropyl-4-iodoamphetamine((123)I) hydrochloride or 0.19 mGy/37 MBq for ethyl cysteinate dimer. On the other hand, the external radiation exposure from a CT device is calculated using the CT dose index volume (CTDIvol)--a measured and calculated value unique to the CT scanner and scan parameters used--and a dose-length product, which is obtained from CT conditions and generally used as a reference value for CT radiation exposure. However, CTDIvol and dose-length product are calculated values unique to each device, not the value of external radiation exposures of each organ. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to measure the total (internal plus external) radiation exposure dose from CT. In the present study, using an anthropomorphic phantom for deep-body total absorbed dose measurement, we evaluated the radiation exposure doses (organ-absorbed doses) of each organ under various CT conditions. METHODS: The radiation exposure doses of each organ were measured by inserting thermoluminescent dosimeter elements into the phantom under various CT conditions. RESULTS: The following were brain radiation exposure doses in the head region. For 90 kVp and 25 mAs, 1.39 mGy (CTDIvol, 1.8 mGy), for 90 kVp and 300 mAs, 17.00 mGy (CTDIvol, 21.2 mGy), for 120 kVp and 25 mAs, 3.21 mGy (CTDIvol, 3.8 mGy), for 120 kVp and 300 mAs, 37.79 mGy (CTDIvol, 47.7 mGy), for 140 kVp and 25 mAs, 5.08 mGy (CTDIvol, 5.5 mGy), and for 140 kVp and 300 mAs, 65.07 mGy (CTDIvol, 65.6 mGy). The eye radiation exposure doses were as follows. For 90 kVp and 25 mAs, 1.94 mGy (CTDIvol, 1.8 mGy), for 90 kVp and 300 mAs, 20.31 mGy (CTDIvol, 21.2 mGy), for 120 kVp and 25 mAs, 3.71 mGy (CTDIvol, 3.8 mGy), for 120 kVp and 300 mAs, 49.72 mGy (CTDIvol, 47.7 mGy), for 140 kVp and 25 mAs, 5.44 mGy (CTDIvol, 5.5 mGy), and for 140 kVp and 300 mAs, 69.76 mGy (CTDIvol, 65.6 mGy). In addition, the radiation exposure doses of the cervical, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions were measured in detail. CONCLUSION: Our estimated external radiation exposure doses (x-ray) of each organ under various CT conditions, along with the internal radiation exposure doses (gamma-ray) resulting from the administration of radiopharmaceuticals, seem to be useful as reference values in understanding the radiation exposure doses for performing various nuclear medicine examinations.

12186506|t|Hypothyroidism and cognition: preliminary evidence for a specific defect in memory.
12186506|a|The effect(s) of hypothyroidism on adult brain cognitive function are poorly understood. We performed a series of neuropsychological tests in 13 thyroid cancer patients while they continued to take their usual dose of levothyroxine (LT4) and again after discontinuing thyroid hormone. Three euthyroid subjects were also tested twice to assess the effect of repeated testing on performance. The tests assessed memory, mood, and attentional resources and controlled for the practice effects of repeated testing. The mean thyrotropin (TSH) on LT4 was 0.56 +/- 0.76 mU/L and while hypothyroid was 69 +/- 33 mU/L. While hypothyroid, the mean Beck depression score was significantly higher (15.31 +/- 9.41 hypothyroid vs. 7.31 +/- 4.82 on LT4) and the subjects rated themselves worse relative to functional memory, concentration, thinking, alertness, and motivation. Hypothyroidism was associated with a decrease in retrieval from memory (p = 0.0034), and this effect could not be attributed to depression or to practice effects. Thyroid state did not affect immediate recall, verbal learning, inhibitory efficiency, information processing speed, or attention switching. Athyrosis is associated with a decrement in delayed recall of verbal information but not in other objective measures of cognition, suggesting that the memory decrement of hypothyroidism is not caused by a generalized reduction in attentional resources.

22541957|t|A phase II study of submandibular gland transfer prior to radiation for prevention of radiation-induced xerostomia in head-and-neck cancer (RTOG 0244).
22541957|a|PURPOSE: We report the results of a phase II study to determine the reproducibility of a submandibular salivary gland transfer (SGT) surgical technique for prevention of radiation (XRT)-induced xerostomia in a multi-institutional setting and to assess severity of xerostomia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had surgery for primary, neck dissection, and SGT, followed by XRT, during which the transferred salivary gland was shielded. Intensity modulated radiation therapy, amifostine, and pilocarpine were not allowed, but postoperative chemotherapy was allowed. Each operation was reviewed by 2 reviewers and radiation by 1 reviewer. If 13 or more (of 43) were "not per protocol," then the technique would be considered not reproducible as per study design. The secondary endpoint was the rate of acute xerostomia, grade 2 or higher, and a rate of  <= 51% was acceptable. RESULTS: Forty-four of the total 49 patients were analyzable: male (81.8%), oropharynx (63.6%), stage IV (61.4%), median age 56.5 years. SGT was "per protocol" or within acceptable variation in 34 patients (77.3%) and XRT in 79.5%. Nine patients (20.9%) developed grade 2 acute xerostomia; 2 had grade 0-1 xerostomia (4.7%) but started on amifostine/pilocarpine. Treatment for these 11 patients (25.6%) was considered a failure for the xerostomia endpoint. Thirteen patients died; median follow-up for 31 surviving patients was 2.9 years. Two-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 76.4% and 71.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of submandibular SGT is reproducible in a multicenter setting. Seventy-four percent of patients were prevented from XRT-induced acute xerostomia.

11800081|t|Effective maintenance leukocytapheresis for patients with steroid dependent or resistant ulcerative colitis.
11800081|a|We prospectively examined the effect of leukocytapheresis (LA) on the maintenance of remission in 7 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who were initially refractory to corticosteroid therapy (steroid resistant or steroid dependent). The patients with refractory UC had been in remission due to LA (induction LA) in combination with the steroid therapy. They were then treated with LA once or twice a month for the purpose of maintaining remission (maintenance LA). The maintenance LA was performed by either a centrifuge method in 5 patients or a polyester adsorbent column method in 2 patients. Steroid dosage was gradually tapered as little as possible without recurrence based on clinical and/or colonoscopical judgments. Four patients were maintained in remission without steroids over 12 months. Recurrence was observed in 3 patients at 3, 3, and 6 months after the beginning of the maintenance LA, respectively. Two of the 3 patients were again conducted to remission by the second induction LA and maintained in remission by the second maintenance LA. Two patients finally underwent total colectomy because of recurrence of UC in a severe form. It is concluded that the maintenance LA therapy might be effective in some patients with steroid dependent or resistant UC for the maintenance of remission without steroids.

17979645|t|Painting the target around the arrow: two-step prodrug therapies from a carbohydrate chemist's perspective.
17979645|a|Selective accumulation of an exogenous enzyme or activating agent at a target cell allows use of prodrugs that will be unmasked only at this site. This can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and allow more potent drugs to be used in various treatments. Examples of this two-step prodrug therapy include antibody- (ADEPT, ADAPT), genetic- (GDEPT, VDEPT) and macromolecule-based approaches (PDEPT, LEAPT). Carbohydrate chemistry and glycobiology feature in each of these areas and is the focus of this review.

9625322|t|Oral L-ornithine-L-aspartate therapy of chronic hepatic encephalopathy: results of a placebo-controlled double-blind study.
9625322|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: In the current state of knowledge of the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy, a reduction in hyperammonemia is the most important evidence of effective treatment. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of oral L-ornithine-L-aspartate, which improves impaired ammonia detoxification, was investigated in patients with cirrhosis, hyperammonemia and stable, overt, chronic hepatic encephalopathy, and in subclinical hepatic encephalopathy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Oral L-ornithine-L-aspartate was administered three times daily at fixed times for 14 consecutive days in a total dose of 18 g per day. The design was chosen to prevent an increase in ammonia induced by a protein meal of 0.25 g/kg body weight, given at the start of the daily treatment period. Efficacy variables were: fasting and postprandial ammonia concentration, Number-Connection-Test time, mental state grades, and a Portosystemic Encephalopathy Index. Analyses were based on the total study sample of 32 placebo- and 34 L-ornithine-L-aspartate-treated patients as well as on the subgroup samples in the overt (20 placebo- and 23 L-ornithine-L-aspartate-treated) and subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (12 placebo- and 11 L-ornithine-L-aspartate-treated) patients. RESULTS: Number Connection Test performance times (p<0.01) as well as fasting (p<0.01) and postprandial (p<0.05) venous blood ammonia concentrations in the L-ornithine-L-aspartate-treated group showed improvement in comparison to placebo. Also, the mental state grade (p<0.05) and the Portosystemic Encephalopathy Index (p<0.01), improved to a much greater degree in the L-ornithine-L-aspartate group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were observed in neither the placebo nor the L-ornithine-L-aspartate-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Oral L-ornithine-L-aspartate is a safe, well-tolerated treatment with a good compliance rate and a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients with cirrhosis and stable, overt, chronic hepatic encephalopathy.

2256716|t|Response of human endometrium and ovarian carcinoma cell-lines to photodynamic therapy.
2256716|a|The response of the human gynecological carcinoma cell-lines HEC-1-A (endometrial carcinoma) and OvCar-3 (ovarian carcinoma) to photodynamic therapy in vitro was examined. The porphyrin compound Photosan III (Ph III) was used for photosensitization of the cells after incubation times of 24 h (HEC-1-A) and 48 h (HEC-1-A and OvCar-3). The Ph III doses varied from 0-10 micrograms/ml medium. Irradiation was performed with laser light at 630 nm. Irradiation doses up to 20 J/cm2 were applied at an irradiance of 40-100 mW/cm2. Cell vitality of the untreated control groups and of the therapy group was determined 48 h after irradiation, using the trypan blue exclusion test. The experimental results show that treatment of OvCar-3 cells with 10 J/cm2 resulted in a decrease in vitality dependent on photosensitizer dose (0-5 micrograms/ml, 48 h incubation time) but independent of the irradiance (40-100 mW/cm2). Complete cell death was observed after application of irradiation doses in the range of 5-20 J/cm2 combined with drug concentrations of 10-2.5 micrograms/ml, at a fixed incubation time of 48 h. HEC-1-A cells did not survive photodynamic therapy with 10 J/cm2 after incubation with 5 micrograms/ml for 48 h. After a shorter incubation time of 24 h, 10 micrograms/ml Ph III was necessary for the same effect. There was a maximum decrease in cell vitality when measured 48 h after irradiation. This was not improved at 72 h.

15183112|t|Oxidative stress response of tumor cells: microarray-based comparison between artemisinins and anthracyclines.
15183112|a|The antimalarial artemisinins also reveal profound cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Artemisinins harbor an endoperoxide bridge whose cleavage results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or artemisinin carbon-centered free radicals. Established cancer drugs such as anthracyclines also form ROS and free radicals that are responsible for the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. In contrast, artemisinins do not reveal cardiotoxicity. In the present investigation, we compared the cytotoxic activities of different artemisinins (artemisinin, artesunate, arteether, artemether, artemisitene, dihydroartemisinylester stereoisomers) in 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, with those of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, 4'-epirubicin, idarubicin, deoxydoxorubicin, trifluoroacetyl-doxorubicin-14-valerate). The inhibition concentration 50% (IC(50)) values of artemisinins and anthracyclines were correlated with the mRNA expression of 170 genes involved in oxygen stress response and metabolism as recently determined by microarray analysis and deposited in the NCI database (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov). The genes whose expression was significantly linked to cellular drug response in Kendall's tau tests were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping. Mathematical correction for false-positive correlations was done by a false discovery rate algorithm. One cluster contained predominantly genes with a relationship to artemisinins and another one genes with a relationship to anthracyclines. In a third cluster, genes correlating to both drug classes were assembled. This indicates that different sets of genes involved in oxidative stress response and metabolism may contribute to the cytotoxic and differing toxic side effects of these drug classes.

8412049|t|Nedocromil sodium in the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in athletes with asthma.
8412049|a|The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of nedocromil sodium in the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) in 13 top athletes affected by bronchial asthma. At a dose of 4 mg the drug significantly reduced the fall in FEV1 compared with placebo but not with respect to basal values. In 9 athletes, 4 mg nedocromil sodium produced a good protective effect and reduced the mean fall in FEV1 to 4% with respect to baseline values, while in the remaining 4 subjects, the protective effect was not satisfactory. In these 4 "non responders" 6 mg nedocromil was effective, and in 2 cases induced prolonged bronchodilatation. In conclusion, the effect of nedocromil sodium in the prevention of EIB may be dose-dependent in relation to the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity or to interference of other factors.

25048254|t|Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.
25048254|a|The FDA approvals of enzalutamide and abiraterone have rapidly changed the clinical landscape of prostate cancer treatment. Both drugs were designed to further suppress androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is restored following first-line androgen deprivation therapies. Resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone, however, is again marked by a return of AR signaling, indicating a remarkable "addiction" of prostate cancer cells to the AR pathway. Several mechanisms of castration resistance have been uncovered in the past decades, featuring a wide spectrum of molecular alterations that may explain sustained AR signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). Among these, the androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs), particularly variant 7 (AR-V7), have been implicated in resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in preclinical studies, and they cannot be targeted by currently available AR-directed drugs. Drug development for AR-V-associated CRPC may therefore be necessary to augment the preexisting treatment repertoire. In this mini-review, we will discuss general mechanisms of resistance to AR-directed therapies, with a focus on the role of androgen receptor splice variants in the new era of treating advanced prostate cancer with enzalutamide and abiraterone.

21442636|t|Circulating levels of MCP-1, sIL-2R, IL-15, and IL-8 predict anemia response to pomalidomide therapy in myelofibrosis.
21442636|a|Cytokine-phenotype associations have recently been described in primary myelofibrosis and increased levels of IL-8, sIL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 were found to be independently predictive of inferior survival. Pomalidomide therapy is effective for alleviating anemia in myelofibrosis; we examined the relationship between plasma cytokine/chemokine levels and response to treatment with pomalidomide. The study population included 32 Mayo Clinic patients (median age 66 years) who participated in two consecutive clinical trials of pomalidomide therapy for myelofibrosis-associated anemia. Ten (31%) patients achieved anemia response per International Working Group criteria. Anemia response was seen only in the presence of JAK2V617F (P = 0.04) and, in addition, predicted by lower circulating levels of MCP-1 (P = 0.003), IL-2R (P = 0.008), IL-15 (0.01), and IL-8 (P = 0.02). Marked splenomegaly and increased serum LDH level were associated with poor response (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) and with each other (P = 0.02), but not with JAK2V617F. The aforementioned cytokines were not significantly associated with JAK2V617F but increased levels of sIL-2R (P = 0.01), IL-15 (P = 0.06), and MCP-1 (P = 0.07) clustered with marked splenomegaly. Current data suggest that, in the context of pomalidomide treatment, response is more likely in the presence of JAK2V617F and further predicted by the absence of marked splenomegaly or increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

20113293|t|Deferoxamine versus combined therapy for chelating liver, spleen and bone marrow iron in beta-thalassemic patients: a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study.
20113293|a|We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare the effect of iron chelation on liver, spleen and bone marrow. We examined 21 beta-thalassemic patients undergoing deferoxamine (DFO) (9/21) or combined therapy [DFO and deferiprone (L1), 12/21] with two abdominal MRI studies using T1-w/Pd-w/T2*-wGRE and T1-wTSE sequences. Changes in serum ferritin (DF%), and liver, spleen and marrow to paraspinous muscles signal intensity ratios (SI) in T1-wTSE sequence were calculated as D%=[(2(nd)value-1(st) value)/1(st) value] x100%. Negative DF% and positive D(SI)% indicated reduction of iron. Although 17/21 (80.9%) patients demonstrated reduction in ferritin, only 8/21 (38%), 7/21 (33.3%) and 7/21 (33.3%) patients had decreased liver, spleen and marrow iron. Patients undergoing combined therapy showed significantly greater reduction (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) or less increase (t-test, p <0.05) in iron stores. Combined therapy is more effective than DFO for removing and preventing liver, spleen and bone marrow iron accumulation in beta-thalassemic patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is valuable for organ-specific monitoring of chelation therapy.

15085934|t|Total antioxidant levels are low during active TB and rise with anti-tuberculosis therapy.
15085934|a|In tuberculosis, oxidative stress is a result of tissue inflammation, poor dietary intake of micronutrients due to illness, free radical burst from activated macrophages, and anti-tuberculosis drugs. These free radicals may in turn contribute towards pulmonary inflammation if not neutralized by antioxidants. The total antioxidant status (TAS) of individuals is a function of dietary, enzymatic, and other systemic antioxidants and is therefore an indicator of the free radical load. Our aim was to evaluate the TAS of healthy and M. tuberculosis-infected persons from a high TB incidence community, as well as tuberculosis patients at various stages of antituberculosis drug treatment and to correlate results with plasma micronutrient levels. Blood plasma samples from TB infected patients and following antituberculosis drug treatment were assayed for TAS, vitamins A, E and Zinc. Statistical analysis of results was by one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparison post test. Active TB patients showed a significantly lower TAS (P < 0.001) compared to the community controls. We also show that TAS values increase during therapy. Results correlated with micronutrients vitamin A and zinc but vitamin E remained unaffected. We suggest that total antioxidant status of TB patients should be considered for more effective disease control and that diets low in antioxidants may render individuals susceptible to tuberculosis.

21482494|t|Carboplatin and gemcitabine combination in metastatic triple-negative anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated breast cancer patients: a phase II study.
21482494|a|Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of hormone receptors and HER-2 and shares many features with BRCA1-associated cancer. Preclinical data indicate cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that these tumors may have defects in the BRCA1 pathway. The carboplatin and gemcitabine (CG) combination is active in unselected anthracycline/taxane pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, so we carried out a phase II study to evaluate the activity of the CG combination in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients. From 10/2004 to 3/2009 we enrolled 31 patients. Median age was 57 years and 29 patients out of 31 had visceral involvement. The overall response rate (ORR) was 32% (1 complete response /9 partial responses), in addition 5 patients obtained stable disease for >12 weeks. After a median follow-up of 34 months, all patients progressed with a median time to progression of 5.5 months and median overall survival of 11 months. Dose reductions, delays and omissions occurred in 75 (60%), 36 (29%) and 22 (18%) cycles. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 17 and febrile neutropenia in 4 patients. Ten patients had Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Non hematological toxicities were manageable. The CG combination is a reasonable option for the treatment of metastatic pretreated TNBC patients.

22705379|t|Pimaric acid from Aralia cordata has an inhibitory effect on TNF-a-induced MMP-9 production and HASMC migration via down-regulated NF-kB and AP-1.
22705379|a|Many studies have indicated that activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration are involved in neointimal formation and atherosclerosis. In this study, we revealed that pimaric acid (PiMA) purified from Aralia cordata had an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 production and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. Down-regulated MMP-9 mRNA transcription was detected in PiMA-treated cells using RT-PCR and the luciferase-tagged MMP-9 promoter assay. Results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that PiMA-treated HASMCs showed decreased binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and activator protein-1 transcription factors. A Western-blot analysis using nuclear extract demonstrated that PiMA reduced the levels of NF-kB p65, c-Fos, p-c-Jun, Jun-D, and p-ATF2 proteins in the nucleus. In addition, TNF-a stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) containing extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase was inhibited by PiMA. Using the Transwell system, we found that PiMA inhibited TNF-a stimulated HASMC migration/invasion in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm whether MAPK mediated MMP-9 expression, we used MAPK inhibitors including U0126, SB253580, and SP600125 and found that those inhibitors reduced MMP-9 expression and HASMC migration/invasion. These results suggest that PiMA has potent anti-atherosclerotic activity with inhibitory action on MMP-9 production and cell migration in TNF-a-induced HASMCs.

18719021|t|Pharmacological demarcation of the growth hormone, gut motility and feeding effects of ghrelin using a novel ghrelin receptor agonist.
18719021|a|The peptide hormone ghrelin exerts a wide spectrum of activities including the stimulation of GH release, feeding, and gastrointestinal motility, purportedly via the activation of a common receptor, GH secretagogue receptor (since renamed the GRLN-R) The aim of the present study was to determine whether these effects can be separated pharmacologically. Tranzyme Pharma (TZP)-101 is a small-molecule agonist with potent binding affinity (inhibitory constant = 16 nm) and full agonist activity (EC50 = 29 nm, maximum response = 111%) at the human recombinant GRLN-R. Pharmacokinetic profiling of TZP-101 in rat determined a plasma elimination half-life of 99 min and low blood-brain barrier permeability (0.09%). The pharmacological response to TZP-101, administered centrally [intracerebroventricular (icv)] or peripherally (iv), was evaluated in comparison with that of acylated ghrelin. Thus, TZP-101 (iv) accelerated gastric emptying of a liquid meal (2% methylcellulose) similarly to ghrelin (iv). IAlso, TZP-101 (icv) stimulated spontaneous, cumulative food intake in a similar manner to ghrelin (icv). However, unlike ghrelin, TZP-101 did not elicit significant GH release on either central or peripheral administration. Moreover, TZP-101 did not alter ghrelin-induced GH release. n total, these data demonstrate that the GH response can be pharmacologically demarcated from the orexigenic and gastrointestinal responses to ghrelin in rats. The observation that the centrally mediated orexigenic response and the peripherally mediated gastric motility response are pharmacologically associated is consistent with the classification of ghrelin as a brain-gut peptide, whereas the additional action of ghrelin to stimulate GH release (possibly via a distinct signaling pathway) may be considered a complementary mechanism to harmonize somatic growth and body composition with the regulation of energy homeostasis.

19421191|t|Specific adsorption of some complement activation proteins to polysulfone dialysis membranes during hemodialysis.
19421191|a|Dialyser bioincompatibility is an important factor contributing to complications of hemodialysis with well known systemic consequences. Here we studied the local processes that occur on dialysis membranes by eluting proteins adsorbed to the polysulfone dialyser membranes of 5 patients after 3 consecutive routine maintenance hemodialysis sessions. At the end of each procedure, a plasma sample was also collected. These eluates and their accompanying plasma samples were separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis; all proteins that were present in all patients were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry; and a ratio of the relative spot intensity of the eluate to plasma was calculated. Of 153 proteins detected, 84 were found in all patients, 57 of which were successfully identified by mass spectrometry as 38 components of 23 unique proteins. In 10 spots the relative eluate intensity differed significantly from that in the plasma, implying preferential adsorption. These proteins included ficolin-2, clusterin, complement C3c fragment, and apolipoprotein A1. Our finding of a selective binding of ficolin-2 to polysulfone membranes suggests a possible role of the lectin complement pathway in blood-dialyser interactions.

19949756|t|The role of antimicrobial therapy for treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections from community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children.
19949756|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections in skin and soft tissues are increasing in children in Taiwan. This study investigated the outcomes of therapy with or without appropriate antibiotics among children with CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and analyzed the outcomes of management among children with Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive strains and PVL-negative strains. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data for CA-MRSA SSTIs from 107 children younger than 18 years were analyzed. Worsening infection or other surgical therapy were considered treatment failure. Antimicrobial therapy was considered appropriate if it included at least 1 agent to which the organisms showed in vitro susceptibility. RESULTS: The rate of successful treatment was 90.7% (97 episodes). Eighty six children (80.4%) underwent incision and drainage as part of their initial therapy. Four of 5 children (80%) treated with an appropriate antibiotic initially were treated successfully, compared with 93 of 102 children (91.2%) who did not receive an appropriate antibiotic agent (p = 0.394; Fisher's exact test). Treatment failed for 5 of the 39 patients (12.8%) with PVL-positive SSTI CA-MRSA compared with only 1 treatment failure among 11 patients (9.1%) with PVL-negative SSTI CA-MRSA (p = 1.0; Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of successful treatment among children with uncomplicated CA-MRSA SSTIs, even when given inappropriate antibiotic therapy, suggests that treatment of these uncomplicated infections without appropriate antibiotic therapy is possible. Incision and drainage may play an important role in the treatment of uncomplicated SSTIs.

14980950|t|The effect of short-term epidural local anesthetic blockade on urinary levels of substance P in interstitial cystitis.
14980950|a|We investigated the effect of epidural local anesthetic blockade on urinary substance P levels in five patients suffering from painful flare-ups of interstitial cystitis. Urine was collected in 24-h intervals commencing at the onset of an epidural bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine followed by maintenance epidural infusions of 0.05% bupivacaine. Substance P was measured by radioimmunoassay. After initiation of the epidural infusion, urinary substance P levels increased and then declined in all patients. All patients reported a decrease in pain intensity. We hypothesize that acute release, followed by depletion, of substance P from bladder sensory nerve endings accounts for the transient increase of peptide levels in urine and may contribute to the decrease in pain intensity during a 3-day epidural infusion. IMPLICATIONS: Substance P levels in urine initially increased and then declined in a series of 5 patients who achieved pain control by epidural local anesthetic infusion during a flare-up of interstitial cystitis.

11120776|t|Complement receptor 1/CD35 is a receptor for mannan-binding lectin.
11120776|a|Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), a member of the collectin family, is known to have opsonic function, although identification of its cellular receptor has been elusive. Complement C1q, which is homologous to MBL, binds to complement receptor 1 (CR1/CD35), and thus we investigated whether CR1 also functions as the MBL receptor. Radioiodinated MBL bound to recombinant soluble CR1 (sCR1) that had been immobilized on plastic with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 5 nM. N-acetyl-d-glucosamine did not inhibit sCR1-MBL binding, indicating that the carbohydrate binding site of MBL is not involved in binding CR1. C1q inhibited MBL binding to immobilized sCR1, suggesting that MBL and C1q might bind to the same or adjacent sites on CR1. MBL binding to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was associated positively with changes in CR1 expression induced by phorbol myristate acetate. Finally, CR1 mediated the adhesion of human erythrocytes to immobilized MBL and functioned as a phagocytic receptor on PMNs for MBL-immunoglobulin G opsonized bacteria. Thus, MBL binds to both recombinant sCR1 and cellular CR1, which supports the role of CR1 as a cellular receptor for the collectin MBL.

20386089|t|Human prostatic urethra expresses vitamin D receptor and responds to vitamin D receptor ligation.
20386089|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is now considered a determinant of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), promoting, together with the hormonal milieu, prostate overgrowth and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Prostatic urethra actively participates in determining progression of LUTS associated with BPH. AIM: To investigate the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the ability of the VDR agonist elocalcitol to reduce inflammatory responses in human prostatic urethra (hPU) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human prostatic urethra, prostate and bladder neck were obtained from patients affected by BPH. Immunohistochemical studies for VDR expression were performed in tissue samples, from which primary cell cultures were also derived. In hPU cells, proliferation and chemiotaxis were studied, along with Rho kinase (ROCK) activity (MYPT-1 phosphorylation) by western blot. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed for VDR, cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and interleukin (IL)-8 expression. RESULTS: Urethra displays higher VDR expression compared to prostate and bladder neck tissues. The VDR agonist elocalcitol partially reverts COX-2 and IL-8 mRNA upregulation induced by a pro-inflammatory cytokine mixture (IL-17, interferon-y, tumor necrosis factor-a) and inhibits cell migration in urethral cells. Elocalcitol prevents activation of ROCK, as previously demonstrated in bladder and prostate cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prostatic urethra is, within the lower urinary tract, a novel target for VDR agonists, as shown by the capacity of elocalcitol to inhibit ROCK activity and to limit inflammatory responses in human primary urethra cells.

8380135|t|Innovations in multimodality therapy for lung cancer. Combined modality management of limited small-cell lung cancer.
8380135|a|Recent approaches to the treatment of limited small-cell lung cancer have combined local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy in an attempt to improve local control and inhibit distant metastases. Local control is a key indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy administration in combined-modality regimens. However, even in combined-modality trials using high total radiotherapy doses, local failure rates have ranged from 30 to 50 percent. The components of radiotherapy administration--including dose, volume, fractionation, integration with chemotherapy (concurrent, alternating, or sequential), and timing (early or late administration)--are also important considerations. Hyperfractionation, or the administration of small fractions of radiation more than once daily (usually twice), and accelerated hyperfactionation, or the administration of three fourths of the standard radiation dose two to three times daily, have emerged as important concepts in radiotherapy. Although the optimal chemotherapy regimen for combined-modality treatment has not yet been established, use of cisplatin and etoposide combinations, which do not promote pulmonary, cardiac, or esophageal toxicity, have been particularly appropriate in patients with small-cell lung cancer.

15964537|t|HAART with didanosine once versus twice daily: adherence and efficacy.
15964537|a|BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing didanosine taken twice daily was compared with HAART containing didanosine taken once daily in terms of adherence and efficacy. METHOD: This was a self-controlled prospective cohort study, carried out in a tertiary level hospital. A total of 49 HIV-infected patients were included. They were prescribed HAART according to guidelines. After six months taking HAART containing didanosine twice daily, patients continued with the same regimen of HAART although once daily. Thereafter they were followed up for a further nine months. Adherence and virological efficacy were assessed at three-month intervals, for a total of six times, in every patient. RESULTS: Overall, adherence was poor, with only 19 patients (39%) showing adequate adherence for all six visits. Adequate adherence was observed in 29 patients (59%) three months before didanosine switching, and in 37 patients (75%) three months after didanosine switching (P=0.034). Pooled HIV RNA results of the first three visits were higher than the same results of the last three visits (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence is common among patients who take HAART. Simplification of regimens is useful to improve adherence and efficacy.

20181814|t|Effects of coffee consumption on subclinical inflammation and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes: a clinical trial.
20181814|a|BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Suggested mechanisms underlying the association have included attenuation of subclinical inflammation and a reduction in oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of daily coffee consumption on biomarkers of coffee intake, subclinical inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose, and lipid metabolism. DESIGN: Habitual coffee drinkers (n = 47) refrained for 1 mo from coffee drinking; in the second month they consumed 4 cups of filtered coffee/d and in the third month 8 cups of filtered coffee/d (150 mL/cup). Blood samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, bead-based multiplex technology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or immunonephelometry. RESULTS: Coffee consumption led to an increase in coffee-derived compounds, mainly serum caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid metabolites. Significant changes were also observed for serum concentrations of interleukin-18, 8-isoprostane, and adiponectin (medians: -8%, -16%, and 6%, respectively; consumption of 8 compared with 0 cups coffee/d). Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I increased significantly by 12%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, whereas the ratios of LDL to HDL cholesterol and of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I decreased significantly by 8% and 9%, respectively (8 compared with 0 cups coffee/d). No changes were seen for markers of glucose metabolism in an oral-glucose-tolerance test. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption appears to have beneficial effects on subclinical inflammation and HDL cholesterol, whereas no changes in glucose metabolism were found in our study. Furthermore, many coffee-derived methylxanthines and caffeic acid metabolites appear to be useful as biomarkers of coffee intake.

23890963|t|Safety of perioperative aspirin therapy in pancreatic operations.
23890963|a|BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is prevalent among patients presenting for operative treatment of pancreatic disorders. Operative practice has called for the cessation of aspirin 7-10 days before elective procedures because of the perceived increased risk of procedure-related bleeding. Our practice at Thomas Jefferson University has been to continue aspirin therapy throughout the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective pancreatic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Records for patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy between October 2005 and February 2012 were queried for perioperative aspirin use in this institutional research board-approved retrospective study. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,017 patients underwent pancreatic resection, of whom 289 patients (28.4%) were maintained on aspirin through the morning of the operation. Patients in the aspirin group were older than those not taking aspirin (median 69 years vs 62 years, P < .0001). The estimated intraoperative blood loss was similar between the two groups, aspirin versus no aspirin (median 400 mL vs 400 mL, P = .661), as was the rate of blood transfusion anytime during the index admission (29% vs 26%, P = 0.37) and the postoperative duration of hospital stay (median 7 days vs 6 days, P = .103). The aspirin group had a slightly increased rate of cardiovascular complications (10.1% vs 7.0%, P  =  .107), likely reflecting their increased cardiovascular comorbidities that led to their physicians recommending aspirin therapy. Rates of pancreatic fistula (15.1% vs 13.5%, P  =  .490) and hospital readmissions were similar (16.9% vs 14.9%, P  =  .451). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report that aspirin therapy is not associated with increased rates of perioperative bleeding, transfusion requirement, or major procedure related complications after elective pancreatic surgery. These data suggest that continuation of aspirin is safe and that the continuation of aspirin should be considered acceptable and preferable, particularly in patients with perceived substantial medical need for treatment with antiplatelet therapy.

15343134|t|Magnetic resonance with manganese-DPDP (mangafodipir) of focal solid pancreatic lesions.
15343134|a|PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) with Mangafodipir (Mn-DPDP) in the identification of focal solid pancreatic lesions. The possibility of lesion characterisation based on quantification of Mn uptake was also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients (11 females, 23 males, aged 21-75, mean age 57) selected at sonography (US) and spiral CT (SCT) for clinically suspected focal solid pancreatic lesion, were studied between June 2000 and July 2001. Patients eligible for surgery underwent MR imaging (1.5 T) before and after infusion of 5 micromol/kg of Mn-DPDP (0.5 ml/kg Teslascan, Nycomed Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway). The baseline examination included FSE T2-weighted sequences and fat-saturated and non fat-saturated breath-hold gradient-echo T1-weighted sequences (FMP SPGR). After Teslascan infusion, fat-saturated and non fat-saturated FMP SPGR sequences were repeated. Thirty of the 34 patients had a definitive diagnosis provided by reference standards such as post-operative histology (22 cases), cytology (FNAB) and/or a follow-up period of at least 6 months (8 patients). As regards lesion characterisation, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) and contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N ratio) of lesions compared to the pancreatic parenchyma were calculated using ROIs before and after contrast infusion. RESULTS: The definitive diagnosis was pancreatic malignancy in 18 patients, focal pancreatitis in 5 and neuroendocrine tumours in 3. Four patients with suspected lesions at US and/or SCT were free of focal pancreatic disease. Mn-DPDP MR identified 17/18 malignancies, 2/3 endocrine neoplasms 5/5 focal pancreatitis; the 4 patients with no pancreatic lesions were correctly identified. The Mn-DPDP MR accuracy in detecting focal pancreatic solid lesions was 93%. MR missed 1 small adenocarcinoma (the only pT1 in our group) and 1 insulinoma (with Mn uptake similar to the surrounding parenchyma). Due to the small number of inflammatory lesions included in the study, no significant differences were found in signal intensity and Mn-DPDP uptake between focal pancreatitis and neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: MR with Mn-DPDP is very accurate in the identification of focal solid pancreatic lesions. Mangafodi-pir is also very useful for excluding the presence of pancreatic lesions suspected at US or CT. The characterisation of lesions, in particular of inflammatory versus neoplastic lesions, remains problematic and requires further investigation.

16374818|t|Suppression of mitoxantrone cardiotoxicity in multiple sclerosis patients by dexrazoxane.
16374818|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of dexrazoxane to suppress subclinical cardiotoxicity in MS patients receiving mitoxantrone. METHODS: An open-label study was performed to evaluate possible subclinical cardiotoxicity in multiple sclerosis patients treated quarterly with mitoxantrone (48 mg/m(2) cumulative), with and without concomitant dexrazoxane, using blinded serial radionucleide ventriculography. RESULTS: No patient experienced symptoms of heart failure. Patients receiving dexrazoxane, which is cardioprotective for anthracyclines, exhibited a significantly lesser decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (mean change, -3.80% vs -8.55%, p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: These results support a cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane in mitoxantrone treated multiple sclerosis patients.

8202931|t|Comparison of chromosome aberrations and micronuclei in testing genotoxicity in humans.
8202931|a|Chromosome-type aberrations (CsA) and micronuclei (Mn) rates were compared in conventional 2-day lymphocyte cultures. In 67 healthy controls the mean rate of CsA was 0.54%, and that of Mn 2.38/1000 (median 1.66/1000). Mn were significantly correlated with age. The rate of Mn was higher in the 30 individuals with CsA > or = 1% than in the 37 subjects with no CsA. However, in 40 cadmium (Cd) workers, contrary to that found for CsA, the rates of Mn did not differ from those of the controls matched for age and smoking habits, not even in the subgroup with the highest Cd cumulative exposure index, while an age effect was evident both in the exposed and in the controls.

8839230|t|Safety and pharmacologic activity of a new nitrate ester, ITF 296, after intravenous administration in healthy volunteers.
8839230|a|To evaluate the safety and pharmacologic activity of ITF 296 in humans, three groups of healthy male normotensive subjects were studied. The first two groups (six subjects each) received, in ascending order, three dose levels of ITF 296 by 30-min intravenous infusion (group I, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 microgram/kg/min; group II, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 micrograms/kg/min). The third group of eight subjects received, in ascending order, four dose levels of ITF 296 (10, 20, 40, 80 micrograms/kg) by 1-min i.v. injection. The study was double-blind, and placebo-controlled according to a within-patient, incomplete, unbalanced block design, such that each subject received the placebo once. Hemodynamics were assessed by means of Dynamap and BOMED. The following parameters were evaluated at different times before and after ITF 296 administration: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). Blood samples for kinetic assessment of ITF 296 were taken before and at different times after ITF 296 administration. The drug was well tolerated. Only a few mild (except for one, moderate) side effects (mainly headache and dizziness) were reported, usually at the higher dose levels. All safety clinical chemistry and hematologic parameters were unaffected. After i.v. infusion of ITF 296, blood pressure started to fall at the dose of 2 micrograms/kg/min, DBP being significantly reduced at doses above 1 microgram/kg/min. The effect lasted for up to 60 min after the end of the infusion. The increase in heart rate was only modest, although apparently dose-dependent. SVI was only slightly reduced, and the other hemodynamic parameters did not change. After bolus administration of ITF 296, SBP was significantly reduced starting at a dose of 20 micrograms/kg with higher doses producing a more marked effect (up to -15 mm Hg). DBP was significantly reduced only at the higher dose level of 80 micrograms/kg. The effect lasted for up to 60 min after bolus administration. HR was slightly increased after doses of 40 and 80 micrograms/kg. SVI was slightly reduced and a small transient decrease in CI was observed, whereas SVRI did not change. Satisfactory, linear kinetic correlation was found between total doses administered and AUCs measured. ITF 296 in healthy male normotensive volunteers was effective and well tolerated. The results of this study justify the planning of further studies in patients in order to test the anti-ischemic activity of the compound.

24961382|t|Umbilical cord blood acid-base status in pregnancy with congenital heart disease.
24961382|a|BACKGROUND: The risk of fetal and neonatal complications is higher in pregnant women with congenital heart disease (CHD). It remains unknown whether umbilical cord blood gas values are different between pregnant women with CHD and healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section during combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The purpose of the present study was to compare umbilical cord blood acid-base status and gas values in pregnant women with CHD vs. healthy pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section during combined spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia. METHODS: Patients with singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under CSE anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups: healthy pregnant women (group H) and pregnant with congenital heart disease (group CHD). Immediately after delivery, umbilical cord arterial blood sample and venous blood sample were collected and measured. The comparison between two groups was performed using grouped t-test. RESULTS: Forty-four women in group H and 33 women in group CHD were analyzed finally. Umbilical arterial blood pH, base excess (BE) and HCO3 (-) (pH 7.29    ±   0.05, BE -1.4    ±   1.9   mmol/L, HCO3 (-) 21.5    ±   1.4   mmol/L) were significantly lower in pregnant women with CHD than in healthy pregnant women (pH 7.33    ±   0.03, BE -0.1    ±   2.1   mmol/L, HCO3 (-) 22.5    ±   1.4   mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: The lower values of umbilical arterial blood pH, BE and HCO3 (-) were observed in pregnant women with CHD than in healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section during CSE anesthesia.

2201495|t|Fish oil-induced changes in apolipoproteins in IDDM subjects.
2201495|a|The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Max EPA (a commercially available fish oil preparation) on serum cholesterol lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) men with dosages that were likely to be acceptable to patients. Twenty-two male IDDM patients aged 20-41 yr, 6 of whom had retinopathy, were recruited from the Royal Perth Hospital diabetic clinic. After screening, subjects were divided into three groups. Six of the subjects without retinopathy were randomly selected and allocated to a control group. The remaining 16 patients (10 without and 6 with retinopathy) received a fish oil supplement. All subjects were advised to maintain their usual dietary patterns. Sixteen patients, including the 6 with retinopathy, were instructed to take 15 Max EPA fish oil capsules/day with meals. Patients in the control group did not take Max EPA. Three weeks of Max EPA supplementation without other dietary modification led to a significant rise in total cholesterol (P less than 0.01), which could be accounted for by increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The increase in HDL cholesterol was explained by a 33% rise (P less than 0.001) in its HDL2 subclass. Changes in apolipoproteins were examined and showed that the level of apolipoprotein A-I increased after ingestion of fish oil and correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the rise in HDL cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

24846171|t|Tuning of poly-S-nitrosated human serum albumin as superior antitumor nanomedicine.
24846171|a|Macromolecules have been developed as carriers of low-molecular-weight drugs in drug delivery systems (DDS) to improve their pharmacokinetic profile or to promote their uptake in tumor tissue via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. We have previously demonstrated that poly-nitric oxide (NO) conjugated human serum albumin (Poly-SNO-HSA) has the potential to be a DDS carrier capable of accumulating NO in tumors. However, the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA in the circulation has to be improved, and its optimal molecular size for using the EPR effects has to be evaluated. In the present study, we performed two tuning methods for refining Poly-SNO-HSA, namely, pegylation and dimerization. We observed that pegylation enhanced the stability of Poly-SNO-HSA both in vitro and in vivo, and that dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA enhanced the antitumor activity via more efficient delivery of NO in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice. Intriguingly, dimerization resulted in a 10 times higher antitumor activity. These data suggest that pegylation and dimerization of Poly-SNO-HSA are very important tuners to optimize NO stability and accumulation, and thereby effect, in tumors. Thus, polyethylene glycol-Poly-SNO-HSA dimer seems to be a very appealing and safe NO carrier and thereby a strong candidate as an antitumor drug in future development of cancer therapeutics.

7697848|t|Reversal of heparin anticoagulation by recombinant platelet factor 4 in humans.
7697848|a|BACKGROUND: Protamine is used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin, but it can have important side effects. Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a protein found in platelet alpha granules that binds to and thereby neutralizes heparin. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of intravenous recombinant PF4 to neutralize heparin anticoagulation after cardiac catheterization in a phase 1, open-label trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group consisted of 18 patients having diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Heparin (5000 U) was given after vascular access was obtained. In the first 12 patients, additional heparin was given at the conclusion of the procedure so that all patients had activated coagulation times > 300 seconds before rPF4 was given. Three patients each received 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg rPF4 over a period of 3 minutes at the conclusion of the catheterization procedure. In 6 additional patients, extra heparin was not given at the conclusion of the procedure, and 1.0 mg/kg rPF4 was given. Hemodynamic measurements, cardiac output, and serial blood tests were performed 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after rPF4 and then into the next 24 hours. There were no serious side effects in any patient, despite transient rPF4 levels as high as 14,870 ng/mL in the patients receiving 5.0 mg/kg. One patient receiving 2.5 mg/kg had a slight transient rise in liver enzymes possibly related to the rPF4. There were no important hemodynamic effects of rPF4 administration at any dose used. Doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg were uniformly effective in reversing the anticoagulant effect of heparin. At lower doses, rPF4 neutralized the effects of heparin in most but not all patients. Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested a monophasic and one-compartment clearance of the PF4-heparin complex. No neutralizing factors to rPF4 were detected in the samples collected 7 days after dosing. CONCLUSIONS: rPF4, in doses ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg over 3 minutes, had no serious side effects. Given in sufficient amounts, rPF4 can completely and rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin.

18828243|t|JDRF randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in the management of type 1 diabetes: research design and methods.
18828243|a|BACKGROUND: While real-time (RT) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may revolutionize treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D), there is insufficient evidence currently available to support widespread utilization of these devices. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) CGM Study Group developed a randomized clinical trial to determine if RT-CGM can improve glycemic control and quality of life in children and adults with T1D. This paper presents the research design and methods that are being employed in this study. METHODS: The JDRF CGM Study Group trial is a randomized, parallel group, efficacy and safety study. Subjects with T1DM who meet eligibility criteria are randomized to either standard self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) alone or use of any of the three current RT-CGM systems as a supplement to SMBG. After the 6-month randomized period, the Control Group is offered use of RT-CGM, and both groups are studied for an additional 6 months. Subjects are divided into two cohorts: the Main Study Cohort includes subjects with baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0-10.0% inclusive, and the Exploratory Pilot Study Cohort includes subjects with HbA1c<7.0%. Difference in HbA1c is the primary outcome in the Main Study. Other outcomes include the percentage of sensor glucose values within the 70-180 mg/dL range, scores on questionnaires that assess the impact of RT-CGM on living with T1D, and the cost-effectiveness of RT-CGM. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study was completed on December 15, 2007. CONCLUSION: Results of this clinical trial should help establish whether or not current RT-CGM devices are beneficial to patients with T1D.

22301466|t|Interleukin 28B genetic polymorphisms and viral factors help identify HCV genotype-1 patients who benefit from 24-week pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy.
22301466|a|BACKGROUND: Interleukin 28B (IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and viral factors can predict sustained virological response (SVR) in HCV genotype-1 (HCV-1) patients receiving 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Whether these factors would identify those patients who can benefit from a shorter duration of therapy remains unclear. METHODS: Treatment-naive HCV-1 patients (n=662) receiving 24 or 48 weeks of combination therapy were enrolled. Baseline demographic data, HCV viral load, IL28B SNP genotypes (rs8099917), duration of therapy and rapid virological response (RVR) were evaluated to predict SVR. The SVR rates were further stratified by the independent factors and compared. RESULTS: The IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, low baseline viral load (HCV RNA <=600,000 IU/ml), RVR and 48-week therapy independently predicted SVR. In RVR patients with the IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, the SVR rate of 24-week therapy was comparable to 48-week therapy (95% versus 99%; P=0.21) at low baseline viral load, but was inferior to 48-week therapy (70% versus 97%; P<0.001) at high baseline viral load. In non-RVR patients, the SVR rate of 24-week therapy was inferior to 48-week therapy for those with the IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype but high baseline viral load (23% versus 62%; P<0.001), and those with the IL28B rs8099917 GT/GG genotype but low baseline viral load (0% versus 33%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: HCV-1 patients simultaneously bearing the IL28B rs8099917 TT genotype, low baseline viral load and RVR can benefit from a shorter duration of combination therapy.

15632879|t|Role of central sympathoexcitation in enhanced hypercapnic chemosensitivity in patients with heart failure.
15632879|a|BACKGROUND: Enhanced central hypercapnic chemosensitivity is known to mediate excessive exercise ventilation and to indicate a poor prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. The present study was designed to elucidate the role of central sympathetic activity in the enhancement of hypercapnic chemosensitivity. METHODS: Central hypercapnic chemosensitivity and plasma norepinephrine were measured in 99 patients with chronic heart failure. In 40 patients, the alpha index was derived from simultaneous analysis of R-R interval and systolic blood pressure variability. The effects of a central sympatholytic agent, guanfacine (0.25 mg/day), on hypercapnic chemosensitivity and exercise ventilatory response were studied in 20 of these patients. RESULTS: Hypercapnic chemosensitivity was enhanced in 76% of the patients and correlated significantly with plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.49, P < .01) at rest. There was a significant inverse relationship between central chemosensitivity and the alpha index (r = -0.41, P < .01). Guanfacine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine levels by 29% (P < .01) and chemosensitivity by 31% (P < .01). The beneficial effect of central sympathoinhibition with guanfacine was observed specifically in patients who had enhanced chemosensitivity prior to drug administration. Similarly, the patients with excessive exercise ventilation showed a greater reduction in exercise ventilation with this agent. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that central sympathoexcitation could play an important role in the pathogenesis of enhanced hypercapnic chemosensitivity and a resultant increase in exercise ventilation in chronic heart failure.

22999793|t|Free carnitine and acylcarnitines in  obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and effects of  pioglitazone treatment.
22999793|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine fasting and insulin-stimulated levels of carnitine precursors, total and free carnitine, and acylcarnitines, and evaluate the impact of pioglitazone treatment in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: The present study is a secondary analysis of a previously published case-control study, followed by a double-blind randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Academic tertiary care medical center. PATIENT(S): Thirty obese premenopausal patients with PCOS and 14 healthy women. INTERVENTION(S): Sixteen weeks of blinded treatment with pioglitazone (30 mg/d) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Total and free carnitine and acylcarnitines. RESULT(S): Contrary to controls, patients with PCOS were characterized with slightly lower levels of fasting total and free carnitine, its precursors, and derivatives. Total and free carnitine correlated inversely to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in patients with PCOS, whereas no associations were found between acylcarnitines and androgenes. Insulin stimulation-induced changes in the levels of total and free carnitine, carnitine precursors, and acylcarnitines in the PCOS group followed the same trends as in the control group. Pioglitazone treatment significantly increased fasting levels of serum-free carnitine, propionyl carnitine, and total carnitine. The analysis of between group differences revealed significant changes in the isovaleryl carnitine levels and lipid oxidation rates after pioglitazone treatment compared with placebo. CONCLUSION(S): Acute insulin stimulation was associated with increased serum levels of free carnitine in both patients and healthy controls. Treatment with pioglitazone is able to redistribute free fatty acids from insulin-sensitive tissues, diminish demand for carnitine, and influence the overall carnitine turnover. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00145340.

17457047|t|ErbB3 expression and dimerization with EGFR influence pancreatic cancer cell sensitivity to erlotinib.
17457047|a|Abnormal expression and signaling of ErbB receptors has been implicated in multiple epithelial malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has been recently approved for pancreatic cancer treatment, but there are no reliable predictors of patient response. Expression of additional ErbB receptors seems to influence tumor response to EGFR-targeted therapy. We analyzed the influence of ErbB3 expression on pancreatic cancer cell response to erlotinib treatment. Proliferation assays of five human pancreatic cancer cell lines were performed following treatment with erlotinib. Expression and phosphorylation profiles of ErbB receptors and downstream adaptor protein (Akt, ERK1/2, STAT3, mTOR) were evaluated following stimulation with EGF or neuregulin-beta. The formation of EGFR homodimers and EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers, necessary to enable ErbB3 downstream signaling, was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking assays. The effects of RNA inhibition of ErbB3 on sensitivity to erlotinib treatment were evaluated in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. Erlotinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation and proliferation of all the ErbB3-expressing cell lines but did not affect mTOR activation. Cross-linking studies confirmed the presence of EGFR-ErbB3 heterodimers in pancreatic cancer cells. Only the ErbB3-deficient MIA PaCa-2 cells displayed persistent Akt activation and ongoing proliferation in spite of erlotinib treatment. siRNA-mediated inhibition of ErbB3 expression in AsPC-1 cells resulted in acquired resistance to erlotinib treatment. Pancreatic cancer cells which lack ErbB3 do not display activation of the ErbB3-PI3K-Akt cascade induced by EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimers and become less critically dependent on EGFR signaling and therefore resistant to erlotinib. Pancreatic cancer expression of ErbB3 may be useful for EGFR-targeted therapy patient selection.

8337887|t|Effect of peritoneal fluid pH on outcome of aminoglycoside treatment of intraabdominal infections.
8337887|a|Netilmicin and clindamycin were administered to 47 patients with an intraabdominal infection who underwent emergency laparotomy. Thirty-one patients were cured, seven were improved, and therapy failed in nine patients despite the fact that all aerobic bacteria isolated from these patients were sensitive to netilmicin as determined by standard in vitro susceptibility tests. The pH of peritoneal and drainage fluid collected intraoperatively and during follow-up correlated with clinical outcome. Acidic pH was found in 21 of 33 (64%) specimens sampled from patients with therapeutic failure compared to 17 of 80 (21%) obtained from the categories "cured" and "improved" (p < 0.001). Netilmicin concentrations in serum or peritoneal/drainage fluid did not correlate with clinical outcome. Netilmicin levels were above the minimal inhibitory concentration of the pathogens in 59 of 64 (92%) drainage fluid specimens in which aerobic bacteria were isolated. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 91% of drainage fluid specimens if the pH was less than 7.0, compared to 37% if pH was more than 7.0 (p < 0.001). Reduction of pH antagonized aminoglycoside activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. Surgical reexploration should be considered in cases of deterioration following a laparotomy associated with detection of acidic drainage fluid.

19263182|t|Intravenous lidocaine for fibromyalgia syndrome: an open trial.
19263182|a|Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain. In this study, we investigated the effect of intravenous infusions of lidocaine in pain and quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia. Twenty-three consecutive patients were included in the study, which consisted on five sequential intravenous 2% lidocaine infusions with rising dosages (2-5 mg/kg, days 1-5). Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were applied before the first lidocaine infusion, immediately after the fifth infusion and 30 days after the fifth infusion. A significant improvement was observed in the FIQ scores after the fifth infusion (73.52 +/- 16.56 vs 63.29 +/- 21.21, p = 0.02), which was maintained after 30 days (73.52 +/- 16.56 vs 63.85 +/- 24.59, p = 0.04). Similar results were seen concerning the VAS: 8.19 +/- 1.76 vs 6.84 +/- 2.44, p = 0.01 and 8.19 +/- 1.76 vs 7.17 +/- 2.35, p = 0.05, respectively. Intravenous lidocaine infusions are safe and effective in the management of fibromyalgia.

10808171|t|Risk of cataract among users of intranasal corticosteroids.
10808171|a|BACKGROUND: Oral corticosteroid users are at increased risk of cataract, but the risk among intranasal corticosteroids users is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the risk of cataract among users of intranasal steroids. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study of cataract incidence was conducted among users of oral and intranasal steroids identified from the United Kingdom-based General Practice Research Database with a nested case-control analysis to control for confounding factors. The study population included 286,078 subjects aged less than 70 years old drawn from 350 general practices in England and Wales. Patients were classified as users of only intranasal corticosteroids, users of only oral corticosteroids, and nonusers of either medication. Computerized medical records were used to identify cases of cataract. Two hundred twenty-five cases were randomly selected for validation against general practitioners' held referral and hospitalization letters. RESULTS: The incidence rate of cataract (1.0/1000 person-years) among users of intranasal corticosteroids was similar to the incidence rate among nonusers. However, oral corticosteroid users were at higher risk of cataract (2.2/1000 person-years). Approximately 70% of intranasal corticosteroid exposure was to beclomethasone dipropionate only; the event rate in this group was similar to that in the unexposed group. Cataract risk did not increase with the number of prior prescriptions for intranasal corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: The use of intranasal corticosteroids was not associated with an increased risk of cataracts in this study population.

8949443|t|Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid in the treatment of actinic cheilitis.
8949443|a|Three patients with cheilitis were successfully treated by photodynamic therapy using the topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), followed by irradiation with incoherent visible light. The three patients had had, for several years, disabling lesions on the lower lip, and histopathological examination showed dysplastic lesions without signs of carcinoma. Conventional treatments were ineffective. During photodynamic therapy, all patients reported a burning sensation when irradiated at the ALA treated area, diminishing immediately after removal of the light source, and vanishing within 4 days after treatment. Superficial peeling began 4 days after treatment, and lasted some months. Follow-up, after 6 and 12 months, did not reveal any sign of recurrence.

21031168|t|The rise and fall of Dimebon.
21031168|a|Dimebon (latrepirdine) was developed and used in Russia as an over-the-counter oral antihistamine for allergy treatment. In the early 1990s, Dimebon was characterized as a low-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist by Dr. Sergey Bachurin and his colleagues. An initial small-scale, open-label trial of Dimebon in 14 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients demonstrated potential efficacy. Dimebon was then patented for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and licensed by Medivation. Extremely promising results were obtained in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II AD trial in 183 patients; however, a phase II trial of Dimebon in 91 Huntington's disease patients was much less successful. Recently, a phase III AD trial of Dimebon in 598 patients failed to result in any significant improvement in primary or secondary outcomes. The failure of Dimebon may be in large part due to insufficient understanding of its mechanism of action. The NMDA receptor blocking activity of Dimebon is too weak to be physiologically relevant, while the proposed "novel mitochondrial mechanism of action" lacks credible scientific evidence or a molecular target. Independent studies indicate that the clinical effects of Dimebon most likely result from inhibition of histamine H  and serotonin 5-HT  receptors. Careful preclinical studies of novel potential therapies are needed to minimize chances of making similar costly mistakes in the future.

20963534|t|How to treat a tibial post fracture in total knee arthroplasty? A systematic review.
20963534|a|BACKGROUND: Posterior-stabilized TKAs, which use a polyethylene tibial post to articulate against a metal femoral cam, are used regularly. Reported complications are related to the patellofemoral articulation or the tibial post-cam mechanism. Fracture of the tibial post is an uncommon but disabling complication after posterior-stabilized TKA that requires operative treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The literature was reviewed to determine the frequency of tibial post fracture and address three questions: (1) Is there a specific prosthetic design or patient demographics in knees with a fracture of the tibial post? (2) What are the common presenting complaints and methods of diagnosis? (3) What methods of treatment have been used? METHODS: A PubMed search of English language articles from February 1982 to April 2010 was performed and 20 articles, all Level IV studies, were identified. RESULTS: One specific design of posterior-stabilized tibial post with a central screw hole had a 12.4% incidence of fracture. Tibial post fracture has been reported with other designs, but with an incidence of 1% or less. The most common presenting symptoms include effusion, instability, or patella clunk syndrome. The most common method of diagnosis was clinical examination followed by arthroscopic examination. Treatment with revision to a new tibial polyethylene liner generally has been successful at short-term followup. CONCLUSIONS: Tibial post fracture is a relatively uncommon complication after posterior-stabilized TKA that usually is treated successfully with liner exchange. The low quality of available literature makes it difficult to recommend a specific treatment protocol.

16981847|t|Genetics of antipsychotic treatment emergent weight gain in schizophrenia.
16981847|a|Classic and modern antipsychotics can induce substantial weight gain causing diabetes, lipid abnormalities and psychological distress. Treatment emergent weight gain varies within the broad class of antipsychotics; however, an individual's propensity to develop weight gain largely depends on genetic factors. The first part of this review highlights current ideas and concepts related to antipsychotic-induced weight gain, including principles on energy homeostasis. The second part summarizes genetic findings emphasizing studies published after 2003 as prior studies have been reviewed in detail elsewhere. Candidate gene studies have produced significant findings in the 5-hydroxytryptamin 2C (5HT2C) and adrenergic alpha2a (ADRalpha2a) receptor genes, as well as in the leptin, guanine nucleotide binding protein (GNB3) and synaptomal-associated protein 25kDa (SNAP25) genes. Results from genome-wide association and linkage studies point to several chromosomal regions (e.g., 12q24) and some specific genes (e.g., promelanin concentrating hormone [PMCH], polycyctic kidney and hepatic disease 1 [PKHD1], peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase [PAM]). However, more efforts are needed before risk prediction and personalized medicine can be made available for antipsychotic-induced weight gain.

16177570|t|Biomarkers to predict response to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.
16177570|a|Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are amplified and overexpressed in many different human cancers, a phenomenon generally associated with poor prognosis. Inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity associated with this receptor have been approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-refractory nonsmall cell lung cancer, and are in clinical trials for additional tumor types. While these inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, display limited response rates when assessed in cohorts that include all patients, there are subgroups, defined by patient and tumor characteristics, that preferentially respond to these agents. We recently performed an analysis of tumors obtained from a Phase I trial of erlotinib in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. We showed that patients whose tumors exhibited overexpression and amplification of EGFR responded better than patients who had normal levels of this gene and protein. We also demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of PKB/Akt was an important determinant for response, with low phospho-PKB/Akt levels predicting good response to erlotinib. We discuss these findings in the context of recent molecular analyses of the placebo-controlled Phase III trials that led to approval of EGFR inhibitors. These data underscore the importance of placebo-controlled trials to distinguish between prognostic indicators of disease progression more generally and predictive markers of response to therapy. Ultimately the goal of these studies is to allow selection of patients who will preferentially respond to EGFR inhibitors.

16461424|t|Using plasma topotecan pharmacokinetics to estimate topotecan exposure in cerebrospinal fluid of children with medulloblastoma.
16461424|a|The purpose of this study was to estimate ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) topotecan lactone (TPT) exposures in pediatric medulloblastoma patients from plasma concentration-time data by using a pharmacokinetic (PK) model. We studied children with high-risk medulloblastoma who received pharmacokinetically guided TPT (target plasma area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], 120-160 ng/ml-h) and obtained serial vCSF samples to assess TPT exposure. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by using linear mixed-effects modeling via the two-stage approach. We simulated TPT vCSF exposure duration at plasma TPT AUC values of 120 to 200 ng/ml-h and determined percentages of studies meeting or exceeding the vCSF exposure duration threshold (EDT) of 1 ng/ml for 8 h. We then used bootstrap methods to estimate variability in vCSF EDT. Eighteen PK studies were conducted in six patients (median age, 4.8 years). In these patients, seven of nine studies attaining target plasma TPT AUC achieved the vCSF EDT. Given a plasma TPT AUC of 120 ng/ml-h, the median percentage of results meeting or exceeding EDT was 78% (95% CI, 61%-100%). One patient (four studies) with tumor blockage of CSF flow, which can alter CSF pharmacokinetics, was removed, and the bootstrap analysis was repeated. In this subset, a median 93% (95% CI, 79%-100%) of studies achieved vCSF EDT. Increasing plasma TPT AUC values resulted in increased ability to achieve vCSF EDT. We demonstrated that a plasma PK model could estimate vCSF TPT concentrations. Further, our results indicate that the TPT vCSF EDT can be achieved in more than 80% of studies targeted to a plasma TPT AUC of 120 ng/ml-h.

9701102|t|Cost-effectiveness of therapies for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
9701102|a|BACKGROUND: The most appropriate treatment(s) for patients with atrial fibrillation remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of anti-thrombotic and antiarrhythmic treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We performed decision and cost-effectiveness analyses using a Markov state transition model. We gathered data from the English-language literature using MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles. We obtained financial data from nationwide physician-fee references, a medical center's cost accounting system, and one of New England's larger managed care organizations. We examined strategies that included combinations of cardioversion, antiarrhythmic therapy with quinidine, sotalol hydrochloride, or amiodarone, and anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS: For a 65-year-old man with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, any intervention results in a significant gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with no specific therapy. Use of aspirin results in the largest incremental gain (1.2 QALYs). Cardioversion followed by the use of amiodarone and warfarin together is the most effective strategy, yielding a gain of 2.3 QALYs compared with no specific therapy. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratios of cardioversion followed by aspirin, with or without amiodarone, are $33800 per QALY and $10800 per QALY, respectively. Cardioversion followed by amiodarone and warfarin has a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $92400 per QALY compared with amiodarone and aspirin. Strategies that include cardioversion followed by either quinidine or sotalol are both more expensive and less effective than competing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Cardioversion of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation followed by the use of aspirin alone or with amiodarone has a reasonable marginal cost-effectiveness ratio. While cardioversion followed by the use of amiodarone and warfarin results in the greatest gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy, it is expensive (ie, has a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio) compared with aspirin and amiodarone. Finally, for patients who are bothered little by symptoms of atrial fibrillation, cardioversion followed by either aspirin or warfarin without subsequent antiarrhythmic therapy is the treatment of choice.

24676047|t|Systematic review of N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of addictions.
24676047|a|OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first systematic literature review of clinical trials of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the treatment of substance abuse disorders and addictive behaviors. METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO databases was conducted. The inclusion criteria for the review were clinical trials that used NAC in the treatment of a disorder related to substance use and/or addictive behaviors, limited to texts in English, Spanish, or French. The selected studies were evaluated with respect to type of trial, sample size, diagnostic input, intervention, length of follow-up, outcome variables, and results. RESULTS: Nine studies analyzing a total of 165 patients met the eligibility criteria and were included in qualitative analysis. These studies evaluated the role of NAC in cocaine dependence (three studies), cannabis dependence (two studies), nicotine dependence (two studies), methamphetamine addiction (one study), and pathological gambling (one study). Five of these trials were double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled. CONCLUSIONS: The studies analyzed suggest a potential role for NAC in the treatment of addiction, especially of cocaine and cannabis dependence. These results are concordant with the hypothesis of the involvement of glutamatergic pathways in the pathophysiology of addiction.

20419369|t|Influence of oral contraceptives on endogenous pain control in healthy women.
20419369|a|This study investigated the influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) in healthy women. Fifteen women taking OC and 17 normally menstruating women (No-OC) were tested during high and low endogenous estrogens sessions. Saliva was sampled for analysis of endogenous estradiol level. Mechanical pressure (test stimuli) was applied to the masseter muscle and finger. The pain induced by this pressure was assessed on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) before, during, and after immersion of the contralateral hand in ice-cold water (cold pressor test, CPT) to induce DNIC. For all subjects, pain induced by the test stimuli decreased significantly during the CPT (P < 0.001). The decrease in general was larger in the No-OC group, with a significant difference between groups in the masseter muscle in the low session (P < 0.027). There were no significant differences between groups or sessions in estradiol levels. These results indicate that endogenous pain modulation may be less effective in OC users.

11741727|t|A simple cell line based in vitro test system for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligands.
11741727|a|The generation of cell lines stably expressing the functional recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NRs) and their use for ligand testing in a simple excitotoxicity model is described. The mouse fibroblast cell line L(tk-) was co-transfected stably with cDNAs encoding the human NR subunits, NR1-1a/NR2A or NR1-1a/NR2B, respectively. The NR expression and functionality in resulting clones have been verified by RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and fluo-4 calcium imaging. Stimulation of NR expressing clones with L-glutamate and glycine resulted in necrosis of cultures within 1 h. Therefore, a lactate dehydrogenase-based excitotoxicity assay was used for the pharmacological characterisation. The two selected clones exhibited pharmacological properties corresponding to the distinct NR subunit assemblies. Both cell lines showed proton inhibition of cell death in the range of physiological pH. EC50-values for L-glutamate under saturated D-serine concentrations were 3.7 microM for L12-G10 (NR1-1a/NR2A) and 2.8 microM for L13-E6 (NR1-1a/NR2B), respectively. Competitive antagonists (RS)-APV and (RS)-CPP as well as glycine B site antagonist DCKA prevented L-glutamate/glycine-induced cell death. NR2B selective antagonists such as ifenprodil or haloperidol did only protect L13-E6 cells. Spermine (300 microM) triggered cell death selectively in the L13-E6 clone in a pH-dependent manner.

12028402|t|Autoimmune cholangiopathy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
12028402|a|We report a 39-year-old female who presented over 11 years with autoimmune cholangiopathy associated with kaleidoscopic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including, arthritis, skin changes, pleuritis, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hyperglobulinemia, and major depression. While antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) were absent, antinuclear (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies were detected in high titres associated with hypocomplementemia. The patient also had vitamin B12 deficiency and antiphospholipid antibodies. The patient required steroids and repeated courses of cyclophosphamide for the management of lupus nephritis, and ursodeoxycholic acid (ursolite) administration resulted in amelioration of cholestatic laboratory abnormalities. This unusual case report and review of literature illustrate that immune liver disease may be an important clinical manifestation of SLE, especially autoimmune cholangiopathy.

17685738|t|Outcome following clozapine discontinuation: a retrospective analysis.
17685738|a|BACKGROUND: Clozapine is uniquely effective in refractory schizophrenia, but treatment attrition is high. There has been minimal formal study of the outcomes of stopping clozapine, beyond published observations of the time period immediately after cessation. Our aim was to establish medium-term outcome in patients stopping clozapine in normal clinical practice. METHOD: This study was a retrospective analysis of all subjects registered with Clozaril Patient Monitoring Service and treated in South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Trust who stopped clozapine between March 2002 and March 2005 after at least 1 year's treatment. Case note review was performed to determine relevant information for 1 year before and 1 year after discontinuation of clozapine, including subject details, reasons for stopping, and clinical outcome 1 year after discontinuation. The primary outcome measure was the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Twelve had died while receiving clozapine. Of those followed up for 1 year after cessation (N = 23), mean Global Assessment of Functioning scores fell by 15 points (95% CI = 6.6 to 24.3; p = .002). Days spent in hospital rose from a mean of 74.1 (SD = 137.3) to 119.8 (SD = 143.5) (p = .214). CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of clozapine has a marked negative impact on clinical status. Death is a common cause of clozapine cessation.

16043013|t|Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in delirious cancer patients: an open-label trial.
16043013|a|Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl. Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium (the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, MDAS), pain, and other symptoms (categorical verbal scale from 0: none to 3: severe) and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS) (from 0: none to 4: extreme); and performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), and the median increase in total opioid dose was 42%. Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and pain score of 2 or less, was obtained in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001); from 2.6 (Day 0) to 1.6 and 1.3 on the STAS (Days 3 and 7, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptom scores of dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting significantly decreased, and performance status significantly improved. Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl may be effective in alleviating delirium and pain in cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium.

23192383|t|Combined effects of direct current stimulation and immobilized BMP-2 for enhancement of osteogenesis.
23192383|a|Direct current (DC) stimulation has been used to promote bone repair and osteogenesis, but problems associated with the implanted metal electrodes may limit its application and compromise the therapeutic results. The replacement of the metal electrodes with a biodegradable conductive polymer film can potentially overcome these problems. In our work, polypyrrole/chitosan films comprising polypyrrole nanoparticles dispersed in a chitosan matrix were prepared. The polypyrrole/chitosan film meets the requirements for DC delivery, as indicated by its electrical conductivity, biodegradability, and mechanical properties. The film supports osteoblast growth to the same degree as dentine discs (a bone-like mineralized substrate), confirming that it is non-cytotoxic. Our results showed that optimal DC stimulation was achieved with 200  µA for 4 h per day, and under this condition, osteoblast metabolic activity on Day 7 increased by 1.8-fold over that without DC stimulation. To further improve osteogenesis on the polypyrrole/chitosan film, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was covalently immobilized on the film surface. Osteoblasts cultured on the BMP-2-functionalized polypyrrole/chitosan film and subjected to the optimal DC stimulation exhibited a significant increase in cellular metabolic activity (2.3-fold on Day 7), ALP activity (1.7-fold on Day 21) and mineralization (twofold on Day 21) over those cultured on polypyrrole/chitosan film without DC stimulation. Osteogenic gene expression results showed that BMP-2 and DC stimulation by itself enhanced osteoblast differentiation, and a combination of these two factors resulted in synergistic effects on osteoblast differentiation and maturation.

24529939|t|Safety and length of benefit of restylane for office-based injection medialization-a retrospective review of one institution's experience.
24529939|a|OBJECTS: Restylane is a relatively new material being used for temporary vocal fold medialization. Few studies have evaluated the safety, complication rate, and length of benefit derived from Restylane injection medialization. We report on 64 patients who underwent office-based injection medialization with Restylane to establish the safety of and length of benefit from this material. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients who underwent office-based injection medialization with Restylane during a 2-year period was performed. RESULTS: Eighty-two injections in 64 patients were reviewed. Five total adverse events occurred (3.88%). The average length of benefit from injection medialization with Restylane was 12.2  weeks. No inflammatory or hypersensitivity reactions to Restylane occurred. A trend toward avoidance of permanent medialization was observed in patients injected <6  months from time of injury compared with patients injected >6  months after (P  =  0.0511). CONCLUSION: Restylane is a safe and effective temporary material for office-based injection medialization with an average length of benefit of 12.2  weeks. This represents the largest series to date using Restylane and no hypersensitivity or granulomatous reactions were observed. Our data showed a trend toward avoidance of permanent medialization in patients who were injected <6  months after nerve injury, which supports the findings of others.

10971303|t|Steady-state pharmacokinetics of lithium in healthy volunteers receiving concomitant meloxicam.
10971303|a|AIMS: This open, controlled study investigated the effect of concomitant 15 mg oral meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of lithium in healthy male volunteers. METHODS: On days 1-14 lithium was coadministered with meloxicam to 16 volunteers; on days 10-14 lithium was administered in individualized dosage regimes to achieve stable lithium plasma concentrations in the lower therapeutic range of 0.3-0.7 mmol l(-1). A 12 h steady-state concentration profile for lithium was obtained at day 14, after which meloxicam was withdrawn. The lithium dose remained unchanged from day 15 to day 22, at which time a second lithium concentration profile was determined. RESULTS: Lithium and meloxicam were well tolerated throughout the study and all 16 volunteers completed the study. Lithium predose concentrations (Cpre,ss) and area under the curve (AUCss) values both increased by 21% (paired t-test P = 0.0002; 90% confidence intervals for test/reference ratios: 113-130% and 115-128%, respectively) when lithium was coadministered with meloxicam compared with values obtained for lithium alone. The geometric mean lithium Cpre,ss was 0.65 mmol l(-1) when coadministered with meloxicam and 0.54 mmol l(-1) for lithium alone. Lithium Cmax,ss values were increased by 16% by coadministration of meloxicam, from 0.97 mmol l(-1) to 1.12 mmol l(-1). The total plasma clearance of lithium was lower with concomitant meloxicam administration (82.5% of value for lithium alone). CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam (15 mg) moderately increased the plasma concentration of lithium in healthy volunteers, but by a magnitude thought to be of low clinical relevance. Nevertheless, lithium plasma concentrations should be closely monitored in patients receiving concomitant meloxicam and lithium therapy.

7533902|t|Human fibroblast growth factor 1 gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells is modulated via an alternate promoter in response to serum and phorbol ester.
7533902|a|We have previously isolated the human FGF-1 gene in order to elucidate the molecular basis of its gene expression. The gene spans over 100 kbp and encodes multiple transcripts expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. Two variants of FGF-1 mRNA (designated FGF-1.A and 1.B), which differ in their 5' untranslated region, were identified in our laboratory. Recently, two novel variants of FGF-1 mRNA (designated FGF-1.C and 1.D) have been isolated. In this study we used RNase protection assays to demonstrate expression of FGF-1.D mRNA in human fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells and to show that promoter 1D has multiple transcription start sites. A single-strand nuclease-sensitive region has also been identified in the promoter 1D region that may have implications in chromatin conformation and transcriptional regulation of this promoter. Using Northern blot hybridization analyses, a previous study demonstrated a significant increase of FGF-1 mRNA levels in cultured saphenous vein smooth muscle cells in response to serum and phorbol ester. Here we confirm these results by RNase protection analysis and show that FGF-1.C mRNA is significantly increased in response to these stimuli. RNase protection assays indicate that promoter 1C has one major start site. The phorbol ester effect suggests that a protein kinase C-dependent signalling pathway may be involved in this phenomenon. Our results point to a dual promoter usage of the FGF-1 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, normal growing cells primarily utilize promoter 1D. In contrast, quiescent cells, when exposed to serum or phorbol ester, utilize a different FGF-1 promoter, namely promoter 1C. Overall, these phenomena suggest mechanisms for increased production of FGF-1 that may play a role in inflammatory settings, wound healing, tissue repair, and neovascularization events and processes via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings suggest that different FGF-1 promoters may respond to different physiological conditions and stimuli, in reference to the cell type or tissue milieu, resulting in ultimate production of the FGF-1 protein.

24931115|t|Simultaneous determination of citrulline and arginine in human blood plasma by capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet absorption detection.
24931115|a|A new capillary electrophoresis method to measure human blood plasma arginine and citrulline levels in a single run without derivatization was established. After adding homoarginine as internal standard, plasma proteins were removed by a 90:10 v/v acetonitrile/ammonia mixture. Arginine and citrulline were detected by an ultraviolet detector at 190 nm and separated in 11.65 and 20.43 min, respectively, by using a 75 mmol/L Tris phosphate solution at pH 1.2 as a background electrolyte. Limits of detection were 0.8 and 5 µmol/L for arginine and citrulline, respectively. Precision tests indicated a good repeatability of migration times and of peak area both for citrulline (CV% = 0.82 and 3.19) and arginine (CV% = 0.65 and 2.79). The CV% for intra- and interassay tests were, respectively, 1.84 and 3.23 for citrulline and 1.25 and 1.50 for arginine. Mean recovery was 101.5 and 98.5% for citrulline and arginine, respectively. The performance of the developed method was assessed by measuring plasma arginine levels in 52 subjects and the data were compared with those obtained by our previous assay. The new method was then applied to assess plasma citrulline and arginine in ten chronic kidney disease patients under hypolipidemic therapy with statin.

2390269|t|Generation of human LAK cells in tissue culture bags using recombinant IL-2 and serum free medium. Effects of pretreatment with phenylalanine-methylester.
2390269|a|A technique for processing and culturing of human LAK cells using an automated closed system and tissue culture bags is described. To circumvent the inhibitory effects of monocytes on LAK cells the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were pretreated with phenylalanine-methylester (PheOMe). PBMC were obtained from healthy donors by leukapheresis of whole blood. After pretreatment with PheOMe and culturing with IL-2 for 96 h, 60% of the cells remained. PheOMe significantly reduced the number of monocytes (Leu-M3+ cells) from 20-12%. The lytic activity (against K562 and Daudi) of non-PheOMe-treated cells reached a plateau at 72-96 h while PheOMe-treated cells reached maximum activity at 96 h. The total lytic activity/tissue culture bag at 96 h of PheOMe-pretreated cells was significantly augmented in comparison to non-PheOMe-pretreated cells. The present technique allows rapid and simple generation of LAK cells without serum in sterile receptacles suitable for therapy. Additionally, the LAK cell efficacy was improved by reducing the inhibitory effects of monocytes.

15105299|t|Strain-dependent differences in malignant conversion of mouse skin tumors is an inherent property of the epidermal keratinocyte.
15105299|a|The multistage evolution of squamous skin tumors induced by chemical or viral carcinogens on mice from different genetic backgrounds has been a valuable model to define low penetrance loci that determine cancer susceptibility or resistance. Susceptibility determinants are multigenic, stage-specific, dependent on the carcinogenesis protocol, and in the case of initiating events, intrinsic properties of keratinocytes. In this study we examined the malignant conversion frequency of keratinocytes derived from FVB/N, inbred SENCARA/Pt, BALB/c or C57BL/6 mouse strains that differ substantially in the frequency of progression from papilloma to carcinoma. Keratinocytes were cultured from newborn mice and tested in an in vitro malignant conversion assay induced by a chemical carcinogen or immortalized by infection with replication defective human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6/E7 retroviruses and tested for malignancy by grafting immortalized cell lines to nude mice. In vitro, FVB/N keratinocytes were 10-fold more sensitive to chemically induced malignant conversion than keratinocytes from other strains, consistent with the known sensitivity of this strain to pre-malignant progression in vivo. The E6/E7 genes induced immortalization of keratinocytes from FVB/N, SENCARA/Pt or C57BL/6 mice more efficiently than BALB/c, and HPV-16-immortalized FVB/N keratinocytes formed tumors more frequently (64%) than SENCARA/Pt (31%) BALB/c (1.9%) or C57BL/6 (2.5%). Furthermore, 78% of the tumors formed by FVB/N keratinocytes progressed to squamous carcinomas compared with 46% for SENCARA/Pt-derived cells and <3% for the others. In F(1) offspring of crosses from SENCARA/Pt and FVB/N mice, both the papilloma incidence and frequency of malignant conversion reflected the SENCARA/Pt parent indicating that predisposition to pre-malignant progression is not a dominant characteristic. This predisposition is an intrinsic property of the target keratinocytes and as such should be amenable to further study in isolated cells.

21751216|a|Differentiation of human hepatic progenitor cells to functional hepatocytes holds great potential to develop new therapeutic strategies for liver disease and to provide a platform for drug toxicity screens and identification of novel pharmaceuticals. We report here that human fetal hepatic progenitor cells (hFHPCs) efficiently differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells by continuous exposure to a combination of soluble factors for 7 days in vitro. We compared the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), oncostatin M (OSM), dexamethasone (DEX), or a combination on the expression of a liver-specific marker, albumin (ALB). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that, upon exposure to a combination of OSM, DEX, and HGF, the expression of ALB gradually increased in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the level of the hepatic progenitor cell marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) decreased as differentiation progressed. Moreover, cells exposed to the combination of OSM, DEX, and HGF gradually featured highly differentiated hepatic functions, including ALB secretion, glycogen storage, urea production, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity. The effect of these factors on the differentiation of hFHPCs may be blocked by U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a combination of soluble factors facilitates the efficient generation of highly differentiated hepatocyte-like cells from hFHPCs and ERK1/2 signaling pathway involved in this process. Results suggest that this system will be useful for generating functional hepatocytes and, hence, may serve as a cell source suitable for preclinical pharmacological research and testing.

24084484|t|Halo-substituted thiosemicarbazones and their copper(II), nickel(II) complexes: detailed spectroscopic characterization and study of antitumour activity against HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells.
24084484|a|Copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes of two different halogen substituted thiosemicarbazone ligands were synthesized. The ligands 3,4-difluoroacetophenone thiosemicarbazone (1) and 2-bromo-4'-chloroacetophenone thiosemicarbazone (2) were characterized and confirmed spectroscopically by FT-IR, FT-Raman, UV-vis and fluorescence spectral analysis, while the respective copper(II) complexes [Cu(C9H9N3F2S)2Cl2] (1a), [Cu(C9H9N3ClBrS)2Cl2] (2a) and nickel(II) complexes [Ni(C9H9N3F2S)2] (1b), [Ni(C9H9N3ClBrS)2] (2b) were characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR). The EPR spectra of the Cu(II) complexes provided the rhombic octahedral and axial symmetry of the complexes 1a and 2a respectively. For the complex 1a, the g values calculated as g1=2.1228, g2=2.0706 and g3=2.001 between 2900 and 3300 G. While for the complex 2a, a set of two resonance absorptions were observed. The synthesized compounds were tested for antitumor activity and showed that the ability to kill liver cancer cells significantly. Out of all the synthesized compounds, copper(II) complexes 1a and 2a showed high cytotoxic effect on liver cancer cells with 67.51% and 42.77% of cytotoxicity respectively at 100 µM.

9592981|t|Effects of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients treated with ProMACE-CytaBOM for HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
9592981|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The use of hematopoietic growth factors in association with chemotherapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been recommended, but few studies have evaluated its cost-effectiveness. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effects of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were analyzed in 33 consecutive patients with HIV-related NHL treated at a single institution with the same chemotherapy program, ProMACE-CytaBOM, with G-CSF, in 21 cases diagnosed after December 31, 1991, or without G-CSF, in 12 cases diagnosed earlier. Pearson's chi-square analysis and the two-sided Student's t-test were used for statistical comparisons. The method of Kaplan-Meyer and the log-rank-test were used for survival analyses. RESULTS: G-CSF support significantly reduced the frequency of day-1 drug dose reductions (p < 0.001) and of chemotherapy delays (p < 0.001), and improved the actual delivered doses of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (p < 0.02). In patients with a CD4+ count < 0.01 x 10(9)/L, chemotherapy could be given at full doses in 90% of cycles with G-CSF compared to only 20% without it. G-CSF affected neither the frequency and duration of fever and hospitalization nor the complete remission and survival rates after stratification according to the CD4+ count. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF support significantly improved dose-intensity in patients with HIV-related NHL treated with aggressive chemotherapy, particularly in the subgroup with a CD4+ count < 0.1 x 10(9)/L, but it did not improve their clinical outcome.

20838725|t|Serotonin and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: a possible therapeutic role for SSRIs?
20838725|a|Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare malignant arrhythmia, usually diagnosed in the adolescent years. The diagnosis can typically be made by one or more of the following: a positive family history, exercise electrocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring and/or an intra-cardiac, electrophysiological examination. This is a case report of a patient with CPVT that was refractory to treatment with beta-blockade and an implanted automatic cardioverter defibrillator. However, after a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) was added to the therapeutic regimen, no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred during the following two years.

7694975|t|Influence of timing of antibiotic administration on tissue concentrations during surgery.
7694975|a|BACKGROUND: Prophylactic antibiotics must be administered so as to achieve adequate tissue levels before the initial surgical incision. We characterized antimicrobial tissue concentrations following intravenous administration at various times prior to surgical incision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients scheduled for elective colorectal surgery were randomized to receive cefmetazole 2 g by intravenous push either immediately prior to incision or 15 to 60 minutes prior. Blood and wound-muscle samples were obtained at predetermined intervals and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Tissue distribution of the study drug was extremely rapid. All patients had theoretically adequate tissue levels at the time of incision. Levels above MIC90 of the common pathogens were sustained throughout the surgical procedure regardless of the timing of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of cefmetazole immediately prior to surgical incision should be effective prophylaxis for surgical wound infections.

23018901|t|In vivo probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy in amiodarone-related pneumonia.
23018901|a|Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) allows microscopic imaging of the alveoli during bronchoscopy. The objective of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pCLE for amiodarone-related pneumonia (AMR-IP). Alveolar pCLE was performed in 36 nonsmoking patients, including 33 consecutive patients with acute or subacute interstitial lung disease (ILD), of which 17 were undergoing treatment with amiodarone, and three were amiodarone-treated patients without ILD. Nine out of 17 patients were diagnosed with high-probability AMR-IP (HP-AMR-IP) by four experts, and three separate observers. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings did not differ between HP-AMR-IP and low-probability AMR-IP (LP-AMR-IP) patients. In HP-AMR-IP patients, pCLE showed large (>20 µm) and strongly fluorescent cells in 32 out of 38 alveolar areas. In contrast, these cells were observed in only two out of 39 areas from LP-AMR-IP patients, in one out of 59 areas from ILD patients not receiving amiodarone and in none of the 10 areas from amiodarone-treated patients without ILD (p<0.001; HP-AMR-IP versus other groups). The presence of at least one alveolar area with large and fluorescent cells had a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AMR-IP of 100%, 88%, 100% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, pCLE appears to be a valuable tool for the in vivo diagnosis of AMR-IP in subacute ILD patients.

9757552|a|Polyphenol extract from barley bran (BPE) induced nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing activity and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase activity in HL60 human myeloid leukemia cells. Because BPE induced the biochemical markers of HL60 cell differentiation, we investigated the effects of proanthocyanidins isolated from BPE on the HL60 cell differentiation of HL60 cells. Prodelphinidin B-3, T1, T2, and T3 induced 26-40% NBT-positive cells and 22-32% alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase-positive cells.

17418512|t|Regulatory effects of Codonopsis lanceolata on macrophage-mediated immune responses.
17418512|a|Codonopsis lanceolata L. has long been used as a folk medicine in Korea, Japan and China for the treatment of lung inflammatory diseases. In this study, therefore, we aimed to demonstrate its ethnopharmacological activity by examining macrophage-function regulating effects. The total methanol extracts of fresh leaves (l-TME) or roots (r-TME) of Codonopsis lanceolata L. significantly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide [NO] and tumor necrosis factor [TNF-alpha]) without altering mRNA levels. The expression of interleukin (IL)-3 and IL-6, however, was strongly diminished. According to the analysis of signaling enzyme activation by immunoblotting, phospho-IkappaB levels, a representative pro-inflammatory gene activation pathway, were not affected by the TMEs. By contrast, the Raf-ERK signaling pathway, which was involved in regulation of post-translational modification of pro-inflammatory gene products, was strongly blocked after 6-h of exposure. Moreover, l-TME down-regulated LPS-mediated phagocytic uptake and CD29-mediated cell-cell adhesion, while r-TME strongly up-regulated these two cellular events as well as fibronectin-cell adhesion. The surface levels of the costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) of RAW264.7 cells were also enhanced by these extracts. l-TME also diminished functional activation (assessed by NO production) and the surface level of dectin-1, but not toll-like receptor (TLR)-2. Taken together, these data suggest that Codonopsis lanceolata may have the ability to modulate macrophage-mediated immune responses, thus contributing to its anti-inflammatory activity.

22811345|t|Evaluation of potential interactions between mycophenolic acid derivatives and proton pump inhibitors.
22811345|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, impact of the complications on transplant outcomes, and the potential interactions between mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). DATA SOURCES: An unrestricted literature search (1980-January 2012) was performed with MEDLINE and EMBASE using the following key words: drug-drug interaction, enteric-coated mycophenolic acid, GI complications, mycophenolate mofetil, solid organ transplant, and proton pump inhibitor, including individual agents within the class. Abstracts from scientific meetings were also evaluated. Additionally, reference citations from identified publications were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant English-language, original research articles and review articles were evaluated if they focused on any of the topics identified in the search or included substantial content addressing GI complications in SOT recipients or drug interactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: GI complications are frequent among SOT recipients, with some studies showing prevalence rates as high as 70%. Transplant outcomes among renal transplant recipients are significantly impacted by GI complications, especially in patients requiring immunosuppressant dosage reductions or premature discontinuation. To this end, PPI use among patients receiving transplants is common. Recent data demonstrate that PPIs significantly reduce the overall exposure to MPA after oral administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Similar studies show this interaction does not exist between PPIs and enteric-coated mycophenolic acid (EC-MPA). Unfortunately, most of the available data evaluating this interaction are pharmacokinetic analyses that do not investigate the clinical impact of this interaction. CONCLUSIONS: A significant interaction exists between PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil secondary to reduced dissolution of mycophenolate mofetil in higher pH environments. EC-MPA is not absorbed in the stomach; therefore, low intragastric acidity does not impact EC-MPA and bioavailability is maintained with this formulation during PPI coadministration. The clinical impact of this interaction is unknown, yet one can theorize that reduced exposure to MPA in SOT recipients can increase the risk of allograft rejection and/or failure.

11604189|t|The effect of steroids on the biophysical profile and Doppler indices of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries in healthy preterm fetuses.
11604189|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of antenatal steroids on the biophysical profile and the Doppler parameters of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries of healthy fetuses. STUDY DESIGN: Thiry-five singleton pregnancies between the gestational ages of 28 and 34 weeks, who received two consecutive doses of betamethasone 24h apart to accelerate pulmonary maturation were prospectively studied. Fetal biophysical profile and Doppler assessment were performed at 0 (pre-steroid), 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after the administration of first dose. We compared the percentage of the fetuses with biophysical parameters present for each of the five components of the biophysical profile and the Doppler indices, using Cochran's Q-test, Friedman's test and one way analysis of variance of repeated measures where appropriate. The statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. RESULTS: The mean delivery time was 36.9(+/-1.8) weeks. There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of the following findings in the pre- compared to post-steroid measurements: absence of body movements (48 h, P<0.05), non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings (24, 48 and 72 h, P<0.05) and absence of breathing movements (24, 48 and 72 h, p<0.05). Initially none of the biophysical profile score was <or=6, whereas at 24, 48 and 72 h, 13.3, 76.7, 16.7% of them, respectively, were <or=6 (P<0.05). None of the Doppler indices was found to be affected by the steroid administration. CONCLUSION: Maternal betamethasone administration can cause a significant but transient, reduction in biophysical profile scores, however the middle cerebral and umbilical artery Doppler indices were found to be unaffected suggesting the reliability of this modality for the evaluation of the fetuses previously exposed to the antenatal steroids.

20828223|t|The bedtime administration ameliorates blood pressure variability and reduces urinary albumin excretion in amlodipine-olmesartan combination therapy.
20828223|a|Chronotherapy has the potential to improve blood pressure (BP) variability and to decrease stroke and cardiovascular events. The present study examined the efficacy and safety of the bedtime administration in amlodipine-olmesartan combination therapy, as compared with the morning administration. The present study was an open-label, randomized crossover study of the effects of the morning vs. bedtime administration of amlodipine-olmesartan combination. The subject was 31 essential hypertensive patients. Morning BP surge (MBPS) and nocturnal BP pattern were analyzed from ambulatory BP data. Glucose and lipid profiles and cardiovascular-renal data were also collected. The bedtime administration reduced MBPS significantly (24.2  ± 13.5 mmHg vs. 32.3  ± 14.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) with no excessive nocturnal BP fall. In nondipper, the bedtime administration significantly improved nocturnal BP. On the other hand, it did not reduce nocturnal BP in dipper. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was lower in the bedtime administration than in the morning administration (42.5  ± 59.9 mg/g vs. 75.3  ± 26.4 mg/g, p = 0.044). In amlodipine-olmesartan combination therapy, the bedtime administration reduced better MBPS with correcting nocturnal BP fall and improved urinary albumin excretion. The bedtime dosing of amlodipine and olmesartan seems more apt than the morning dose to obtain the therapeutic goal.

9183752|t|Posterior chamber silicone phakic intraocular lens.
9183752|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the efficacy, safety, and stability of correction achieved with a silicone posterior chamber intraocular lens used to correct high myopia in phakic eyes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A silicone posterior chamber plate-style intraocular lens (Chiron, Adatomed) was implanted in 38 consecutive phakic eyes with high myopia (-7.00 to -28.00 diopters (D) over a period of 21 months. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 24 months. RESULTS: Three months after surgery, refractions in 27 eyes (71%) ranged from -1.00 to +1.00 D and remained stable thereafter. Spectacle-corrected visual acuity improved at least two lines in 24 eyes (63%), and none was lost in any eye. Patient satisfaction was high (92%). The few complications that occurred were mostly related to imperfections in the surgical technique rather than lack of biocompatibility of the lens. No cataract or other vision-threatening complication was present at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: This silicone posterior chamber plate-style intraocular lens provides a reasonably predictable, safe, and stable means of correcting high myopia.

14987801|t|ABL-fusion oncoproteins activate multi-pathway of DNA repair: role in drug resistance?
14987801|a|Chromosomal translocations of tyrosine kinase c-ABL gene from chromosome 9 may generate oncogenic kinases exhibiting constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, we have shown that ABL-fusion oncogenic tyrosine kinases, BCR/ABL and TEL/ABL, specific to hematopoietic malignances, induced resistance to DNA-damaging agents. To elucidate the role of DNA repair in this phenomenon we examined the capacity of murine BaF3 lymphoid cells and their TEL/ABL-transformed counterparts to repair DNA lesions caused by gamma- and UV-radiations and the anti-cancer drug, idarubicin. TEL/ABL-transformed cells displayed resistance to these DNA damaging agents as evaluated by MTT assay and the survival advantage was associated with an accelerated kinetics of DNA repair as measured by the alkaline comet assay. Deoxyribonucleosides (dNTPs) supplementation of the repair medium further stimulated DNA repair and the effect was specific to the DNA damage agent used in the experiment but only the transformed cells displayed this feature. A variety of damages induced imply the multi-pathway of DNA repair involved. We also examined the capability of BCR/ABL-fusion to modulate the repair of oxidative lesions, considered as a major side effect of various anti-cancer drugs including idarubicin and radiation. Employing the free radical scavenger alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, a spin trap) and DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (EndoIII) that nicks DNA at sites of oxidized bases, we found that BCR/ABL-transformed cells repaired oxidative DNA lesions more effectively than control cells. Our results suggest, that oncogenic ABL-dependent stimulation of DNA repair may contribute to the cell resistance to genotoxic treatment.

20601631|t|Sensory detection and responses to toxic gases: mechanisms, health effects, and countermeasures.
20601631|a|The inhalation of reactive gases and vapors can lead to severe damage of the airways and lung, compromising the function of the respiratory system. Exposures to oxidizing, electrophilic, acidic, or basic gases frequently occur in occupational and ambient environments. Corrosive gases and vapors such as chlorine, phosgene, and chloropicrin were used as warfare agents and in terrorist acts. Chemical airway exposures are detected by the olfactory, gustatory, and nociceptive sensory systems that initiate protective physiological and behavioral responses. This review focuses on the role of airway nociceptive sensory neurons in chemical sensing and discusses the recent discovery of neuronal receptors for reactive chemicals. Using physiological, imaging, and genetic approaches, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels in sensory neurons were shown to respond to a wide range of noxious chemical stimuli, initiating pain, respiratory depression, cough, glandular secretions, and other protective responses. TRPA1, a TRP ion channel expressed in chemosensory C-fibers, is activated by almost all oxidizing and electrophilic chemicals, including chlorine, acrolein, tear gas agents, and methyl isocyanate, the highly noxious chemical released in the Bhopal disaster. Chemicals likely activate TRPA1 through covalent protein modification. Animal studies using TRPA1 antagonists or TRPA1-deficient mice confirmed the role of TRPA1 in chemically induced respiratory reflexes, pain, and inflammation in vivo. New research shows that sensory neurons are not merely passive sensors of chemical exposures. Sensory channels such as TRPA1 are essential for maintenance of airway inflammation in asthma and may contribute to the progression of airway injury following high-level chemical exposures.

19533082|t|Rosiglitazone enhances glucose uptake in glomerular podocytes using the glucose transporter GLUT1.
19533082|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonists are used increasingly in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the context of renal disease, PPARgamma agonists reduce microalbuminuria in diabetic nephropathy; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. Glomerular podocytes are newly characterised insulin-sensitive cells and there is good evidence that they are targeted in diabetic nephropathy. In this study we investigated the functional and molecular effects of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone on human podocytes. METHODS: Conditionally immortalised human podocytes were cultured with rosiglitazone and functional effects were measured with glucose-uptake assays. The effect of rosiglitazone on glucose uptake was also measured in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, nephrin-deficient podocytes, human glomerular endothelial cells, proximal tubular cells and podocytes treated with the NEFA palmitate. The role of the glucose transporter GLUT1 was investigated with immunofluorescence and small interfering RNA knockdown and the plasma membrane expression of GLUT1 was determined with bis-mannose photolabelling. RESULTS: Rosiglitazone significantly increased glucose uptake in wild-type podocytes and this was associated with translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane. This effect was blocked with GLUT1 small interfering RNA. Nephrin-deficient podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells and proximal tubular cells did not increase glucose uptake in response to either insulin or rosiglitazone. Furthermore, rosiglitazone significantly increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake when podocytes were treated with the NEFA palmitate. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, rosiglitazone has a direct and protective effect on glucose uptake in wild-type human podocytes. This represents a novel mechanism by which PPARgamma agonists may improve podocyte function in diabetic nephropathy.

17987590|t|Prevalence of purchase of antihypertensive and serum lipid-reducing drugs in Sweden--individual data from national registers.
17987590|a|PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of purchase of prescribed antihypertensive and/or serum lipid-reducing pharmaceutical preparations among different age groups, from the age of 45, in the Swedish population. Further, to calculate the percentage of the population, from the age of 60, who purchased these pharmaceuticals without having had a circulatory diagnosis in the Hospital Discharge Register the last 7 years, or having purchased nitrate vasodilators, as an attempt to estimate the proportion of primary preventive treatments. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, of individual data on prescriptions for antihypertensives (C02-C03, C07-C09) and serum lipid-reducing agents (C10), dispensed from July to December 2005 for the Swedish population. Data were obtained from the new Swedish Prescribed Drugs Register. The data were related to population statistics, and linked to data on diagnoses of cardiovascular disease (I00-I99), from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register 1998-2004. Data on individuals with purchase of antihypertensive or serum lipid-reducing agents, but without a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, were also linked to purchase of nitrate vasodilators (C01D). RESULTS: Among Swedes of 60 years and above, 53% purchased antihypertensive or serum lipid-reducing pharmaceuticals, and 30% purchased the pharmaceuticals without having been hospitalized for a coronary or cerebrovascular event during the previous 7 years, or having purchased prescribed nitrate vasodilators during 6 months. CONCLUSION: Over half of the Swedish senior population purchased prescribed antihypertensive or serum lipid-reducing drugs during 6 months in 2005. The magnitude of the prevalence points to the importance of intensified follow-up of both adverse effects and of effectiveness of these drugs.

1940488|t|The reproducibility of bioavailability of oral morphine from solution under fed and fasted conditions.
1940488|a|The reproducibility in bioavailability of orally administered morphine (as a solution) under fed and fasted conditions was studied in 5 patients with chronic pain on three occasions over 1 yr (0, 6, and 12 mo). During each study period (i.e.. 0, 6, and 12 mo), patients received the 50 mg oral dose both in the fasted state (10 hr since food) and immediately after a high fat content breakfast, in randomly determined sequence. Frequent blood samples were collected for 10 hr after the dose. There was no significant difference in the maximum blood morphine concentration (Cmax) or the time to Cmax among the three study periods or between the fed and fasted states. Bioavailability, as assessed by log(AUC), was significantly greater in the fed compared to the fasted state (P less than .01) but did not differ over the three study periods (Two-factor analysis of variance). Intrapatient variability contributed 32% and 54% to total variation in log(AUC) under fed and fasted conditions, respectively.

23898780|t|Bioaccessibility of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: relevance to toxicity and carcinogenesis.
23898780|a|INTRODUCTION: Bioaccessibility is a growing area of research in the field of risk assessment. As polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, they are the toxicants of focus to establish cancer risks in humans. Orally ingested PAHs also cause toxicity and even affect the pharmacokinetic behavior of some therapeutic agents. Toward this end, bioaccessibility is being used as a tool to assess the risk of PAHs via dietary exposures. AREAS COVERED: This review covers some in vitro bioaccessibility models for PAHs that have been used for the past one-and-a-half decade. This review also considers the factors that influence bioaccessibility and debates the merits and limitations of using a bioaccessibility concept for estimating risk from ingestion of PAH-contaminated soil and food. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of bioaccessibility for PAH-induced toxicity and cancers in the context of risk assessment. EXPERT OPINION: So far, much of the focus on PAH bioaccessibility is centered on soil as a preferential matrix. However, ingestion of PAHs through diet far exceeds the amount accidentally ingested through soil. Therefore, bioaccessibility could be exploited as a tool to assess the relative risk of various dietary ingredients tainted with PAHs. While bioaccessibility is a promising approach for assessing PAH risk arising from various types of contaminated soils, none of the models proposed appears to be valid. Bioaccessibility values, derived from in vitro studies, still require validation from in vivo studies.

15753847|t|Efficacy and safety outcomes among de novo renal transplant recipients managed by C2 monitoring of cyclosporine a microemulsion: results of a 12-month, randomized, multicenter study.
15753847|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical benefits of C2 monitoring of cyclosporine microemulsion have been demonstrated, but C2 targets in renal transplant recipients during the first year require validation. METHODS: MO2ART was a prospective, multicenter study of renal transplant recipients managed by C2 monitoring of cyclosporine microemulsion with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients were randomized on day 3 to two groups, which were managed from month 3 with higher or lower C2 target ranges (months 4-6, 1,000-1,200 ng/mL vs. 800-1,000 ng/mL; months 7-12, 800-1,000 ng/mL vs. 600-800 ng/mL, respectively). The primary endpoint was the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at month 12. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were recruited, of whom 250 remained in the study at 3 months (higher-C2, n=131; lower-C2, n=119). GFR at 12 months did not differ between the higher- and lower-C2 groups (65+/-17 mL/min vs. 66+/-14 mL/min). When patients were regrouped according to C2 achieved by months 8 to 12, those with the lowest C2 (<700 ng/mL) showed the lowest GFR at month 3 and the most pronounced increase in GFR between month 3 and month 12 (P=0.04). Five episodes of biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred after month 3 (higher-C2 group, n=2; lower-C2 group, n=3). The overall 12-month Kaplan-Meier incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 13.7%. Patient and graft survival were 93% and 89%, respectively, at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Both C2 target ranges investigated showed excellent and nearly equivalent outcomes at 12 months. The decision to target the higher or lower end of these C2 ranges should be made on an individual basis, taking into account patient and graft characteristics, and co-medication.

16359376|t|Mycophenolic acid clinical pharmacokinetics influenced by a cyclosporine C2 based immunosuppressive regimen in renal allograft recipients.
16359376|a|Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in combination with cyclosporine 2-h concentration (CsA C2, n = 68) or tacrolimus trough concentration (n = 10) was investigated by repeated measurements of MPA and MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) trough concentrations in renal allograft recipients during the first 3 months post-transplant. The acute rejection rate was lower (19% vs. 43%; P < 0.05) in patients achieving CsA C2 target range during the first week (1600-2000 microg/l), n = 26, compared with those who did not, n = 42. Median MPA concentration was 0.9 and 1.2 microg/ml in patients within or below C2 range, respectively (P = 0.19). CsA C2 correlated with MPAG-to-MPA ratio (P < 0.01, r = 0.91) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT, P < 0.01, r = 0.86). Total MPA concentration increased during the 3 months, but not in patients on tacrolimus. High CsA C2 lowered the acute rejection rate and plasma MPA. High CsA C2 is associated with elevated GGT, probably because of cholestatic effects, which explain the increased MPAG-to-MPA ratio. Increasing MPA concentration is ascribed to per-protocol CsA C2 reductions. In conclusion, CsA may confound the relationship between MPA and the incidence of rejection, and contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a therapeutic range for MPA in clinical practice.

17285425|t|Comparison of the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil on splanchnic tissue perfusion during cardiac surgery.
17285425|a|The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of fentanyl and remifentanil on splanchnic perfusion during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Fifty patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (10 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 5 microgxkg(-1)xh(-1) infusion for maintenance) or remifentanil (3 microgxkg(-1) at induction and 1 microgxkg(-1)xmin(-1) infusion for maintenance). Patients in both groups were comparable with regard to demographics. Intraoperative volume management and inotropic therapy were similiar in both groups. Regarding heart rate, there were no significant differences between the groups at any measurement time (P > 0.05). Compared to the fentanyl group, the remifentanil group showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure during induction. Also, the gastric intramucosal CO(2) pressure (Pg(CO) (2)) and the P(CO) (2)-gap, defined as the difference between Pg(CO) (2) and Pa(CO) (2), were significantly increased and the gastric mucosal pH (pHi) was significantly decreased in the remifentanil group in the postinduction period (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in respiratory data at any time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Both fentanyl and remifentanil seemed to be effective and well tolerated in this CABG population. Episodes of hypotension and transient reduction in splanchnic perfusion were more common in patients treated with remifentanil when compared to those receiving the fentanyl opioid regimen.

19733695|t|Alterations in the serum levels of soluble L, P and E-selectin 20 years after sulfur mustard exposure: Sardasht-Iran Cohort Study.
19733695|a|The selectins (L, P and E) are carbohydrate-binding membrane glycoproteins acting as adhesion molecules involved in the development of different inflammatory reactions. Various eye, skin and lung diseases are associated with induction of soluble selectins. In this study serum levels of soluble forms of selectins (sL-selectin, sP-selectin and sE-selectin) were evaluated in the sulfur mustard (SM) exposed and the control groups using ELISA method. sL-selectin was significantly lower in the SM exposed group compared to the control group (1131.5+/-16.3 and 1205.7+/-26.9 pg/ml respectively; p=0.021). The serum levels of sP-Selectin was significantly reduced in the SM exposed group in comparison to the control group (149.35+/-2.61 and 170.25+/-5.16 pg/ml respectively; p<0.001). sE-selectin was significantly increased in sera of the exposed group compared to the control group (29.64+/-0.902 and 24.61+/-1.26 pg/ml respectively; p=0.003). sL-selectin positively correlated with the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells and negatively with the percentage of lymphocytes. There was a significant correlation between the count of platelets and sP-selectin in both the control and exposed groups. The change in the pattern of selectins in the SM exposed group in comparison to the control group may indicate suppressed acute inflammatory condition in which new remodeling of cytokine expression play a more crucial role in the immune-regulation.

23983610|t|B19, a novel monocarbonyl analogue of curcumin, induces human ovarian cancer cell apoptosis via activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the autophagy signaling pathway.
23983610|a|BACKGROUND: The unfolded protein response, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis regulate tumor cell fate and have become novel signaling targets for the development of cancer therapeutic drugs. Curcumin has been used to treat several different cancers, including ovarian cancer, in clinical trials and research; however, the role of ER stress and autophagy in the therapeutic effects of curcumin and new curcumin analogues remains unclear. METHODS: Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry with PI/Annexin V-FITC staining. The expression levels of ER stress- and autophagy-related proteins were analyzed by western blotting. The activation of autophagy was detected using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: We demonstrated that B19 induced HO8910 cell apoptosis in a dose-responsive manner. We also determined and that this effect was associated with corresponding increases in a series of key components in the UPR and ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathways, followed by caspase 3 cleavage and activation. We also observed that B19 treatment induced autophagy in HO8910 cells. The inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) increased levels of intracellular misfolded proteins, which enhanced ovarian cancer apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ER stress and autophagy may play a role in the apoptosis that is induced by the curcumin analogue B19 in an epithelial ovarian cancer cell line and that autophagy inhibition can increase curcumin analogue-induced apoptosis by inducing severe ER stress.

15299240|t|Patterned layers of adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins: influence on mammalian cell adhesion.
15299240|a|Three patterned systems aiming at the control of mammalian cell behavior are presented. The determinant feature common to these systems is the spatial distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (mainly collagen) on polymer substrates. This distribution differs from one system to another with respect to the scale at which it is affected, from the supracellular to the supramolecular scale, and with respect to the way it is produced. In the first system, the surface of polystyrene was oxidized selectively to form micrometer-scale patterns, using photolithography. Adsorption of ECM proteins in presence of a competitor was enhanced on the oxidized domains, allowing selective cell adhesion to be achieved. In the second system, electron beam lithography was used to engrave grooves (depth and width approximately 1 microm) on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substratum. No modification of the surface chemistry associated to the created topography could be detected. Cell orientation along the grooves was only observed when collagen was preadsorbed on the substratum. In the third system, collagen adsorbed on PMMA was dried in conditions ensuring the formation of a nanometer-scale pattern. Cell adhesion was enhanced on such patterned collagen layers compared to smooth collagen layers.

24862616|a|INTRODUCTION: Anthracyclines are important anticancer drugs, but their use is limited by acute and chronic cardiotoxicity. Current approaches to surveillance are often inadequate to detect myocardial disease. Strain imaging might detect earlier myocardial dysfunction. Speckle analysis of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography improves information about left ventricular (LV) segmental and global deformation by avoiding the loss of speckles seen in monoplane bidimensional-strain analysis. We assessed whether early 3D-strain analysis could predict later anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Echocardiography, troponin T (TnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were used to evaluate 59 patients (age 51  ± 10 years) before, and at 12 and 36 weeks after anthracycline treatment. LV global longitudinal strain (3DGLS), global radial strain (3DGRS) and global circumferential strain (3DGCS) were determined using 3D-strain imaging before and after 12 weeks of chemotherapy. Percentage changes from baseline to 12 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy () were calculated for all parameters analysed. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, eight patients (13.5%) developed cardiotoxicity. At 12 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy, isovolumic relaxation time, 3DGLS, 3DGCS and 3DGRS had deteriorated and troponin was elevated (all p<0.05), before any decrease in LV ejection fraction. Cumulative anthracycline dose at 12 weeks, LVEF, 3DGLS and TnT were predictors of the later development of cardiotoxicity on univariate logistic regression. By multiple logistic regression, 3DGLS emerged as the only independent predictor of later cardiotoxicity (Odds ratio 1.09, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline therapy induced early deterioration of 3DGLS, 3DGCS and 3DGRS. 3DGLS seems to be a good predictor of the future development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

23218455|t|The effects of caffeine abstinence on sleep: a pilot study.
23218455|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to examine whether caffeine abstinence in the evening could improve the sleep quality of those who habitually consume coffee. DESIGN: A double-blind control group design (caffeine and caffeine-free groups). SETTING: A university. SUBJECTS: A convenience sampling of 10 students (mean age 21.4 years). METHODS: It was a 14-day experiment. For the first 7 days, all participants consumed caffeinated coffee. In the following 7 days, subjects consumed caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee according to their assigned group. MEASURES: Sleep-wake parameters, self-reported sleep quality and level of refreshment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences (p>.05) among the data of the two groups identified. No significant changes (p>.05) were found in the sleep quality of either group during the study. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that caffeine abstinence in the evening might not be helpful in sleep promotion. It highlights the need to implement evidence-based practice in health promotion.

1864010|t|Soluble IL-2 receptor and CD25 cells in psoriasis: effects of cyclosporin A and PUVA therapy.
1864010|a|A study was conducted to quantify soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in sera of 57 chronic plaque psoriasis patients and correlate these measurements with disease activity and the number of IL-2R-positive (CD25+) lymphocytes in lesional biopsies of 11 cyclosporin A (CsA) and 13 psoralen plus ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) treated patients. Levels of sIL-2R showed a strong correlation with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). CsA and PUVA significantly reduced the PASI and sIL-2R levels to a similar degree after 4 weeks of treatment. Although the majority of CsA-treated patients who were biopsied showed reductions in lesional CD25+ cells, these did not reach statistical significance; in five patients biopsied who had PUVA treatment, no consistent effect on the numbers of CD25+ cells was observed. A significant correlation was found between CD25+ cells in lesional biopsies and the PASI score.

19558205|t|Environmental fate factors and human intake fractions for risk assessment of petroleum products.
19558205|a|Petroleum products may contain up to thousands of individual hydrocarbon compounds, which vary widely in environmental behavior and ecotoxicity. Environmental risk assessment of these complex substances is facilitated by use of the hydrocarbon block method (HBM). The HBM assigns similarly behaving hydrocarbons to the same blocks and then relates release rates of petroleum products to environmental concentrations and human intake rates by means of so-called environmental fate factors and human intake fractions of the hydrocarbon blocks. We have derived such fate factors and intake fractions and associated uncertainties with a library of representative hydrocarbon structures. Fate factors and intake fractions of over 1500 individual representative hydrocarbons have been modeled according to the EU Technical Guidance Documents. Fate factors and intake fractions for the chosen hydrocarbon blocks are then estimated from average values obtained for the individual compounds in the blocks. Fate factors and intake fractions of the hydrocarbon blocks vary by up to 10 orders of magnitude for the different emission scenarios and compartments/spatial scales. The highest fate factors are obtained for the exposure scenarios with the highest emission intensity (the local emission scenarios) and for the most direct exposure chain. Uncertainties introduced by the   blocking   method are typically smaller than 30% and rarely larger than a factor of 3. Various hydrocarbon blocking schemes of different resolution were tested, and all schemes investigated appeared to perform satisfactorily. The use of the library-based HBM was illustrated by assessing the aquatic ecological risk of gas oil, emitted to water. The aquatic risk characterization ratio of gas oil hydrocarbons in regional freshwater is estimated to be 6   ×   10( 5) per unit of emission (1   kg/d released 1:10:100 to local, regional, and continental scales, respectively), with an uncertainty of 32%. In view of other uncertainties in environmental risk assessment, the precision achieved with the procedure presented here is judged to be reasonable.

20809477|t|Secondary hemophagocytic syndrome in adults: a case series of 18 patients in a single institution and a review of literature.
20809477|a|Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is rare in adults and is usually fatal without treatment. We present a consecutive series of 18 adults with HLH diagnosed at our institution between 2004 and 2009. All diagnoses were confirmed by pathology. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range: 18-73 years), with a male: female ratio of 2:1. Patients uniformly presented with fever. Fifty-five per cent of the patients presented with evidence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. All of the patients had at least a bi- or trilineage cytopenia. Elevated liver enzymes, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperfibrinogenemia were seen in 50, 100, 40 and 50% of patients, respectively. The presumed causes were as follows; haematological malignancies (n   =   4), post-autologous stem cell transplant (n   =   2), infection (n   =   2), rheumatologic illness (n   =   2), sickle cell disease (n   =   1), post-orthotopic liver transplant (n   =   1) and idiopathic (n   =   3). The median time from suspicion to diagnosis was 5 days (1-27 days). Corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine were the most frequently used treatment regimen. Other agents used were etoposide, IVIG, cyclophosphamide and chemotherapy. The mortality rate was 72%, with multi-system organ failure being the most common cause of death. Median survival time from diagnosis was 35 days. Six patients are alive to date. In a univariate analysis, the presence of fever was the only factor that was statistically significant for predicting a poor prognosis (early mortality) (p   =   0.05). In conclusion, a high index of suspicion is the critical factor for early diagnosis. Early treatment with immunosuppressant is warranted, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation to identify the underlying cause should be undertaken.

7548496|t|Ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cholera: a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of a single daily dose in Peruvian adults.
7548496|a|We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial to compare ciprofloxacin (250 mg once a day for 3 days) with tetracycline (500 mg four times a day for 3 days) in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of moderate-to-severe cholera in Peruvian adults. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. A total of 202 patients (102 in the tetracycline group and 100 in the ciprofloxacin group) were included in the efficacy analysis. The clinical and bacteriologic efficacies of the two regimens were similar. The study drugs were well tolerated. We conclude that ciprofloxacin given once a day is as effective as the standard tetracycline regimen for the treatment of cholera in adults. The ciprofloxacin regimen may represent an alternative to the standard treatment in areas where Vibrio cholerae O1 strains that are resistant to commonly used antimicrobials are prevalent.

24517869|t|Cilostazol improves lymphatic function by inducing proliferation and stabilization of lymphatic endothelial cells.
24517869|a|BACKGROUND: Cilostazol, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type III, is an antiplatelet agent and vasodilator. Some clinical reports have suggested that this drug can improve progressive and refractory lymphedema. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated whether cilostazol has the potential to proliferate lymphatic vessels and to improve lymphatic function using human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and mouse lymphedema models. METHODS: Human LECs were counted at several time points while they were cultured in the presence of cilostazol and/or protein kinase A inhibitor. After receiving a diet including 0.1% cilostazol or control diet, skin tissue and lymphatic function of k-cyclin transgenic (kCYC(+/-)) mice, which have pernicious lymphatic dysfunction, was analyzed. A different lymphedema model was generated in wild type mice by excising circumferential tail skin to remove the superficial lymphatics. After oral administration of cilostazol, tail lymphedema was examined in this mouse model. RESULTS: Proliferation of LECs was promoted in a dose-dependent manner, which was partially inhibited by a protein kinase A inhibitor. Lymphatic vessel count increased in the cilostazol-treated kCYC(+/-) mice over that in the non-treated mice. Lymph flow improved in cilostazol-fed kCYC(+/-) mice as assessed by subcutaneous injection of Evans blue dye into the footpad. Oral administration of cilostazol also decreased lymphedema in a tail of wild type mice. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol promoted growth of human LECs and improved lymph flow and lymphedema in two different mouse lymphedema models. These results suggest that cilostazol would be a promising agent for the treatment of lymphedema.

19588382|t|Erythropoietin as an adjuvant treatment with (chemo) radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.
19588382|a|BACKGROUND: Tumour hypoxia increases tumour invasiveness and has a negative impact on response to therapy. Hypoxic tumours are also associated with severely anaemic individuals. It has therefore been hypothesised that correcting anaemia, by increasing haemoglobin levels using erythropoietin, improves tumour oxygenation and consequently the patient's prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether combined treatment with radiotherapy and erythropoietin (RT plus EPO) is better than standard radiotherapy (RT alone) for the treatment of head and neck cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 24 February 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two independent authors assessed identified studies according to the eligibility criteria: RCTs which delivered radiotherapy combined with or without erythropoietin, in patients of any age with head and neck cancer of any stage or type. In addition, trials administering concomitant iron therapy among one or both arms were also eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For statistical analysis of survival data, we computed a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across studies. We used Chi(2) heterogeneity tests to test for statistical heterogeneity among trials and performed the statistical analyses using Review Manager 5.0. MAIN RESULTS: Five RCTs with a total of 1397 patients were included. Pooled data yielded a significantly worse overall survival (OS) for RT plus EPO as compared to RT alone (Peto odds ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.005, five trials). For local regional tumour control (LRTC) analyses resulted in a small but non-significant difference between the RT alone group and the RT plus EPO group (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03; P = 0.15, four trials). In addition, the local regional progression free survival (LRPFS) measured in four studies was significantly different between groups (Peto odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.80; P = 0.0002, four trials), in favour of the RT alone group. Two studies used supplemental iron in the RT plus EPO group and not in the RT alone group. When excluding these studies from the analyses, the statistically (non-) significant differences in OS, LRTC and LRPFS are maintained. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are strong suggestions that RT plus EPO has a negative influence on outcome as opposed to RT alone. However, the target haemoglobin concentration, which was higher than recommended in four of the five included RCTs, may have had a significant role. Nevertheless, based on these findings EPO should not be administered as an addition to RT outside the experimental setting for patients with head and neck cancer.

18234565|t|Effect of exogenous catecholamines on tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and beta-endorphin levels following severe trauma.
18234565|a|Cytokines and endogenous opioids are mediators of the post traumatic inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exogenous catecholamines on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and beta(beta)-endorphin levels in patients with severe trauma, during the first 24 h after injury. Forty four traumatized patients with haemorrhage class III and IV were included in the study. Patients were divided in two groups: Group 1 (adrenergic, n=22) and Group 2 (non adrenergic, n=22), depending on the use of exogenous catecholamines. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 24 h time points. Baseline values were different between the two groups, but an altered pattern of release was observed for TNFa, IL-6, IL-10 and beta-endorphin levels in patients treated with catecholamines. ICU stay was longer for the adrenergic group, while survival after 1 month was significantly lower. Findings support an altered pattern of cytokine release during the early phase after trauma, probably due to catecholamine presence.

22847201|t|Lipid-lowering effect of fluvastatin in relation to cytochrome P450 2C9 variant alleles frequently distributed in the Czech population.
22847201|a|BACKGROUND: CYP2C9*3 allele has been reported to correlate with increased plasma concentration of fluvastatin active form in healthy volunteers. We analyzed the correlation between the CYP2C9 genotype and cholesterol-lowering effect of fluvastatin in human hypercholesterolemic patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study was prospective, without any interventions to standard procedures of hypolipidemic treatment. CYP2C9 genotype was determined by PCR-RFLP assay in 87 patients on concomitant fluvastatin therapy, in 48 patients on monotherapy, and in a control group of 254 healthy volunteers of Czech nationality. Biochemical and clinical data were collected before the initiation of fluvastatin treatment and 12 weeks later. RESULTS: The frequency of CYP2C9 alleles did not differ significantly among groups of patients and volunteers. The most frequently observed allele was CYP2C9*2. Treatment with 80 mg of fluvastatin daily of 48 patients on monotherapy for 12 weeks resulted in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction by 25%, mean serum total cholesterol (TC) reduction by 21%, and mean triglyceride (TG) reduction by 28%. The CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype was associated with a decrease in LDL-C levels (by 40.0% for CYP2C9*1/*3, but only by 22.4% for CYP2C9*1/*1), and with the reduction of TC (by 28.6% in CYP2C9*1/*3 versus 20.2% in CYP2C9*1/*1). CONCLUSIONS: In hypercholesterolemic patients, LDL-C serum concentration was decreased more significantly in fluvastatin-treated subjects bearing the CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype compared to CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype. However, due to rare occurrence of some CYP genotypes, it was impossible to report a definitive positive genotype-fluvastatin effect association.

15931603|t|Two days of a very low calorie diet reduces endogenous glucose production in obese type 2 diabetic patients despite the withdrawal of blood glucose-lowering therapies including insulin.
15931603|a|The mechanism of the blood glucose-lowering effect of a 2-day very low calorie diet (VLCD; 1890 kJ/d) in combination with the cessation of all blood glucose-lowering agents was studied in 12 (7 women, 5 men) obese (body mass index, 36.3 +/- 1.0 kg/m 2 [mean +/- SEM]) type 2 diabetic patients (age, 55 +/- 4 years; HbA 1c , 7.3% +/- 0.4%) undergoing insulin therapy. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and whole body glucose disposal (6,6 2 H 2 -glucose), lipolysis ( 2 H 5 -glycerol), and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) rates were measured before and after the intervention in basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions. After 2 days of a VLCD and discontinuation of all blood glucose-lowering therapies, fasting plasma glucose levels did not increase (11.3 +/- 1.3 vs 10.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/L). Basal EGP significantly declined (14.2 +/- 1.0 to 11.9 +/- 0.7 mu mol/kg per minute; P = .009). Basal metabolic clearance rate of glucose and rate of basal lipolysis did not change. During hyperinsulinemia, EGP (5.5 +/- 0.8 to 5.2 +/- 0.5 mu mol/kg per minute), whole body glucose disposal (12.1 +/- 0.7 to 11.3 +/- 1.0 mu mol/kg per minute), the metabolic clearance rate of glucose, and the rate of lipolysis did not change after the 2-day intervention. Cessation of blood glucose-lowering therapy in combination with a 2-day VLCD does not lead to hyperglycemia and is associated with a reduction in basal EGP. Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal did not improve, nor did insulin suppressibility of EGP and lipolysis.

1681017|t|Alterations in water content of the stratum corneum following long-term topical corticosteroids.
1681017|a|The water content of the stratum corneum (SC), profilaggrin/filaggrin (PF/FG) and stratum corneum neutral lipids were examined in 23 patients following use of long-term topical corticosteroids (TCS). All patients showed the rebound phenomenon after stopping TCS. Biopsy specimens were taken from the atrophic skin and from the peripheral normal skin of patients. The histopathological examination showed a thinning of the horny layer and the epidermis, along with a decrease in or the absence of the granular layer in the patient's lesional skin. Oil red 0 staining for SC neutral lipids revealed that the intensity of the lipid staining was markedly reduced. Ultrastructural observation also revealed an obvious decrease in both the formation of keratohyalin granules and in the membrane-coating granules of steroid-treated skin. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence for PF/FG demonstrated markedly reduced immunofluorescence. In agreement with the above results, the mean water content of the SC in lesional skin was also significantly decreased when compared with that of controls. Since the water content of SC is suggested to be dependent on both the keratohyalin-derived natural moisturizing agents of the SC and the SC intercellular lipids, the present results suggest that the diminution in SC lipids and PF/FG in steroid-treated skin may play an important role in the low hydration state of the SC and the clinical manifestations of scaling and dryness of the skin in patients suffering from the rebound phenomenon after stopping TCS.

However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

21537065|t|Comparison of virulence markers and antibiotic resistance in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli isolated ten years apart in Tehran.
21537065|a|INTRODUCTION: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes diarrhoea by producing heat-labile (LT) or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins after colonizing the small intestine by means of colonization factors (CFs). Although detection of the toxins is sufficient for verification of ETEC isolates, toxin-positive strains may be further analyzed for the presence of CFs. Antibiotics may shorten the duration of diarrhoea caused by ETEC, but the rapid emergence of resistant strains limits their usefulness. METHODOLOGY: ETEC isolates collected 10 years apart were compared for the prevalence of toxin types, CFs and antibiotic resistance. DNA/DNA hybridization with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes was used for the detection of toxin types, and CF-typing was performed by DNA hybridization using DIG-labeled probes for cfaD and CS6 with slide agglutination. Disk diffusion was used to determine antibiotic resistance. The presence of class 1 integrons was detected by PCR. RESULTS: ST-positive isolates were the most prevalent among the isolates from 1988, but a significant shift towards LT-gene carriage was observed in the 1998 group. CFA/I and CFA/IV were the most common CF types within both groups. The most prevalent resistance patterns among these isolates were ACSTSXT followed by ASTSXT and ASSXT. CONCLUSION: Our study of the two groups of isolates showed that the rate of LT and ST gene carriage, as well as antibiotic resistance markers, has changed in the ten years separating the two bacterial populations. These variations show the importance of monitoring pathogenic bacteria to obtain a near realistic picture of the circulating bacterial pathogens.

17054793|t|Expression of the bile acid receptor FXR in Barrett's esophagus and enhancement of apoptosis by guggulsterone in vitro.
17054793|a|BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus, a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, is associated with reflux disease. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of bile acid receptors in the esophagus (normal, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma) and to investigate their possible function. RESULTS: the expression of the bile acid receptors FXR and VDR in esophageal biopsies from patients with a normal mucosa, esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus or adenocarcinoma (n = 6 per group) and in cell lines derived from Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, was assessed by real time Q-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The effect of guggulsterone, an antagonist of bile acid receptors, on apoptosis of Barrett's esophagus-derived cells was assessed morphologically, by flow cytometry and by measuring caspase 3 activity. The expression of FXR was increased in esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma compared to normal mucosa by a mean of 44, 84 and 16, respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed a weak expression in normal esophagus, a strong focal reactivity in Barrett's esophagus, and was negative in adenocarcinoma. VDR expression did not significantly differ between groups. In cell cultures, the expression of FXR was high in Barrett's esophagus-derived cells and almost undetectable in adenocarcinoma-derived cells, whereas VDR expression in these cell lines was not significantly different. In vitro treatment with guggulsterone was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells and of the caspase 3 activity. CONCLUSION: the bile acid receptor FXR is significantly overexpressed in Barrett's esophagus compared to normal mucosa, esophagitis and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The induction of apoptosis by guggulsterone in a Barrett's esophagus-derived cell line suggests that FXR may contribute to the regulation of apoptosis.

22177785|t|Near infrared active heptacyanine dyes with unique cancer-imaging and cytotoxic properties.
22177785|a|Three near-infrared fluorescent heptacarbocyanine dyes have been synthesized using a facile one-pot synthetic approach. The reaction methodology afforded a mixture of three symmetric and unsymmetric heptacyanines containing various N-indolenine substituents, a dicarbocyclic acid (DA), a monoester (ME), and a diester (DE). These compounds were isolated, purified, characterized and biologically investigated for tumor cell cytotoxicity and uptake selectivity. Using cell viability and in vitro proliferation assays, we found that the esterified dyes (monoester, ME and diester, DE) were selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells and spared normal fibroblast cells. Additionally, confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed selective uptake of these dyes in cancer cells, thus suggesting tumor cell targeting.

22432980|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare women's acceptance of misoprostol-only medical termination of pregnancy (TOP) with surgical TOP. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Termination of pregnancy clinics in New Delhi, Mumbai, Hanoi, Tbilisi, Trivandrum and Yerevan. POPULATION: Women requesting TOP, at 63 days of gestation or less, at study sites where both medical and surgical methods were available. METHODS: Serial surveys eliciting measures of women's satisfaction and acceptance of TOP method were administered. Data were analysed using cross-tabulation and logistic regression to determine if TOP method was predictive of acceptability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient acceptance. RESULTS: High acceptability of both surgical and misoprostol-only TOP. CONCLUSIONS: Where medical TOP with mifepristone is not available, misoprostol-only medical TOP is acceptable to women who have the choice between medical or surgical techniques.

10721900|t|Utilization of biotin in proliferating human lymphocytes.
10721900|a|Lymphocytes are part of the immune system and respond to antigenic stimulation with proliferation. We sought to determine whether mitogen-stimulated, proliferating lymphocytes increase the cellular uptake of biotin and, if so, to identify mechanisms that mediate the increase. Lymphocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood; proliferation of lymphocytes was induced by incubation with pokeweed lectin, concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin. Biotin uptake was quantitated by determination of [3H] uptake into the lymphocytes during incubation with [3H]biotin after establishing that [3H]biotin is not metabolized within the lymphocytes during the incubation period (<5%). Biotin uptake into proliferating lymphocytes increased to 278-722% of the control values for nonproliferating lymphocytes. Kinetic analysis of biotin transport provided evidence that the increase is mediated by an increased number of transporters on the cell surface rather than by an increase in transporter affinity. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, completely suppressed the mitogen-stimulated increase in biotin transport. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that proliferating lymphocytes increase biotin uptake by increasing the synthesis of new transporters. Biotin affinity and structural specificity were similar in proliferating and nonproliferating lymphocytes, suggesting that mitogens induced an increase in the number of the same transporter molecule that mediates transport in unstimulated lymphocytes. Mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes exhibited 2.5 times greater activities of biotin-dependent beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase compared with time 0 (at 72 h after addition of mitogen). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that proliferating lymphocytes increase biotin uptake at least in part to provide adequate coenzyme for biotin-dependent carboxylases.

12701623|t|Implication of Galpha i proteins and Src tyrosine kinases in endotoxin-induced signal transduction events and mediator production.
12701623|a|Previous studies have suggested that heterotrimeric G proteins and tyrosine kinases may be involved in lipopolysacchaide (LPS) signaling events. Signal transduction pathways activated by LPS we examined in human pomonocytic THP-l cells. We hypothesized that Gi proteins and Src tyrosine kinase differentially affect mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa(NF-kappaB) activation. Post-receptor coupling to Ga, proteins were examined using pertussis toxin (PTx),which inhibits Galpha i receptor-coupling. The involvement of the Src family of tyrosine kinases was examined using the selective Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor pyrazolopyrimidine-2 (PP2). Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with PTx attenuated LPS-induced activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase, and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TN-alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). Pretreatment with PP2 inhibited TNF-alpha and TxB2 production, but had no effect on p38 kinase or JNK signaling. Therefore, the Ga i-coupled signaling pathways and Src tyrosine kinase-coupled signaling pathways are necessary for LPS-induced TNF-alpha and TxB2 production, but differ in their effects on MAPK activation. Neither PTx nor PP2 inhibited LPS-induced activation of interleukin receptor activated kinase (IRAK) or inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB. However, PP2 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene construct in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, LPS induction of Src tyrosine kinases may be essential in downstream NF-kappaB tansactivation of genes following DNA binding. PTx had no effect on NF-kaapaB activation of the reporter construct. These data suggest upstream divergence in signaling through Galpha i,pathways leading to MAPK activation and other signaling events leading to IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kaapaB DNA binding.

12544793|t|The use of vicryl mesh in 200 porous orbital implants: a technique with few exposures.
12544793|a|PURPOSE: To report the results of a wrapping technique for porous orbital implants by using polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) mesh (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, U.S.A.). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 200 consecutive patients from one author's practice who received a polyglactin 910 mesh-wrapped porous orbital implant after enucleation or as a secondary implant between October 1, 1996, and April 15, 2001. We recorded potential problems that might be attributed to polyglactin 910 mesh both before pegging (excessive inflammatory response to the material, conjunctival thinning, and implant exposure) and after pegging (exposure of the implant around the sleeve, conjunctival thinning, and implant exposure other than adjacent to the peg). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two men and 78 women underwent placement of a polyglactin 910 mesh-wrapped porous orbital implant. The average age at the time of implantation was 48.9 years (range, 11 to 85 years). The average follow-up interval in the 200 patients was 19.4 months (range, 2 to 80 months). Thirteen of the 200 patients had less than 6 months of follow-up, leaving 187 patients with an average follow-up of 20.5 months (range, 6 to 80 months). There were 76 primary enucleations and 124 secondary orbital implants. Thirty-seven patients received a Bio-Eye hydroxyapatite implant (HA) (Integrated Orbital Implants, San Diego, Calif), 97 received a synthetic FCI hydroxyapatite implant (FCI, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France), and 66 received a Bioceramic implant (aluminum oxide-Al2O3) (FCI, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France). One hundred fourteen patients (57%) underwent peg placement. The average time to pegging was 9.9 months (range, 6 to 16 months). Before pegging, 4 of 187 patients (2.1%) had implant exposure. Three of these exposures followed secondary orbital implant placement (2 Bio-Eye HA, 1 synthetic FCI3 HA) and one followed an enucleation (synthetic FCI3 HA). Two patients required a temporalis fascia graft and one required a scleral patch; the remaining defect closed spontaneously. One patient had conjunctival thinning 6 months after orbital implantation, which remained stable with no frank exposure for 36 months. No patient had excess socket inflammation. After peg placement, 3 additional patients had exposure of the implant around the peg site. There were no cases of conjunctival thinning or exposure of the implant other than adjacent to the peg site. CONCLUSIONS: Polyglactin 910 mesh is an excellent option as a wrapping material for porous orbital implants. It is simple to use, readily available, eliminates the need for donor tissue, does not require a second operative site, and it is less expensive than other currently available wrapping materials. We attribute our high success rate to our technique, which emphasizes proper placement of the implant within the Tenon space, suturing the extraocular muscles anterior to their normal anatomic sites, and meticulous closure of the Tenon capsule and conjunctiva in separate layers.

9850131|t|Assessment of trans-fatty acid intake with a food frequency questionnaire and validation with adipose tissue levels of trans-fatty acids.
9850131|a|Past studies of the association of trans-fatty acid intake with coronary heart disease have been hindered by the lack of a database on the trans-fatty acid content of various foods. The authors used new data from the US Department of Agriculture to estimate trans-fatty acid intake using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and they assessed the validity of the FFQ by comparing the dietary estimates with trans-fatty acid concentrations in adipose tissue. The 1996 study included 27 women and 24 men aged 51-78 years. The mean consumption of total trans-fatty acids estimated from the FFQ was 2.24 g per day and 5% of total dietary fat. The mean concentration of total trans-fatty acids in buttock adipose tissue was 4.7% of total fatty acids. Pearson correlations between total dietary intake of trans-fatty acids and total trans-fatty acid levels in adipose tissue were 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.84) among men and 0.58 (95% CI 0.26-0.79) among women. After adjustment for energy intake, age, and body mass index, the correlation coefficients were 0.76 (95% CI 0.51-0.89) among men and 0.52 (95% CI 0.17-0.75) among women. The FFQ validated in this study is an important new tool for assessing usual intake of trans-fatty acids.

24812009|t|Human receptor activation by aroclor 1260, a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture.
24812009|a|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants, present in 100% of  U.S. adults and dose-dependently associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCBs are predicted to interact with receptors previously implicated in xenobiotic/energy metabolism and NAFLD. These receptors include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver-X-receptor (LXRa), and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). This study evaluates Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture with congener composition mimicking that of human adipose tissue, and selected congeners, as potential ligands for these receptors utilizing human hepatoma-derived (HepG2) and primate-derived (COS-1) cell lines, and primary human hepatocytes. Aroclor 1260 (20 µg/ml) activated AhR, and PCB 126, a minor component, was a potent inducer. Aroclor 1260 activated PXR in a simple concentration-dependent manner at concentrations >= 10 µg/ml. Among the congeners tested, PCBs 138, 149, 151, 174, 183, 187, and 196 activated PXR. Aroclor 1260 activated CAR2 and CAR3 variants at lower concentrations and antagonize CAR2 activation by the CAR agonist, CITCO, at higher concentrations (>= 20 µg/ml). Additionally, Aroclor 1260 induced CYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes. At subtoxic doses, Aroclor 1260 did not activate LXR or FXR and had no effect on LXR- or FXR-dependent induction by the agonists T0901317 or GW4064, respectively. Aroclor 1260 (20 µg/ml) suppressed PPARa activation by the agonist nafenopin, although none of the congeners tested demonstrated significant inhibition. The results suggest that Aroclor 1260 is a human AhR, PXR and CAR3 agonist, a mixed agonist/antagonist for CAR2, and an antagonist for human PPARa.

24384060|t|Transseptal access for left atrial ablation: the catheter-probing techniques are not without risk.
24384060|a|BACKGROUND: Transseptal puncture (TP) is a prerequisite for LA ablations. LA access can be gained by catheter probing in case of PFO (trans-PFO method) or puncture of the interatrial septum (IAS) using a transseptal needle. A 2nd access can again be gained via PFO, a 2nd TP or catheter probing of the previous puncture site (probe-TS method). This study investigates the risk factors and complications related to the mode of transseptal access. METHODS AND RESULTS: From August 2010 to August 2012, a total of 544 LA ablations, were performed. The mode of LA access was either a double TP or a single TP followed by the probe-TS or the trans-PFO method, respectively. TP was always guided by TEE and was successfully performed without complications in all cases. In contrast, 6/410 patients (1.5%) in whom catheter probing was performed (probe-TS, n = 4, trans-PFO, n = 2) had a dissection of the superior IAS originating from inside the oval fossa (n = 5) or perforation above the oval fossa (n = 1). Perforation into the pericardial space occurred in 4/6 patients, leading to one cardiac tamponade. In 5/6 patients, LA ablation was successfully completed, after repeated TP, despite effective anticoagulation. Patients with complications had the following characteristics: LA size 46  ± 4 mm, persistent AF (5/6), a repeat transseptal procedure (3/6) and a right-sided pouch (RSP, 5/6). CONCLUSIONS: Interatrial septum dissection/perforation, occasionally with perforation into the pericardial space, is an unreported complication of TP, especially with the catheter-probing techniques. An RSP is an unrecognized risk factor in this context and can be visualized by TEE.

23943252|t|NT-proBNP, a useful tool in hypertensive patients undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for primary aldosteronism.
23943252|a|Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension, but diagnostic tools for this disease still lack optimal accuracy. The heart is one important target tissue for damage due to excess aldosterone, and the role of natriuretic peptides is well recognized in diagnosing heart failure. We hypothesized that measuring the NT-proBNP could improve the diagnostic evaluation of PA. We enrolled 132 hypertensive patients, who underwent aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) screening, and 81 underwent an intravenous saline loading test (ivSLT) because of a high ARR. The NT-proBNP level positively correlated with the ARR and inversely correlated with the renin level. The NT-proBNP level was higher in patients with a high ARR than in those with a low ARR and higher in patients with a positive ivSLT than in those with a negative ivSLT. After logistic regression analysis, an NT-proBNP value above the median and male gender were predictors of a positive ivSLT. The proportion of patients with a positive ivSLT ranged from only 23 % in females with a low NT-proBNP to 93 % in males with a high NT-proBNP. NT-proBNP and gender are predictors of a positive PA confirmatory test. These findings highlight the possibility of using NT-proBNP to identify which patients with a high ARR should receive a complete PA diagnostic evaluation.

20337937|t|Antifungal activity of trichothecenes from Fusarium sp. against clinical isolates of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
20337937|a|Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a human mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, is a serious public health problem in several countries of Latin America. In our search we found that the crude extract of the endophytic fungus UFMGCB 551 was able to inhibit several clinical strains of P. brasiliensis, and was also active in the bioautographic assay against Cladosporium sphaerospermum. The endophytic fungus UFMGCB 551 was isolated from the plant Piptadenia adiantoides J.F. Macbr (Fabaceae). The fungus was identified as Fusarium sp. based on its macro- and micro-morphology, and on the sequence of the internally transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of its rRNA gene. The chromatographic fractionation of the fungal extract was guided by the bioautographic assay to afford three known trichothecene mycotoxins: T2-toxin (1) and a mixture of 8-n-butyrylneosolaniol (2) and 8-isobutyrylsolaniol (3). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the these compounds against eleven clinical strains of P. brasiliensis were evaluated and found to be in the range between 75 and 640 nmol l(-1) for 1 and 160-640 nmol l(-1) for the mixture of 2 and 3.

18194160|t|Analysis of pristinamycin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates in the Tunisian Bone Marrow Transplant Center.
18194160|a|AIMS: We report the analysis of genetic determinants conferring resistance to pristinamycin in Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and epidemiology typing of these strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis (346 isolates) were searched for strains with pristinamycin resistance. Pristinamycin-resistant strains (seven isolates) were isolated in five patients with haematological cancer in the Bone Marrow Transplant Centre of Tunisia in 2002. Resistance to pristinamycin was observed in 2% of isolates. The seven pristinamycin-resistant strains shared resistance to oxacillin (MIC = 8-512 microg ml(-1)), gentamicin (MIC = 16-512 microg ml(-1)), erythromycin (MIC > 1024 microg ml(-1)), lincomycin (MIC > 1024 microg ml(-1)), pristinamycin (MIC = 4-16 microg ml(-1)) and rifampin (MIC = 128-256 microg ml(-1)). erm genes were amplified: ermA from six strains and ermC from one. vga gene encoding streptogramins A resistance (pristinamycin rÃ©sistance) was amplified from all strains and typed as vgaA by analysis after electrophoresis of restriction profiles of vga amplicons (two fragments with Sau3A of 164 and 378 bp; one fragment with EcoRI). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI chromosomal DNA digests of the seven S. epidermidis isolates divided them into two distinct pattern types: pulsed-field type A (classified from A1 to A6 subtypes) and type B. The six strains harbouring ermA genes belonged to the PFGE type A while the strain harbouring ermC genes belonged to the PFGE type B. We characterized an epidemic strain carrying the vgaA and ermA genes responsible for the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Two clones of pristinamycin-resistant S. epidermidis were isolated in our patients. One of them, isolated in all patients, had expanded over six months suggesting acquisition by cross-contamination. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Increasing isolation of pristinamycin resistant S. epidermidis strains is an alarming indicator of nosocomial dissemination. The vector will be determined to establish a system of epidemiological surveillance.

17826020|t|Efficacy of nasal corticosteroids alone or combined with antihistamines or montelukast in treatment of allergic rhinitis.
17826020|a|OBJECTIVE: Topical corticosteroids are recommended as initial therapy in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. We investigated clinical efficacy of monotherapy with topical steroid and combined therapy in AR patients. METHODS: Ninety-five AR patients sensitive to grass pollens according to skin prick test results were enrolled in this placebo-controlled and open study. Patients were divided to four groups. Group-1 received only intranasal mometasone furoate (MF) 200microg (n=25), group-2 received intranasal MF and oral desloratadine (DLR) 5mg (n=25), group-3 received intranasal MF and oral montelukast (MSK) 10mg (n=25), group-4 received only placebo (n=20). Efficacy was assessed on the basis of total nasal symptom scores, rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire scores and nasal inspiratory peak flow rates. RESULTS: All groups that received treatment had better results when compared to the placebo group. Significant improvement in total nasal symptom scores was first evident at the end of the 2nd week in group-2. Group-3 had better results than those of the other groups at the end of the 1st month (p<0.05). Quality of life scores were significantly better in group-2 and -3 when compared to those in group-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Although corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in allergic rhinitis, montelukast may be considered as an additional agent especially in treatment of patients with impaired quality of life and it may be used to reduce nasal symptom scores.

11428667|t|Azo-containing urethane analogues for colonic drug delivery: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro evaluation.
11428667|a|A urethane-based analogue containing an azo aromatic linkage in the backbone was synthesized for use in colon-specific delivery systems by reacting toluene-2,6-diisocyanate with a mixture of an aromatic azo diol, (bis-4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,4'-diazobiphenyl, poly(ethylene glycol) (Mn = 4000; number-average molecular weight) and 1,2-propanediol (propylene glycol). The resultant compounds (UR-1 and UR-2) were characterized by IR spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, DSC studies, X-ray diffraction studies and molecular weight determination by gel permeation chromatography. The compounds exhibited low molecular weight, lacked film-forming properties and crystallinity in the structure. An in-vitro bacterial degradation test to demonstrate the susceptibility of azo bond to bacterial enzymes was performed using media inoculated with lactobacillus culture. The results indicated degradation of films by azoreductase. In-vitro permeation of 5-aminosalicylic acid was studied in control and lactobacilli-treated films. The permeability of the lactobacilli treated films was significantly increased suggesting the potential of these compounds for application in colonic targeting.

23349849|t|Flavonoids, flavonoid subclasses and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies.
23349849|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested the chemopreventive effects of flavonoids on carcinogenesis. Yet numbers of epidemiologic studies assessing dietary flavonoids and breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results. The association between flavonoids, flavonoid subclasses (flavonols, flavan-3-ols, etc.) and the risk of breast cancer lacks systematic analysis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association between flavonoids, each flavonoid subclass (except isoflavones) and the risk of breast cancer by conducting a meta-analysis. DESIGN: We searched for all relevant studies with a prospective cohort or case-control study design published before July 1(st), 2012, using Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PUBMED. Summary relative risks (RR) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. All analyses were performed using STATA version 10.0. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included, involving 9 513 cases and 181 906 controls, six of which were prospective cohort studies, and six were case-control studies. We calculated the summary RRs of breast cancer risk for the highest vs lowest categories of each flavonoid subclass respectively. The risk of breast cancer significantly decreased in women with high intake of flavonols (RR=0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98) and flavones (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.76-0.91) compared with that in those with low intake of flavonols and flavones. However, no significant association of flavan-3-ols (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.84-1.02), flavanones (summary RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.88-1.03), anthocyanins (summary RR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.87-1.08) or total flavonoids (summary RR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.12) intake with breast cancer risk was observed. Furthermore, summary RRs of 3 case-control studies stratified by menopausal status suggested flavonols, flavones or flavan-3-ols intake is associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal while not in pre-menopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests the intake of flavonols and flavones, but not other flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among post-menopausal women.

9041476|t|Platelet-activating factor and cardiac diseases: therapeutic potential for PAF inhibitors.
9041476|a|Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid mediator released from inflammatory cells in response to diverse immunologic and non-immunologic stimuli. Animal studies have implicated PAF as a major mediator involved in coronary artery constriction, modulation of myocardial contractility and the generation of arrhythmias which may bear on cardiac disorders such as ischemia, infarction and sudden cardiac death. PAF effects are induced by direct actions of PAF on cardiac tissue to modify chronotropic and inotropic activity, or indirectly via the release of eicosanoids such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), leukotrienes (LT) or cytokines (TNF alpha). The development of selective, high affinity PAF receptor antagonists has permitted investigations on the role of PAF in experimental animal models of cardiac injury. In vivo and in vitro studies strongly suggest that PAF receptor antagonists might convey therapeutic benefits in ischemic conditions and certain arrhythmias. In addition, PAF antagonists might have a cardiac allograft-preservation effect. Although clinical studies with PAF receptor antagonists in patients with cardiac diseases have not yet been reported, the experimental results to date suggest that PAF receptor antagonists might be useful in some specific cardiac disorders in humans.

23363077|t|Fluorinated N,N-dialkylaminostilbenes repress colon cancer by targeting methionine S-adenosyltransferase 2A.
23363077|a|Methionine S-adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) is the catalytic subunit for synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal methyl donor in many biological processes. MAT2A is up-regulated in many cancers, including liver cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) and is a potentially important drug target. We developed a family of fluorinated N,N-dialkylaminostilbene agents, called FIDAS agents, that inhibit the proliferation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Using a biotinylated FIDAS analogue, we identified the catalytic subunit of MAT2A as the direct and exclusive binding target of these FIDAS agents. MAT2B, an associated regulatory subunit of MAT2A, binds indirectly to FIDAS agents through its association with MAT2A. FIDAS agents inhibited MAT2A activity in SAM synthesis, and depletion of MAT2A by shRNAs inhibited CRC cell growth. A novel FIDAS agent delivered orally repressed CRC xenografts in athymic nude mice. These findings suggest that FIDAS analogues targeting MAT2A represent a family of novel and potentially useful agents for cancer treatment.

1498496|t|A case of linitis plastica of the rectum treated by pelvic exenteration after aggressive immunochemotherapy.
1498496|a|Multidisciplinary treatment was administered to a 32 year-old man with primary linitis plastica of the rectum, which was considered inoperable due to an extensive local spread at the first operation. Thirty KE of OK-432 was injected into the tumor per week (total 90-KE) and 5 KE of OK-432 was inoculated into the intracutaneous space per week (total 125 KE). Also methotrexete (MTX 50 mg) and 5-FU (500 mg) combined were given each week by intra-arterial infusion (total 20 courses). After this immuno-chemotherapy the CEA decreased from the pretreatment value of 12.7 ng/ml to 3.6 ng/ml and the tumor size was reduced. A total pelvic exenteration could then be performed almost curatively. As a result, this patient was able to return to the society with a better quality of life and has survived for 20 months since presentation.

18454048|t|Caspase-dependent cell death mediates potent cytotoxicity of sulfide derivatives of 9-anilinoacridine.
18454048|a|9-anilinoacridine contains a tricyclic and planar aromatic structure that enables DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Two recently developed sulfide derivatives of 9-anilinoacridines, 2-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)ethan-1-ol (CK0402) and 3-({4-[4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenylthio]phenyl}(3-hydroxypropyl)amino)propan-1-ol (CK0403), displayed potent cytotoxic activity in multiple cancer cell lines. In-vitro enzymatic assay demonstrated that CK0402 and CK0403 directly inhibit decatenation reaction of topoisomerase IIalpha. Cells exposed to CK0403 showed DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-2, indicating that it triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis. This was further supported by the fact that cytotoxicity of these drugs is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of caspases with z-VAD-FMK. Studies with wild-type and p53 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that p53 does not play a significant role in cell death process initiated by this kind of drug. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1activity moderately enhanced cytotoxic activity of sulfide 9-anilinoacridine, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 may have a protective function against 9-anilinoacridine-induced cell death process.

9914550|t|Selection of antibiotics after incision and drainage of peritonsillar abscesses.
9914550|a|Despite the fact that peritonsillar abscess is the most common complication of acute tonsillitis, the treatment of peritonsillar abscess remains controversial. One element of controversy is the choice of antibiotics after drainage of the abscess. In an attempt to assess the effect of antibiotic choice on the treatment of peritonsillar abscess, we conducted a retrospective review of records from patients with peritonsillar abscess treated with incision and drainage. Our review identified 103 patients, comprising two groups: 58 patients treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and 45 patients treated with intravenous penicillin alone. These patients were hospitalized after incision and drainage, and therefore their clinical courses and responses to therapy could be rigorously assessed. Characterization of illness based on patient age, temperature, and white blood cell count revealed similar severity of illness between the two groups. Comparison of clinical outcomes with respect to hours hospitalized (mean 44.3 +/- 6.6 and 38.3 +/- 7.1 hours, 95% confidence interval, for broad-spectrum and penicillin groups, respectively) and mean hours febrile (16.9 +/- 5.0 and 13.3 +/- 4.2 hours, 95% confidence interval) were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.222 and 0.269, respectively) between groups, indicating that broad-spectrum antibiotics failed to show greater efficacy than penicillin in the treatment of these patients. The microbiologic characteristics of these infections, failures of therapy, and complication rates were similar to those reported in the literature. These results suggest that intravenous penicillin remains an excellent choice for therapy in cases of peritonsillar abscess requiring parenteral antibiotics after drainage.

8142779|t|Diffusion hypoxia: another view.
8142779|a|Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was monitored postoperatively with pulse oximetry in 80 dental patients receiving nitrous oxide and oxygen. These patients were divided into four equal groups, three of which received nitrous oxide (N2O) and oxygen (O2) in ratios of 20:80, 40:60, and 60:40, respectively. The fourth group received 100% O2 and served as the control. The SaO2 was monitored for 15 minutes after termination of the procedure as the patient breathed room air. Continuous pulse oximetry revealed 43 episodes of SaO2 (a decrease greater than 3% from the baseline) in patients who received 20% N2O, 268 episodes in patients who received 40% N2O, 594 episodes in patients who received 60% N2O, and 21 episodes in patients who received 100% O2. The number of patients who experienced desaturation episodes increased with the increase in N2O concentration. The SaO2 values ranged from a decrease of 1.0% to 7.0% with a mean of 2.1%. Smokers experienced a greater number of desaturation episodes in the 40% N2O group and in the control group. One patient in the 40% N2O group experienced an SaO2 of less than 90%, but no patient experienced clinically significant hypoxia. In the 40% and 60% N2O groups, the percent change of SaO2 from the baseline was greater, and the SaO2 returned to baseline slower. The difference in mean SaO2 between smokers and nonsmokers was greater in the 40% N2O group.

20844001|t|Tumor suppressor action of liganded thyroid hormone receptor beta by direct repression of beta-catenin gene expression.
20844001|a|The abundance of b-catenin, which plays a critical role in oncogenesis, is tightly controlled by proteasomal pathways. Its aberrant accumulation is associated with the overactivation of its oncogenic signaling and tumorigenesis in cancers, including thyroid cancer. Our previous studies have suggested that b-catenin abundance could also be regulated at the transcriptional level by thyroid hormone (T(3)) and thyroid hormone receptor b (TRb). By using hypothyroid mice supplemented or not with T(3), we showed that T(3) significantly repressed Ctnnb1 expression in vivo in the thyroid. By using two human cell lines, i.e., the thyroid HTori and the cervical cancer HeLa cell lines, each stably expressing TRb, we observed that T(3) induced the down-regulation of CTNNB1 transcript levels. Luciferase reporter assays with various constructs harboring 5' deletion of the CTNNB1 promoter or with mutated thyroid hormone response element (TRE) binding sites, and EMSAs showed that this transrepression was mediated through an interaction between TRb-retinoid X receptor b complexes and TREs located in the human CTNNB1 promoter between -807 and -772 and consisting of two hexamers separated by 14 nucleotides. The direct regulation of CTNNB1 expression by TRb was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showing TRb recruitment to the CTNNB1 promoter in thyroid cells. This is the first report demonstrating a direct repression of the b-catenin gene by liganded TRb through interaction with negative TREs located in CTNNB1 promoter. Importantly, this study uncovers a new molecular mechanism whereby liganded TRb acts as a tumor suppressor via inhibition of the expression of a potent tumor promoter, the CTNNB1 gene.

19339107|t|NSC606985 induces apoptosis, exerts synergistic effects with cisplatin, and inhibits hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1alpha protein in human ovarian cancer cells.
19339107|a|The camptothecins, which target the intranuclear enzyme topoisomerase I, have advanced to the forefront of several areas of developmental chemotherapy of cancers. In the present study, we investigated the potential anti-human ovarian cancer effects of NSC606985, a novel and rarely studied camptothecin analog, and its combination with cisplatin (CDDP). Human ovarian cancer cell line COC1 cells were treated with different nanomolar of NSC606985 with or without CDDP, and cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated, respectively, by MTT assay and annexin-V assay on flow cytometry. Chou-Talalay analysis was used to evaluate combined effect of NSC606985 and CDDP. Western blot was used to detect protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), caspase-3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) proteins. Our results showed that NSC606985 at nanomolar concentration induced apoptosis with the activation of PKCdelta in COC1 cells. Especially, NSC606985 presented the significant combined effects on COC1 cells in terms of growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. In addition, NSC606985 significantly antagonized the accumulation of HIF-1alpha stabilized by hypoxia or hypoxia-mimetic agent. These results suggest that NSC606985 and its combination with CDDP present the therapeutic potential on ovarian cancer, and deserve further preclinical and clinical studies.

21431291|t|Successful treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF)-alpha of proteinuria in a patient with familial mediterranean fever (FMF) resistant to colchicine: anti-TNF drugs and FMF.
21431291|a|Familial mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever, peritonitis, pleuritis, and genetically by autosomal recessive inheritance. The major renal involvement in FMF is the occurrence of amyloidosis that can be prevented by a daily regimen of colchicine. About 5-10% of cases with familial mediterranean fever may be resistant to colchicine. In literature, there is a controversy about the treatment of FMF patients resistant to colchicine. We describe a case with FMF, proteinuria, and bilateral sacroiliitis, which responded to anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha therapy with infliximab and etanercept.

17618090|t|alpha-Tocopherol increases caspase-3 up-regulation and apoptosis by beta-carotene cleavage products in human neutrophils.
17618090|a|It has been found that beta-carotene cleavage products (CarCP), besides having mutagenic and toxic effects on mitochondria due to their prooxidative properties, also initiate spontaneous apoptosis of human neutrophils. Therefore, it was expected that antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol would inhibit the stimulation of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity by CarCP. However, we found that alpha-tocopherol increases caspase-3 up-regulation and stimulation of apoptosis of human neutrophils by CarCP. Ascorbic acid does not alter this caspase-3 up-regulating and proapoptotic effect exerted by alpha-tocopherol. Both alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid, in the absence of CarCP, decrease intracellular caspase-3 activity and spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils. Uric acid alone or in combination with CarCP does not exert apparent effects on caspase-3 activity and apoptosis. Up-regulating effect of alpha-tocopherol is not observed in the presence of retinol that markedly stimulates apoptosis by itself, whereas increase of caspase-3 activity is induced by concomitant addition of alpha-tocopherol and beta-ionone, a cyclohexenyl degradation product of beta-carotene with shorter aliphatic chain.

20099804|t|A capillary monolithic trypsin reactor for efficient protein digestion in online and offline coupling to ESI and MALDI mass spectrometry.
20099804|a|We describe the preparation of a capillary trypsin immobilized monolithic enzyme reactor (IMER) for a rapid and efficient digestion of proteins down to the femtomole level. Trypsin was immobilized on a poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol dimethycrylate) monolith using the glutaraldehyde technique. Digestion efficiencies of the IMER were evaluated using model proteins and protein mixtures as well as chemically cross-linked lysozyme regarding the addition of denaturants and increasing digestion temperature. The trypsin IMER described herein is applicable for the digestion of protein mixtures. Even at a 1000-fold molar excess of one protein, low-abundance proteins are readily identified, in combination with MS/MS analysis. An online setup of the IMER with reversed phase nano-HPLC separation and nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis was established. The great potential of the trypsin IMER for proteomics applications comprise short digestion times in the range of seconds to minutes, in addition to improved digestion efficiencies, compared to in-solution digestion.

20528617|t|Extracorporeal life support in a severe Taxus baccata poisoning.
20528617|a|INTRODUCTION: Yew (Taxus baccata) is a conifer known to be toxic since ancient times. Taxine A and taxine B, the toxic alkaloids of Taxus, block cardiac sodium and calcium channels causing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory distress, coma, seizures, and death in yew poisoning. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old male farmer was admitted to the hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction. First bradycardia and then ventricular tachycardia were present and a severe right ventricular dilatation with biventricular dysfunction was observed but with normal coronary arteriography. He was resistant to conventional therapy and, 6 h after hospital admission, extracorporeal support with membrane oxygenation was applied. The patient recovered. Nine days later, a large number of yew leaves were unexpectedly observed in his feces. Botanical and laboratory analysis confirmed the poisoning. Blood (651 ng/mL) and urinary (5.6 mcg/mL) levels of 3,5-dimethoxyphenol (metabolite of taxicatine) were greater than previously reported in lethal cases. The patient was transferred to a psychiatric unit 17 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive treatment of severe cardiovascular symptoms with antiarrhythmic drugs, temporary pacemaker, intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and extracorporeal life support can be life-saving even after a potentially lethal ingestion of T. baccata leaves.

10901361|t|Phase II study of S-1, a novel oral fluorophyrimidine derivative, in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. S-1 Cooperative Colorectal Carcinoma Study Group.
10901361|a|This study set out to evaluate, in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma, the efficacy and toxicity of S-1, which contains tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate, based on a biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) targeted at inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Sixty-three patients with measurable metastatic colorectal carcinoma were enrolled into the study. None of the patients had received prior chemotherapy except for adjuvant setting. S-1 was administered orally twice daily at a standard dose of 80 mg m(-2) day(-1) for 28 days followed by a 14-day rest. This agent is continued until disease progression, unaccepted toxicity, or patient refusal. Twenty-two (35%) of the 62 eligible patients achieved PR with a 95% confidence interval of 25-48%. Five of the 10 patients with a history of adjuvant chemotherapy achieved partial remission. The median survival time was 12 months. Major adverse reactions included myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal toxicities, though their incidence of grade 3 or 4 being 13% in neutropenia and less than 10% in the others. None of the 53 patients treated as outpatients required hospitalization due to adverse reactions: These results suggest that S-1 achieves similar responses to those of infusional 5-FU plus leucovorin and shows the potential of another biochemical modulation with easily manageable toxicity.

17262797|t|Does consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation improve the outcome of children with metastatic or relapsed Ewing sarcoma?
17262797|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation therapy for children with high-risk Ewing sarcoma (ES) treated at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of children treated for high-risk ES (defined as metastatic at diagnosis or relapsed) between 1990 and 2005 at SickKids were reviewed. Forty-five children were identified. Twenty patients received ASCT after induction with vincristine, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Patients with resectable tumor or lung metastases underwent surgery and those with non-resectable tumors were treated with irradiation. Twenty-five patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy (CC). Primary metastatic patients were treated with either a local protocol or as per POG 9354. At relapse, patients were treated with topotecan, cyclophosphamide, then ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE). Local control was attained with surgery and/or irradiation. RESULTS: Ten of the 20 patients treated with ASCT are alive (median follow-up 6 years), with 8/10 being in remission more than 5 years from diagnosis. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for ASCT was 59%, (95% CI: 36%, 81%) compared to 34% (14%, 53%) for patients treated with CC (P-value = 0.06). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) for the ASCT was 39% (17%, 60%) compared to 32% (13%, 50%) in the CC group (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: ASCT appears to add some benefit to conventional multimodality therapy for children with high-risk ES. Randomized controlled trials are warranted.

7992013|t|The changes in the myocardium under experimental conditions.
7992013|a|An effect of different interventions on the electron microscopic structure and morphometric parameters of the myocardium were studied. Application of cyclophosphamide and isoprenaline in the experimental animals allows the similar changes of mitochondrial partial volume like hypoxic periods of cardiac surgery by coronary bypass operation. Although the initial agents are different, the primary affected structures are sarcoplasm and mitochondria, whose proportions change promptly. The primary effect may be connected with alteration of membrane permeability caused by increased osmotic active ion transport on responsibility of the inhibited Na, K-ATP-ases (or F0 F1-ATP-ases irreversibly altered in mitochondria). The morphometric evaluation confirms not only statistically significant differences among the experimental groups treated by cyclophosphamide, isoprenaline and by cardioplegic ischaemic periods in the human myocardium but also by application of physiological saline in the control groups. Comparing the morphometric evaluation by manual processing with computer mediated image analysis we can conclude that the results correspond upon conditions of the specific defined raster for Weibel's intersection test only.

20020496|t|HIF-1alpha is an unfavorable determinant of relapse in gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy.
20020496|a|Among several chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used as a key drug in adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer. However, no reliable marker, which predicts the response to 5-FU in an adjuvant setting, has been identified. Hypoxia-induced drug resistance, via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, is a major obstacle in the development of effective cancer therapy. However, few clinical studies have so far assessed the relationship between the HIF-1alpha expression and the chemo-resistance of gastric cancer patients in an adjuvant setting. We established 2 HIF-1alpha knockdown gastric cancer cell lines in order to clarify the role of HIF-1alpha in chemo-resistance against 5-FU. Furthermore, expression of HIF-1alpha was immunohistochemically assessed in 91 resected specimens. Sixty-four of 91 patients received 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. HIF-1alpha expression was associated with the significantly shorter relapse-free survival and disease-specific survival in the 64 patients of adjuvant group (p = 0.026, 0.014, respectively), but not in the 27 of surgery group. Multivariate analysis showed that HIF-1alpha was an independent risk factor for relapse in 64 patients in the adjuvant group (p = 0.029). In conclusion, the current study confirmed, for the first time that HIF-1alpha expression is an independent risk factor for relapse in high-risk gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant 5-FU chemotherapy. A favorable effect of 5-FU might therefore be expected in patients that do not express HIF-1alpha, whereas, other types of chemotherapy or additional treatments, such as HIF-1alpha inhibitors, should be considered in patients that do express HIF-1alpha.

21901844|t|Experimental strategies for investigating psychostimulant drug actions and prefrontal cortical function in ADHD and related attention disorders.
21901844|a|Amphetamine-like psychostimulant drugs have been used for decades to treat a variety of clinical conditions. Methylphenidate (MPH)-Ritalin(R) , a compound that blocks reuptake of synaptically released norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in the brain, has been used for more than 30 years in low dose, long-term regimens to treat attention deficit-hyperactive disorder (ADHD) in juveniles, adolescents, and adults. Now, these agents are also becoming increasingly popular among healthy individuals from all walks of life (e.g., military, students) and age groups (teenagers thru senior citizens) to promote wakefulness and improve attention. Although there is agreement regarding the primary biochemical action of MPH, the physiological basis for its efficacy in normal individuals and ADHD patients is lacking. Study of the behavioral and physiological actions of clinically and behaviorally relevant doses of MPH in normal animals provides an opportunity to explore the role of catecholamine transmitters in prefrontal cortical function and attentional processes as they relate to normal operation of brain circuits and ADHD pathology. The goal of ongoing studies has been to: (1) assess the effects of low dose MPH on rodent performance in a well characterized sensory-guided sustained attention task, (2) examine the effects of the same low-dose chronic MPH administration on task-related discharge of prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons, and (3) investigate the effects of NE and DA on membrane response properties and synaptic transmission in identified subsets of PFC neurons. Combinations of these approaches can be used in adolescent, adult, and aged animals to identify the parameters of cell and neural circuit function that are regulated by MPH and to establish an overarching explanation of how MPH impacts PFC operations from cellular through behavioral functional domains.

20457578|t|Activation of wound healing in aged rats by altering the cellular mitogenic potential.
20457578|a|We previously showed that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (ACI) stimulate mitogenic activation of senescent human diploid fibroblasts. Because the modulation of cell proliferation may affect wound healing in aged organisms, we studied the effects of LPA and ACI on in vivo skin wound healing in aged Fisher 344 rats. We found that, in aged rats, wound healing improved in animals treated with LPA and/or ACI (relative to untreated controls), as assessed by histological analysis of reepithelialization and immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The age-dependent activation of mitogenic responses by LPA and ACI was confirmed in other cell types. Taken together, our findings suggest that the activation of mitogenic potential in senescent cells by LPA and/or ACI may translate into enhanced in vivo wound healing and tissue regeneration in aged animals.

17824463|t|Effect on free radical generation with different anaesthesia.
17824463|a|Reactive oxygen species are a part of the normal physiology of the biological system but their subsequent defence undergoes alteration during diseased conditions. Administration of anaesthesia for surgery may also alter the formation of reactive oxygen species. The present work deals with the comparative status of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) and anti-oxidant defence markers (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in blood in 3 groups of 15 patients each receiving halothane, relaxant vecuronium and spinal form of anaesthesia with lignocaine 5% heavy. The results obtained depict that the formation of malonyl dialdehyde as well as decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities was highest in spinal anaesthesia followed by halothane and then relaxant group. Therefore, it seems important to consider the pre-operative anti-oxidant status while administering anaesthesia to such patients in order to provide biologically safe anaesthesia.

9356086|t|Light versus heavy sedation after cardiac surgery: myocardial ischemia and the stress response. Maritime Heart Centre and Dalhousie University.
9356086|a|The influence of light versus heavy sedation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery on the development of postoperative myocardial ischemia has not been described. After uncomplicated CABG surgery, 50 patients were randomly assigned to receive LOW (n = 24; target Ramsay Sedation Score [RSS] = 2) or HIGH (n = 26; target RSS = 4) sedation with propofol. Analgesia was provided to maintain a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score <7. Myocardial ischemia was identified perioperatively using continuous 3-lead Holter monitoring. By measuring creatine kinase (CK) MB levels preoperatively, at entry to the intensive care unit (ICU), and every 12 h for 48 h; and by obtaining serial 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) (preoperatively; 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after ICU admission, 8:00 AM the morning after surgery; and 5 min pre- and postextubation), myocardial infarction was identified. Endocrine stress response was assessed by measuring serum cortisol levels preoperatively, on admission to the ICU, and 24 h postoperatively. In a subset of patients (LOW n = 10, HIGH n = 11), plasma and urinary catecholamine levels were also measured. There were no between-group differences in demographics, operative course, hemodynamic variables, or cortisol levels while in the ICU. The VAS pain score and target RSS were achieved and sustained, and they differed between groups. There were three myocardial infarctions in each group by CKMB criteria alone. No ECG-identifiable myocardial infarction occurred. The ST segment versus time curve (LOW 187 +/- 295 versus HIGH 1071 +/- 2137 mm/min) differed between groups. Urinary and plasma catecholamine levels were similar between groups over the observation period. We conclude that the use of a reduced sedation regimen in combination with adequate analgesia did not result in an increased endocrine stress response or risk of myocardial ischemia. IMPLICATIONS: This randomized study of patients after coronary artery bypass surgery examined whether light (versus heavy) sedation with propofol in the intensive care unit was associated with an increased degree of myocardial ischemia. Using techniques to detect myocardial ischemia, including Holter monitoring, electrocardiogram, and myocardial enzyme measurements, no differences were found. We conclude that light sedation does not increase the endocrine stress response or the risk of myocardial infarction.

15982187|t|Agonist-induced regulation of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum motility.
15982187|a|Using fluorescently tagged markers for organelles in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we have studied the effects of agonist-induced Ca2+ signals on the motility of mitochondria and the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). We observed that the muscarinic agonist carbachol produced a rapid, simultaneous and reversible cessation of the movements of both organelles, which was dependent on a rise in cytosolic Ca2+. This rise in Ca2+ was shown to cause a fall in cellular ATP levels, and the effect of carbachol on organelle movement could be mimicked by depleting ATP with metabolic inhibitors in the absence of any such rise in Ca2+. However, a Ca2+-sensing process independent of ATP appears also to be involved, because we identified conditions where the ATP depletion was blocked (by inhibitors of the Ca2+ pumps), but the organelle movements still ceased following a rise in cytosolic Ca2+. We conclude that the co-ordinated cessation of mitochondria and ER motility is a process regulated by the cytosolic concentration of both Ca2+ and ATP, and that these two parameters are likely to synergize to regulate the localization of the two organelles, and to facilitate the transfer of Ca2+ between them.

10559581|t|Effects of cyclosporin A on immune activation markers in patients with active psoriasis.
10559581|a|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease. The objective of this work was to investigate the presence of cellular and soluble activation molecules in the blood of patients with psoriasis, not responding to local treatment and to study the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) on these markers. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. The results were evaluated at baseline and at 15 days, 3, 6 and 12 months following initiation of treatment. RESULTS: We found increased baseline values of lymphocytes and cells expressing the marker CD3+CD25+, CD54+ (ICAM-1) and CD58+ (LFA-3). Following CsA treatment, a significant decrease in the percentage of activated T cells expressing CD3+CD25+ and CD3+HLA-DR+ was noted at 6 and 12 months. Among the soluble factors studied, increased baseline serum levels of sIL-2R, sCD23 and neopterin were observed. CsA significantly reduced the levels of sIL-2R and IL-12. CONCLUSION: Although there is evidence for systemic immune activation in psoriasis, sIL-2R is the most consistently increased activation marker, related to the Th1 immune response, that may be used as a marker for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment with CsA in psoriatic patients.

15172065|t|Occupational prolonged organic solvent exposure in shoemakers: brain MR spectroscopy findings.
15172065|a|Our purpose was to investigate, by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, the metabolite changes in the brains of subjects in the shoemaking industry who had been chronically exposed to organic solvents. A total of 49 male subjects and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers underwent detailed neurological and psychiatric examinations. All subjects had long-echo [repetition time (TR) 2000 ms, echo time (TE) 136 ms] single-voxel MR spectroscopy. Voxels (15 x 15 x 15 mm(3)) were placed in the parietal white matter, thalamus, and basal ganglia. N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho)/Cr ratios were calculated. There was no significant difference between the study subjects and the control group in NAA/Cr ratios obtained from thalamus, basal ganglia, and parietal white matter. Cho/Cr ratios in thalamus, basal ganglia, and parietal white matter were found to be significantly increased compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between basal ganglia Cho/Cr ratio and duration of exposure (r = 0.63). MR spectroscopy should be performed to reveal metabolite changes and determine the degree of brain involvement in solvent-related industry workers.

11339680|t|Recent chemical exposures and blood volatile organic compound levels in a large population-based sample.
11339680|a|Little is known about factors that influence blood levels of volatile organic compounds in nonoccupationally exposed populations. The authors examined the possible relationship between recent self-reported chemical exposures and elevated blood volatile organic compound levels among 982 adult participants in theThird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A strong dose-response effect was indicated (p < .001) for increasing lifetime pack-years of cigarettes smoked for elevated levels of toluene, styrene, and benzene. A positive dose-response effect was indicated for daily alcohol consumption with respect to elevated blood levels of 2-butanone and acetone. For volatile organic compounds typically found in 10-75% of the population, the establishment of a link with specific environmental exposures is relatively easy because there is less effect of confounding in this group. Some volatile organic compounds, however, are seen in less than 10% of the general population; finding these compounds at any level may warrant a search for a particular exposure.

20923857|t|Identification of predictive markers of response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) in K-ras-mutated colorectal cancer.
20923857|a|Mutant K-ras activity leads to the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in approximately 44% of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors. Accordingly, several inhibitors of the MEK pathway are under clinical evaluation in several malignancies including CRC. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize predictive biomarkers of response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 in CRC in order to maximize the clinical utility of this agent. Twenty-seven human CRC cell lines were exposed to AZD6244 and classified according to the IC(50) value as sensitive ( <= 0.1 µmol/L) or resistant (>1 µmol/L). All cell lines were subjected to immunoblotting for effector proteins, K-ras/BRAF mutation status, and baseline gene array analysis. Further testing was done in cell line xenografts and K-ras mutant CRC human explants models to develop a predictive genomic classifier for AZD6244. The most sensitive and resistant cell lines were subjected to differential gene array and pathway analyses. Members of the Wnt signaling pathway were highly overexpressed in cell lines resistant to AZD6244 and seem to be functionally involved in mediating resistance by shRNA knockdown studies. Baseline gene array data from CRC cell lines and xenografts were used to develop a k-top scoring pair (k-TSP) classifier, which predicted with 71% accuracy which of a test set of patient-derived K-ras mutant CRC explants would respond to AZD6244, providing the basis for a patient-selective clinical trial. These results also indicate that resistance to AZD6244 may be mediated, in part, by the upregulation of the Wnt pathway, suggesting potential rational combination partners for AZD6244 in CRC.

22183789|t|Therapeutic aerosol bioengineering of targeted, inhalable microparticle formulations to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb).
22183789|a|Therapeutic aerosol bioengineering (TAB) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) therapies using inhalable microparticles offers a unique opportunity to target drugs to the site of infection in the alveolar macrophages, thereby increasing dosing in the lungs and limiting systemic exposure to often toxic drugs. Previous work by us used sophisticated, high content analysis to design the optimal poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microparticle for delivery of drugs to alveolar macrophages. Herein, we applied this technology to three different anti-MTb drugs. These formulations were then tested for encapsulation efficiency, drug-release, in vitro killing against MTb and aerosol performance. Methods for encapsulating each of the drugs in the PLGA microparticles were successfully developed and found to be capable of controlling the release of the drug for up to 4 days. The efficacy of each of the encapsulated anti-MTb drugs was maintained and in some cases enhanced post-encapsulation. A method of processing these drug-loaded microparticles for inhalation using standard dry powder inhaler devices was successfully developed that enabled a very high respirable dose of the drug to be delivered from a simple dry powder inhaler device. Overall, TAB offers unique opportunities to more effectively treat MTb with many potential clinical and economic benefits resulting.

21770867|t|Enhanced chondrogenic differentiation potential of human gingival fibroblasts by spheroid formation on chitosan membranes.
21770867|a|Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were recently found to be a source of mesenchymal stem cells. Their behavior on a biomaterial has not been reported so far. The effect of culturing HGF on chitosan membranes on their chondrogenic differentiation was investigated in this study. HGF were first cultured on chitosan membranes and spheroid formation of HGF was observed. Next, HGF on chitosan were induced with chondrogenesis induction medium and their chondrogenic differentiation potential was expressed by assessing the expression of chondrogenesis related genes at both mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunostaining, respectively. We discovered that the chondrogenic differentiation potential of HGF could be enhanced simply by culturing HGF on chitosan membranes. Expression of neural crest and stemness genes were also analyzed by RT-PCR to evaluate the stemness and self-renewal of HGF spheroids. We found that spheroid formation helped to increase and maintain the expression of stemness genes in HGF. To understand the aspects of the chitosan membranes that induced spheroid formation of HGF, mechanical and physical properties of the chitosan membranes were examined. The migration of HGF on chitosan membranes was also monitored to speculate the process of spheroid formation. In addition, the roles of the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway and connexin 43 (Cx43) in spheroid formation were explored. Treatment of HGF cultured on chitosan with the ROCK-activity inhibitor Y27632 clearly inhibited spheroid formation, suggesting that the Rho/ROCK pathway was involved in spheroid formation. The increased Cx43 activity of HGF spheroids on chitosan indicated that the gap junction intercellular communication was regulated by spheroid formation. It was concluded that culturing HGF on chitosan may activate the Rho/ROCK pathway, which led to spheroid formation and gap junction regulation. These changes may contribute to the enhanced chondrogenic differentiation potential of HGF on chitosan.

18254068|t|Treatment for periodic paralysis.
18254068|a|BACKGROUND: Primary periodic paralyses are rare inherited muscle diseases characterised by episodes of flaccid weakness affecting one or more limbs, lasting several hours to several days, caused by mutations in skeletal muscle channel genes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to systematically review treatment of periodic paralyses. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to July 2007), and EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2007) and any other available international medical library sources from the University of Milan for randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised (including cross-over studies) and quasi-randomised trials in participants with primary periodic paralyses, in which any form of treatment, including physical therapy and alternative therapies, was compared to placebo or another treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our primary outcome measure was the change in attack severity or frequency by eight weeks from the start of treatment. Our secondary outcome measures were: change in muscle strength and mass; change in Quality of Life, using Short Form 36 (SF36) or similar; preference of treatment strategy; adverse effects at eight weeks. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies met our inclusion criteria. In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant. Fifteen preferred DCP, three placebo and six their baseline medication. Twenty-four of 31 participants with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases: for the 16 participants who had attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.006) and in severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.02) on DCP relative to placebo were significant. Fifteen preferred DCP, one placebo and five their baseline medication. Acetazolamide proved to improve muscle strength in eight participants with HypoPP in one other study and pinacidil, a potassium channel opener, also improved muscle strength in 2/4 participants with HypoPP in a third study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. The other two studies provide some evidence that either acetazolamide or pinacidil may improve muscle strength. However we still lack sufficient evidence to provide full guidelines for the treatment of people with periodic paralysis.

20849317|t|Image quality and attenuation values of multidetector CT coronary angiography using high iodine-concentration contrast material: a comparison of the use of iopromide 370 and iomeprol 400.
20849317|a|BACKGROUND: Effects of high iodine-concentration contrast material on the image quality of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have not been well evaluated. PURPOSE: To compare the image quality and attenuation values of CCTA between patients administered iopromide 370 and iomeprol 400 with the use of 64-slice multidetector CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled and were randomized into two groups (group A, 151 patients received iopromide 370, iodine flux = 1.48 g I/s; group B, 146 patients received iomeprol 400, iodine flux = 1.60 g I/s). CT attenuation was measured in the coronary arteries and great arteries and measurements were standardized based on an iodine flux of 1.50 g I/s. The image quality of 15 coronary artery segments was graded by two radiologists in consensus with the use of a four-point scale (1 = excellent to 4 = poor enhancement). Non-parametric statistical approaches were used to compare the two groups. RESULTS: The median attenuation values in the coronary arteries were 454 HU and 464 HU for iopromide 370 and iomeprol 400, respectively, and they did not differ (P = 0.26). When standardizing for an iodine flux, significantly higher attenuation values were found for iopromide 370 (median = 460 HU, range = 216  791 HU) compared with iomeprol 400 (median = 435 HU, range = 195  758 HU) (P = 0.006). The median image quality score of coronary arterial segments was 1 (range 1  2) for both groups (P = 0.84). CONCLUSION: The attenuation values in the coronary arteries after injection of the same amount of two high iodine-concentration contrast materials at the same flow rate with different iodine fluxes are similar with no difference in image quality. With standardization for an iodine flux, the attenuation is significantly higher when using iopromide 370.

8699848|t|Pentoxifylline: a potential treatment for thrombosis associated with abnormal tissue factor expression by monocytes and endothelial cells.
8699848|a|Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as the cell receptor for factor VII and activated factor VII (VIIa) and as the co-factor for VIIa. Because binding of factor VII/VIIa to its receptor is the first step in the activation of the coagulation process, TF is not normally expressed by circulating cells. Monocytes and endothelial cells are, however, capable of producing TF in response to diverse stimuli. TF expression is believed to be responsible for thrombotic complications associated with certain diseases. In vitro, pentoxifylline (PTX) inhibits monocyte production of TF in response to endotoxin, as well as endothelial cell production of TF in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In vivo, injection of PTX into primates prevents the activation of coagulation by endotoxin. The potential benefit of this treatment in patients with septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as in other clinical conditions in which TF expression is increased, remains to be determined in well-designed clinical trials.

19713529|t|MiR-128 up-regulation inhibits Reelin and DCX expression and reduces neuroblastoma cell motility and invasiveness.
19713529|a|MicroRNAs are a class of sophisticated regulators of gene expression, acting as post-transcriptional inhibitors that recognize their target mRNAs through base pairing with short regions along the 3'UTRs. Several microRNAs are tissue specific, suggesting a specialized role in tissue differentiation or maintenance, and quite a few are critically involved in tumorigenesis. We studied miR-128, a brain-enriched microRNA, in retinoic acid-differentiated neuroblastoma cells, and we found that this microRNA is up-regulated in treated cells, where it down-modulates the expression of two proteins involved in the migratory potential of neural cells: Reelin and DCX. Consistently, miR-128 ectopic overexpression suppressed Reelin and DCX, whereas the LNA antisense-mediated miR-128 knockdown caused the two proteins to increase. Ectopic miR-128 overexpression reduced neuroblastoma cell motility and invasiveness, and impaired cell growth. Finally, the analysis of a small series of primary human neuroblastomas showed an association between high levels of miR-128 expression and favorable features, such as favorable Shimada category or very young age at diagnosis. Thus, we provide evidence for a role for miR-128 in the molecular events modulating neuroblastoma progression and aggressiveness.

8852981|t|Donor-to-host transmission of Mycoplasma hominis in lung allograft recipients.
8852981|a|Mycoplasma hominis is a significant pathogen in immunocompromised hosts, particularly organ transplant recipients. We describe two recipients of lung allografts from the same donor who had M. hominis pleuropulmonary infection during the immediate postoperative period. The most likely source of infection in these cases was the donor's respiratory tract. The slow-growing pinpoint colonies formed by M. hominis on routine bacterial culture medium may be easily overlooked and should be subcultured to mycoplasmal medium for definitive identification. The recommended management of this infection consists of drainage and antimicrobial therapy with tetracycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone. This report highlights the potential for M. hominis to be transmitted from donor to recipient during organ transplantation.

8205537|t|Functional insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors are preferentially expressed in multiple myeloma cell lines as compared to B-lymphoblastoid cell lines.
8205537|a|While IGF-1 plays a role in early B-cell development, little is known of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) action in post-marrow B-cells. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that mouse and human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines possess functional insulin receptors (IRs) and IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1Rs). In this study, we show that responsiveness to insulin and IGF-1 is more developed in human MM cell lines than in human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Two human MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI 8226) were compared to three B-lymphoblastoid cell lines [Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B-cells (EBV), a Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Ramos), and a non-EBV lymphoblastoid cell line (HS Sultan)]. Surface IR and IGF-1R expression, measured by flow cytometry, demonstrated that the MM cell lines expressed more IRs and IGF-1Rs than did the EBV, Ramos, or HS Sultan cell lines. In vitro receptor kinase activity of affinity-purified receptors showed that the MM cells had more phosphorylated receptors than did the EBV, Ramos, or HS Sultan cells. Intracellular receptor signaling was also markedly different between the two cell groups. Whole cell phosphorylation studies showed that MM cells possessed not only hormone-dependent receptor autophosphorylation (M(r) 97,000) but also substrate phosphorylation (M(r) 185,000; 60,000). The lymphoblastoid cells, while demonstrating receptor autophosphorylation (IR autophosphorylation in the EBV cell line at 200 nM hormone was similar to MM receptor phosphorylation at 2 nM), lacked hormone-responsive substrates. The MM cell lines contained significantly more hormone-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity than the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. In the MM cells, PI 3-kinase was activated by at least 10-fold, but, in the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, it was activated by no more than 2-fold. Hormone-responsive glucose metabolism was also greater in the MM cell lines. In the U266 cells, insulin increased lactate production 62 +/- 9 and 101 +/- 12% (mean +/- SE) at concentrations of 2 nM and 200 nM, respectively. IGF-1 produced 72 +/- 9 and 99 +/- 13% increases at similar concentrations. In the 8226 cells, insulin increased lactate production 4 +/- 4 and 36 +/- 15% at 2 and 200 nM, respectively. IGF-1 produced a 13 +/- 6 and 70 +/- 18% increase. In the EBV and Ramos cells, neither hormone increased lactate production by more than 10 +/- 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

12063485|t|Allergic contact dermatitis in response to budesonide reactivated by inhalation of the allergen.
12063485|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 5% of patients with dermatitis who are consecutively patch tested are allergic to one or more corticosteroids. However, few reports of allergic mucosal and skin symptoms in patients with asthma and rhinitis caused by inhaled corticosteroids exist. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether inhalation of budesonide would result in reactivation of patch test reactions caused by budesonide. METHODS: The study, which was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, was ethically reviewed by the Medical Faculty, University of Lund, Sweden. Fifteen nonasthmatic patients who were initially given a diagnosis of budesonide hypersensitivity on patch testing from less than 1 up to 8 years before the study were provoked with budesonide or placebo by inhalation 6 weeks after they had been patch tested with budesonide, its R and S diastereomers, and potentially cross-reacting substances. Lung function was studied by using spirometry and repeated peak expiratory flow measurements. RESULTS: In 4 of 7 patients who inhaled budesonide, reactivation of previously positive patch test reactions was noted within 24 hours, in contrast to 0 of 8 patients who inhaled placebo (P =.026). No adverse pulmonary responses could be detected. CONCLUSION: This study shows that allergic skin reactions may occur in patients with contact allergy to budesonide when inhaled forms of the drug are used.

21034309|t|Herpetic necrotizing retinitis following flucinolone acetonide intravitreal implant.
21034309|a|PURPOSE: To report a case of herpes simplex virus-induced herpetic necrotizing retinitis after placement of a flucinolone acetonide (Retisert) intravitreal implant. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: A 22-year-old male with idiopathic unilateral panuveitis since 2002 that was intolerant of systemic immunosuppressive therapy received a flucinolone acetonide implant 6 years later. Intraocular inflammation was completely quiescent until 1 year following the implant, when he developed retinitis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of polymerase chain reaction-proven herpetic necrotizing retinitis following implantation of a Retisert device. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, herpetic necrotizing retinitis can occur in the setting of local ocular immunosuppression with the Retisert intravitreal implant. This potential infection should be considered in the face of recurrent uveitis following Retisert implantation.

11927178|t|Novel factor-based symptom scores in treatment resistant schizophrenia: implications for clinical trials.
11927178|a|To study the factor structure of symptoms in patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia and whether it is altered by treatment, we analyzed ratings on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) from two independent groups of patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia. With confirmatory factor analysis of pre-clozapine BPRS scores in 1074 patients in an administrative data base, the Clozapine Authorization and Monitoring Program (CAMP), we assessed the fit of published factor models and developed a better-fitting model. Model fit was validated in an independent group of 197 research unit participants. Stability of model fit six months post-clozapine was assessed in 834 CAMP patients. A new 4-factor model (negative symptoms, reality distortion, disorganization, and anxiety/depression) had better fit in both data sets than two commonly used factor models, and also fit better post-clozapine. We recommend these four factor scores as clinical trial outcomes in patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia.

1671651|t|Surrogate markers for survival in patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex treated with zidovudine.
1671651|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early effects of zidovudine treatment on CD4+ lymphocyte count and concentrations of beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, or HIV p24 antigen or antibody are correlated with survival in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. DESIGN: Retrospective study of changes in laboratory markers and survival. SETTING: Multicentre trial at university hospital clinics. SUBJECTS: 90 Patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. INTERVENTION: Patients started zidovudine 200 mg orally every four hours. Fifty six of the patients died a median 17 months after starting zidovudine; the remaining 34 patients were followed up for a median 25.5 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count and serum concentrations of p24 antigen and antibody, beta 2 microglobulin, and neopterin; survival of the patient. RESULTS: The pretreatment characteristics that independently predicted poor survival were determined using a multivariate proportional hazards model: a diagnosis of AIDS (v AIDS related complex), age over 45 years, and the logarithm of serum neopterin concentration. When these baseline characteristics were controlled for the logarithm of CD4+ lymphocyte count at weeks 8-12 of treatment (p = 0.007) and an increase in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration at weeks 8-12 (p = 0.05) also independently correlated with survival. In the 38 patients with a better pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival estimated by the product-limit method was 88% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers during early treatment compared with only 50% for those with a poor response on either marker. In the 38 with a worse pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival was estimated to be 49% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers compared with only 18% for those with a poor response on either. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CD4+ lymphocyte count at 8-12 weeks and, perhaps, change in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration could be surrogate end points for clinical outcome in trials of antiretroviral drugs for patients with HIV disease.

21078606|t|Review: Antiplatelet drugs: what comes next?
21078606|a|Antiplatelet drugs are important components in the management of atherothrombotic vascular disease. However, several limitations restrict the safety and efficacy of current antiplatelet therapy in clinical practice. Interpatient variability and resistance to aspirin and/or clopidogrel has spurred efforts for the development of novel agents. Indeed, several antiplatelet drugs are at various stages of evaluation; those at advanced stage of development are the focus of this review.

14659314|t|Are dopamine antagonists a risk factor for breast cancer? An answer from Parkinson's disease.
14659314|a|Women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer are often administered dopamine antagonist adjuvant medications that may increase levels of prolactin potentially increasing the risk of cancer. Using nationwide computerized registers of death data for the years 1991 through 1996 we examined 12,430,473 deaths of persons over 40 years of age and extracted 144,364 cases with Parkinson's disease (PD), a dopamine deficient population. Patients with PD had lower rates of breast and other types of malignancies, even in the presence of depression and suicide.

10791849|t|Relation between thymidylate synthase expression and survival in colon carcinoma, and determination of appropriate application of 5-fluorouracil by immunohistochemical method.
10791849|a|BACKGROUND: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is regarded as a parameter of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemosensitivity for colorectal carcinoma. Recent researchers indicate that the chemosensitivity of 5-FU for colorectal carcinoma with low expression of TS is better than tumors with high expression of TS. But the relation between TS expression and overall survival of curatively resected colorectal cancer patients has been less studied. METHODS: Specimens of curatively resected colon carcinoma from 148 patients were included in this study. TS expression in the tumor was assessed by immunohistochemical staining technique, and the patients were categorized into TS-(+) and TS-(-) groups. First, the relation between TS expression and survival of patients was examined. Next, for each group, we compared survival between the chemotherapy-(+) and the chemotherapy-(-) subgroup. RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly better in the TS-(-) group (n = 107) than in the TS-(+) group (n = 41) (P = .0003). In the TS-(-) group, there was little difference between the chemotherapy-(+) and the chemotherapy-(-) subgroup. In the TS-(+) group, the survival of the chemotherapy-(+) subgroup was significantly better than the chemotherapy-(-) subgroup (P = .0439). CONCLUSIONS: TS, itself, may be a prognostic factor for colon carcinoma; and 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy may be appropriate for colon carcinoma with high expression of TS.

23996795|t|The comparative efficacy of intramuscular antipsychotics for the management of acute agitation.
23996795|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the current role and comparative efficacy of short-acting intramuscular (IM) antipsychotics in the management of acute agitation, in current clinical practice. METHOD: The efficacy and tolerability of IM antipsychotics in the management of acute agitation in current clinical practice were reviewed in the Medline, PubMed, Cinahl Plus, Scopus-v.4 and PsycInfo databases. RESULTS: The comparative efficacy of the rapidly-acting IM atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole) is similar to that of the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol. IM olanzapine and ziprasidone were associated with fewer extrapyramidal side-effects and had similar cardiac tolerability to IM haloperidol. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required in the ongoing development of contemporary, evidence-based clinical guidelines in acute agitation, including head-to-head comparisons of currently utilized IM atypical antipsychotics, sequential treatment or combinations of medications.

1299490|t|Failure of magnesium supplementation to influence marathon running performance or recovery in magnesium-replete subjects.
1299490|a|This study examined the effect of magnesium supplementation on muscle magnesium content, on running performance during a 42-km marathon footrace, and on muscle damage and the rate of recovery of muscle function following the race. Twenty athletes were divided equally into two matched groups and were studied for 4 weeks before and 6 weeks after a marathon in a double-blind trial; the experimental group received magnesium supplement (365 mg per day) and the control group, placebo. Magnesium supplementation did not increase either muscle or serum magnesium concentrations and had no measurable effect on 42-km marathon running performance. Extra magnesium ingestion also had no influence on the extent of muscle damage or the rate of recovery of muscle function. The latter was significantly reduced immediately after the marathon but returned to normal within 1 week. Thus, magnesium supplementation in magnesium-replete subjects did not enhance performance or increase resistance to muscle damage during the race, or the rate of recovery of muscle function following the race.

10064003|t|Effects of diets enriched in lauric, palmitic or oleic acids on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.
10064003|a|In this study we compared the effects of specific saturated fatty acids (lauric acid and palmitic acid) with those of a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) on coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in healthy women and men. Eighteen women and fourteen men consumed, in random order, three experimental diets, each for six weeks. The diets consisted of solid foods and approximately 70% [28 percent of energy (En%)] of the fat calories was supplied. As determined from duplicate portions, in the lauric acid diet 7.3 En% and in the palmitic acid diet 6.1 En% of oleic acid were exchanged for lauric or palmitic acid, respectively. The lauric acid diet also contained some (average 1.8 En%) more myristic acid. Compared with the oleic acid diet, factor VIIam in the female subjects was 9% higher with the lauric acid diet (P = 0.0036; 95% CI, 3 to 14%) and 10% higher with the palmitic acid diet (P = 0.0011; 95% CI, 5 to 16%). Changes in men were not significant. Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI-1) activity was higher on the palmitic acid compared with the oleic acid diet (difference between diets of 2.3 U/ml; P = 0.0098; 95% CI, 0.4 to 4.3 U/ml) and the lauric acid diet (difference between diets of 2.2 U/ml; P = 0.0123; 95% CI, 0.2 to 4.1 U/ml). No significant differences between diets were observed for antithrombin III activity, fibrinogen concentrations, fragment 1+2 concentrations, plasminogen or alpha2-antiplasmin activity. From this study, we conclude that diets rich in lauric or palmitic acid, compared with a diet rich in oleic acid, unfavourably influence factor VIIam activity, in a gender specific manner. In addition, the plasminogen activator inhibiting capacity of the plasma is impaired with a palmitic acid rich diet compared with an oleic or lauric acid rich diet.

18673555|t|Experiences of a long-term randomized controlled prevention trial in a maiden environment: Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy trial.
18673555|a|BACKGROUND: Preventive drugs require long-term trials to show their effectiveness or harms and often a lot of changes occur during post-marketing studies. The purpose of this article is to describe the research process in a long-term randomized controlled trial and discuss the impact and consequences of changes in the research environment. METHODS: The Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy trial (EPHT), originally planned to continue for five years, was planned in co-operation with the Women's International Study of Long-Duration Oestrogen after Menopause (WISDOM) in the UK. In addition to health outcomes, EPHT was specifically designed to study the impact of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) on health services utilization. RESULTS: After EPHT recruited in 1999-2001 the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) in the USA decided to stop the estrogen-progestin trial after a mean of 5.2 years in July 2002 because of increased risk of breast cancer and later in 2004 the estrogen-only trial because HT increased the risk of stroke, decreased the risk of hip fracture, and did not affect coronary heart disease incidence. WISDOM was halted in autumn 2002. These decisions had a major influence on EPHT. CONCLUSION: Changes in Estonian society challenged EPHT to find a balance between the needs of achieving responses to the trial aims with a limited budget and simultaneously maintaining the safety of trial participants. Flexibility was the main key for success. Rapid changes are not limited only to transiting societies but are true also in developed countries and the risk must be included in planning all long-term trials. The role of ethical and data monitoring committees in situations with emerging new data from other studies needs specification. Longer funding for preventive trials and more flexibility in budgeting are mandatory. Who should prove the effectiveness of an (old) drug for a new preventive indication? In preventive drug trials companies may donate drugs but they take a financial risk, especially with licensed drugs. Public funding is crucial to avoid commercial biases.

23514835|t|Spontaneous clearance and treatment of acute hepatitis C infection in HIV-positive men with 48 weeks of interferon-alpha and ribavirin.
23514835|a|Acute hepatitis C infection in the context of HIV is an emerging problem in men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of MSM diagnosed with and treated for acute hepatitis C infection over 10 years. Genotype 1 was the commonest type representing 69% of cases; the spontaneous clearance rate was 20%. The overall sustained virological response (SVR) rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 83%; SVR and was 92% for those completing 48 weeks of treatment. The presence of detectable RNA at week 12 had a 100% negative predictive value for SVR. This is the largest single cohort treated with 48 weeks of interferon and ribavirin and the treatment SVR is one of the highest reported. We propose that a 48-week treatment regimen may be superior to shorter (24-week) regimens though we acknowledge the need for a randomized controlled trial.

20822372|t|Dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients: lack of association with clinical phenotypes.
20822372|a|OBJECTIVES: Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (Dysbindin) is a plausible candidate gene for major depressive disorders (MDD) due to its involvement in synaptic signaling, plasticity and localization in the brain. METHODS: Two intronic SNPs of DTNBP1; rs760761 (P1320) and rs2619522 (P1763) were analyzed in 206 patients with DSM-IV MDD to investigate the functional impact of genotypes on susceptibility for depression and some clinical phenotypes. The Sequenom iPLEX assay (Sequenom, Cambridge, MA) was used for genotyping. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited power of analysis, our results showed that these two SNPs in DTNPB1 gene were not related to clinical phenotypes such as melancholia, age at onset, suicidality and co-morbid anxiety disorders, as well as to treatment response phenotypes.

9605680|t|Metabolic changes during recovery in normothermic versus hypothermic patients undergoing surgery and receiving general anesthesia and epidural local anesthetic agents.
9605680|a|BACKGROUND: Mild hypothermia is accompanied by metabolic changes. Epidural local anesthetic agents attenuate the surgical stress response, but it is not known whether they modulate thermal stress. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing colorectal surgery, performed by one surgical team, received epidural 0.5% bupivacaine to achieve T3-S5 sensory block. They were then assigned randomly to two groups of 15 patients each. The control or unwarmed group was left to cool during surgery, whereas active warming was used in the warmed group. General anesthesia was induced by thiopentone, vecuronium, fentanyl, nitrous oxide in oxygen, and enflurane. At the end of surgery, both groups received epidural 0.25% bupivacaine to maintain a T5-L3 sensory block. Aural canal (core) and skin surface (15 sites) temperatures; oxygen consumption; pain visual analogue score; and concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucose, cortisol, lactate, and free fatty acids in plasma were measured before epidural blockade, 30 min after epidural blockade, at the end of surgery, and for 4 h after surgery. Patients and those measuring the outcomes were unaware of group allocation. RESULTS: Core and mean skin temperatures decreased significantly in the control group (P < 0.001) but not in the warmed group. Catecholamine concentrations in plasma decreased significantly after epidural block, and although concentration of epinephrine in plasma increased from baseline sharply in the control group at the end of surgery (P = 0.004), it decreased in the warmed group (P = 0.007). During recovery, there was no difference between the two groups for norepinephrine concentrations in plasma, body weight-adjusted oxygen consumption, pain visual analogue score, and metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative metabolic changes obtained with epidural block were similar except for an attenuated concentration of epinephrine in normothermic patients compared with those who were mildly hypothermic.

22729365|t|Prognostic implications of additional chromosome abnormalities among patients with de novo acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17).
22729365|a|This retrospective study performed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Southwest Oncology Group enrolled 140 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with t(15;17) to determine the influence of additional karyotypic abnormalities on treatment outcome. Karyotypes were centrally reviewed by both study groups. The complete response rate after induction for patients with t(15;17) treated with chemotherapy, or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as induction therapy was not affected by additional cytogenetic aberrations. Disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were unaffected by additional cytogenetic abnormalities if treatment was chemotherapy without ATRA. Patients with t(15;17) only, treated with ATRA with or without chemotherapy, had an improved DFS (P = 0.06) and a better OS (P = 0.01) compared with ATRA-treated patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients with APL and t(15;17) alone are significantly more sensitive to treatment with ATRA than are patients with t(15;17) and additional cytogenetic abnormalities.

20604763|t|Periodontal healing and bone regeneration in response to azithromycin.
20604763|a|Azithromycin, first synthesized in 1980, is a macrolide antibiotic related to erythromycin. It is widely used by the medical profession as a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections and tonsillitis. In addition to its antibiotic properties, azithromycin has immune-modulating effects and is used for this reason in the management of cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. The drug is taken up by neutrophils, macrophages and fibroblasts, and is slowly released by these cells. Three diverse case reports are presented in which a single course of azithromycin (consisting of one 500 mg tablet being taken a day for three days) was prescribed before any periodontal intervention occurred. Azithromycin was the principal mode of treatment of severe chronic and aggressive periodontitis in Cases 1 and 2. Azithromycin, together with monthly subgingival debridement, was the treatment in Case 3 (severe chronic periodontitis in a poorly controlled diabetic complicated by gingival overgrowth related to medication with a calcium channel blocker). Favourable resolution of inflammation, reduction in pocket depths and evidence of bone regeneration were evident, even when no periodontal treatment had occurred. In Case 3, resolution of gingival overgrowth occurred over eight months. The potential implications for periodontal management, understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and periodontal research are briefly discussed.

16675760|t|Pharmacological Treatment Patterns at Study Entry for the First 500 STEP-BD Participants.
16675760|a|OBJECTIVE: This study assessed patterns of psychopharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder. METHOD: Intake treatment data were examined for the first 500 patients in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study (1998 to 1999). Diagnoses were assessed by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV mood modules. Data on treatments were obtained by interviewing patients during the initial psychiatric examination. RESULTS: Of the 500 participants, 73.6 percent had bipolar I disorder, 23.0 percent had bipolar II disorder, and 3.4 percent had bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Upon examination, 63.4 percent were euthymic, 24.6 percent were depressed, and 12.0 percent were experiencing manic, hypomanic, or mixed states. Standard mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine) were the most commonly prescribed class of drugs that participants were taking at intake (71.9 percent). The next most common class of agents was antidepressants (40.6 percent), followed by novel anticonvulsants (31.8 percent), second-generation neuroleptics (27.2 percent), and benzodiazepines (25.0 percent). Eleven percent of patients were treated with standard mood stabilizer monotherapy. These prescribing patterns were further analyzed by subtype of illness and compared with patterns in other clinical and community settings. CONCLUSION: In a large, well-characterized cross-sectional analysis of prescription patterns in the U.S. psychiatric academic setting, patients with bipolar disorder were primarily treated with standard mood stabilizers, followed by moderate use of antidepressants, novel anticonvulsants, and second-generation neuroleptics. Results can be useful in understanding the current clinical standard of care, as well as in guiding research studies toward areas in which there is a relative absence of evidence to inform clinical practice. Studies of longitudinal prescribing patterns in bipolar disorder are also needed.

21821439|t|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and oral bleeding complications after invasive dental treatment.
21821439|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of oral bleeding complications after invasive dental procedures in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we included dental patients who had invasive dental treatment and were taking an SSRI medication. Data collected included demographics, medical history, dental visits and procedures, and use of adjunctive measures to control bleeding. Primary outcomes included documentation of return visits or phone calls to the dental clinic or emergency department (ED) for oral bleeding, and oral bleeding or use of blood products for inpatients. RESULTS: There were 92 patients taking SSRIs who had 145 invasive procedure visits, consisting of extractions, implant surgery, alveoloplasty, periodontal surgery, subgingival scaling and root planning, and biopsy. There were 110 extraction visits yielding a total of 167 extractions. Among all patients, there was 1 return visit to the clinic and 1 telephone call with a chief complaint of oral bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of oral bleeding complications after invasive dental treatment is low to negligible in patients on SSRI medications.

18720067|t|A randomized prospective study comparing medical and medical-surgical treatment of nasal polyposis by CT.
18720067|a|CONCLUSIONS: CT of the sinuses showed long-lasting improvement in the total and CT scores of the osteomeatal complex (OMC) after combined surgical and corticosteroid treatment as compared with medical treatment alone. However, the correlations between the improved CT scores and the patients' symptoms, olfactory thresholds or polyp scores were generally not significant. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate CT scans as a method for comparing the effect of medical treatment versus combined surgical and medical treatment of nasal polyposis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with nasal polyposis were randomized to unilateral endoscopic sinus surgery after pretreatment with oral prednisolone for 10 days and nasal budesonide bilaterally for 1 month. Postoperatively, they were given nasal steroids (budesonide) bilaterally for 1 year. They were assessed with nasal endoscopy, symptom scores, and olfactory thresholds and followed for 12 months. CT of the sinuses was performed before and 1 year after operation. The CT scans were evaluated using the Lund staging system. RESULTS: From before surgery to 1 year after surgery, we found a significant improvement on the operated side in the CT total scores, and scores of the OMC and the maxillary sinus, but no significant differences on the unoperated side. Significant correlations were also noted between the differences in olfactory thresholds between the operated and unoperated sides.

18164258|t|Up-regulation of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases is involved in ATRA and bufalin-induced cell adhesion but not cell differentiation.
18164258|a|The Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma (Cbl) family of ubiquitin ligases is multifunctional proteins that play important roles in different cell signaling pathways. It has been reported that c-Cbl and Cbl-b mRNAs are up-regulated during TPA-induced U937 and HL-60 cell differentiation. But the mechanism of the up-regulation and the roles of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases still remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that bufalin enhanced all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, accompanied by up-regulation of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases. CsA, an inhibitor of calcium mobilization, reversed this up-regulation. Pretreatment with CsA and PS-341 did not affect the expression of CD11b, but suppressed the percentage of adherent cells. Lipid raft localization of Cbl-b enhanced cell adhesion, while C-terminal deletion partially suppressed the effect. Moreover, the expression of the adhesion-related kinases Pyk2 and Paxillin was up-regulated in parallel with the increase of Cbl proteins. These results suggested that up-regulation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b was involved in the regulation of ATRA and bufalin-induced HL-60 cell adhesion rather than cell differentiation, which might be mediated by lipid raft localization, ubiquitin ligase activity and C-terminal structure of Cbl proteins. Meanwhile, up-regulation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and Paxillin might also be implicated in this regulation.

23154047|t|Detection of bla(OXA-23) in Acinetobacter spp. isolated from patients of a university hospital.
23154047|a|INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter spp. have emerged as notorious pathogens involved in healthcare-associated infections. Carbapenems are important antimicrobial agents for treating infections due to multidrug resistant Acinetobacter spp. Different mechanisms may confer resistance to these drugs in the genus, particularly production of class D carbapenemases. OXA-23-like family has been pointed out as one of the predominant carbapenamases among Acinetobacter. The present work aimed to investigate the occurrence of OXA-23-like carbapenemases among Acinetobacter isolates recovered from patients of a university hospital in NiterÃ³i, RJ, Brazil. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by disk-diffusion. Imipenem resistant isolates were submitted to Modified Hodge Test in order to screen for carbapenemase production, and later to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the presence of bla(OXA-23). RESULTS: Imipenem and meropenem resistance rates were 71.4% and 69.7%, respectively. The Modified Hodge Test revealed carbapenemase production among 76 (89.4%) of the 85 imipenem resistant isolates analyzed; according to PCR results, 81 isolates (95.4%) carried the bla(OXA-23) gene. CONCLUSIONS: OXA-23-like enzymes may be an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among isolates present in the hospital studied.

20628770|t|Effects of renin-angiotensin system blockade on the islet morphology and function in rats with long-term high-fat diet.
20628770|a|The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the endocrine pancreas. Multiple researches have shown that even in the insulin resistance phase, there are many abnormalities in islets morphology and function. This study aimed at investigating the effects of RAS blockade on the islets function in rats with long-term high-fat diet and its mechanisms. Wistar rats with 16-week high-fat diet were randomly divided into perindopril intervention group (FP, n = 15) and telmisartan intervention group (FT, n = 15). After 8-week intervention, insulin sensitivity and islets function were detected by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), respectively. The pancreases were stained by immunohistochemistry technique to qualitatively and/or quantitatively analyze the relative content of insulin (IRC), NF-KB, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and caspase-3 in islets. The apoptosis of islet cells was detected by TUNEL. The expression of angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1R), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1a and CHOP mRNA in the islets was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with normal control group (NC, n = 15), the glucose infusion rate (GIR), area under the insulin curve (AUCI) of 0-10 min and IRC were decreased in high-fat control group (FC, n = 15). The relative content of NF-KB, UCP-2 and caspase-3 was increased significantly with the increased number of apoptotic cells in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1b, HIF-1a and CHOP was also increased evidently (all P < 0.01). After intervention, the GIR, AUCI of 0-10 min and IRC were all increased obviously with the decreased relative concentration of NF-KB, UCP-2, caspase-3 and the number of apoptotic cell in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1b, HIF-1a and CHOP mRNA was reduced significantly (all P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups FP and FT. So we concluded that blockade of RAS may protect islet function of rats with long-term high-fat diet via downregulation of islets inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, which have tight relationship with each other.

19027573|t|Comparison of in vitro safety profiles of vancomycin and cefuroxime on human corneal endothelial cells for intracameral use.
19027573|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of cefuroxime and vancomycin on cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) to determine their safety for intracameral use. METHODS: Human corneal endothelial cells were harvested from human donor eyes and exposed to various concentrations of cefuroxime and vancomycin (0.15 to 15 mg/mL). For cytotoxicity testing, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was performed. Annexin V binding combined with propidium iodide (PI) co-staining was used for the distinction of viable, early, and late apoptotic cells. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals were calculated for the control group (without drug exposure) for 2.75 mg/mL and 15 mg/mL. Cell morphology and immunolocalization of zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) were assessed after 24 hours of drug exposure. RESULTS: Reduction in cell viability was observed in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to both drugs. Cefuroxime concentrations higher than 2.75 mg/mL and vancomycin concentrations higher than 5.0 mg/mL led to significant reduction in cell viability. The mean number of annexin V-positive and PI-positive cells was not significantly increased at 2.75 mg/mL for either antibiotic agent. After exposure to 15.0 mg/mL, however, the late apoptotic/necrotic cells predominated, with higher ORs indicating accelerated cell death. Increasing concentrations of both antibiotic agents resulted in fading immunopositivity for ZO1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a dose-dependent toxicity of cefuroxime and vancomycin on HCECs in vitro with a narrow range of safety. Although the clinically used concentrations seem to be safe, slightly higher concentrations might induce irreversible cell death and thus should be avoided.

9689432|t|Effects of branched-chain amino acid-enriched nutrient mixture on natural killer cell activity in viral cirrhosis.
9689432|a|A controlled study was performed in 18 viral cirrhosis patients to evaluate whether immune function, as indicated by natural killer (NK) cell activity, was improved by a branched-chain amino acid-enriched nutrient mixture (nutrient-mixture), Aminoleban EN. Five patients received the nutrient-mixture (100 g/day) for 2 to 6 weeks preceded by control periods. Five additional patients received the nutrient-mixture for 2 to 4 weeks, and the remaining 8 patients did not receive the nutrient-mixture. NK cell activity, CD16, CD8, CD11b, and amino acids were assayed before and after the administration of the drug in the nutrient-mixture-supplemented group, and two times with 1 to 6 month intervals in the control group. In the nutrient-mixture-supplemented group (n = 10), increasing NK cell activity, expressed as the ratio of values of post-treatment to that of baseline (ratio > 1.25) was detected in 7 (70%) patients, whereas in the control group (n = 13), it was detected in only 1 (7.7%) (p < 0.01). While in the affected group (NK cell activity ratio > 1.25, n = 7), all patients had compensated liver cirrhosis, in the unaffected group (NK cell activity ratio < 1.25, n = 3), 2 of 3 patients had decompensated liver cirrhosis (p < 0.02). Laboratory data, indicating severity of liver cirrhosis, such as total bilirubin and albumin, showed better values (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 respectively), and baseline NK cell activity was low (8.7 +/- 7.2% vs 33.3 +/- 13.0%, p < 0.05) in the affected group than unaffected group. NK cell subpopulations such as CD16 (%), CD11b (%) and one of the populations of T cell such as CD8 (%) showed no significant change throughout the study. As for amino acids analysis, Fischer's ratio was increased in the nutrient-mixture-supplemented group compared to the control group (p < 0.05), but none of the amino acids showed significant change. Thus the changes in NK cell activity were not explained by increase in NK cell subpopulations nor changes of amino acids. These results suggest that the branched-chain amino acid-enriched nutrient mixture increases NK cell activity moderately in patients who have compensated liver cirrhosis and shows lower values of baseline NK cell activity.

20345902|t|Effects of a novel arginine methyltransferase inhibitor on T-helper cell cytokine production.
20345902|a|The protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the guanidino nitrogen atom of peptidylarginine to form monomethylarginine or dimethylarginine. We created several less polar analogs of the specific PRMT inhibitor arginine methylation inhibitor-1, and one such compound was found to have improved PRMT inhibitory activity over the parent molecule. The newly identified PRMT inhibitor modulated T-helper-cell function and thus may serve as a lead for further inhibitors useful for the treatment of immune-mediated disease.

7869832|t|BW2258U89: a GRP receptor antagonist which inhibits small cell lung cancer growth.
7869832|a|The ability of reduced peptide bond analogues of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) to antagonize small cell lung cancer (SCLC) GRP receptors was investigated. BW462U89, BW1023U90, BW2123U89 and BW2258U89 inhibited binding of (125I-Tyr4) BN to NCI-H345 cells with IC50 values of 5, 6, 140 and 10 nM respectively. The GRP analogues had no effect on basal cytosolic Ca2+ but inhibited the increase caused by 10 nM BN. BW462U89 reversibly blocked the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by BN. The GRP analogues (1 microM) inhibited NCI-H345 colony formation in the absence or presence of 10 nM BN. Also, BW2258U89 (0.4 mg/kg, s.c. daily) inhibited xenograft growth in nude mice. These data indicate that BW2258U89 inhibits SCLC growth in vitro and in vivo.

11183845|t|Iron status in female endurance athletes and in non-athletes.
11183845|a|Iron status was studied in 126 female endurance athletes and 52 control subjects, all aged 16-20 years. The study aimed at identifying factors responsible for iron deficiency. Twenty-six percent of athletes and 50% of controls had latent iron-deficiency without anemia symptoms. A too low intake of iron (especially heme iron: 0.3 mg daily), and of nutrients influencing iron metabolism, were identified as main causes of iron deficiency in control subjects. In athletes, whose iron intake was sufficient (14.6 mg), the principal cause of iron deficiency were blood losses due to menstruation. High level of physical activity, expressed as training volume and experience, did not adversely affect iron stores, as these were higher than in control subjects and the incidence of iron deficiency was much lower than in the control group. It was concluded that an increased intake of iron and of dietary factors involved in iron metabolism prevented possible exercise-induced losses of iron in young athletes.

18070096|t|Simvastatin in the acute phase of ischemic stroke: a safety and efficacy pilot trial.
18070096|a|Although statins are being used for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, recent experimental data have shown new pleiotropic effects of these drugs responsible for their role in neuroprotection. We conducted a pilot, double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to study for the first time safety and efficacy of simvastatin in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Simvastatin/placebo was given at 3-12 h from symptom onset to 60 patients with cortical strokes. Efficacy on the evolution of several inflammation markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, C-reactive protein, sApo/Fas, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, E-selectin, L-selectin and nitrites+nitrates] and neurological outcome was evaluated at baseline, day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 90. No differences were found amongst the biomarkers studied regarding treatment allocation. Although simvastatin patients improved significantly by the third day (46.4% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.022), a non-significant increase in mortality and greater proportion of infections (odds ratio 2.4, confidence interval 1.06-5.4) in the simvastatin group were the main safety concerns. Therefore, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm the net benefit of this therapeutic approach.

15868618|t|Responsiveness of the SF-36 and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index in a systemic sclerosis clinical trial.
15868618|a|OBJECTIVE: This study compares the responsiveness to change of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), a measure of health related quality of life (HRQOL), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), a function instrument, in a randomized clinical trial for treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: A phase 2/3, multicenter, prospective, placebo controlled trial was conducted to evaluate human recombinant relaxin treatment in patients with diffuse SSc over 24 weeks. At baseline, subjects had stable, moderately severe, diffuse SSc of disease duration < or = 5 years, modified Rodnan skin score > or = 20, serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl, percentage forced vital capacity (% FVC) predicted > or = 50%, and % DLCO predicted > or = 40% and were not receiving concomitant disease modifying therapies. Internal consistency reliability of multi-item scales was estimated using Cronbach's alpha. Responsiveness to change of the SF-36 and HAQ-DI was computed between Weeks 0 and 24. Subjects were classified as unchanged or having a meaningful change in 4 different external measures: Change in (1) skin score > or = 30%; (2) % FVC predicted of > or = 15%; (3) self-reported patient global assessment by visual analog scale (VAS) > or = 20%; and (4) physician global assessment by VAS of > or = 20%. Responsiveness indices were computed and Cohen's effect size criteria were used to assess the magnitude of change. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients participated in this trial, with 196 completing the 24 week trial. Cronbach's alpha for the SF-36 scales ranged from 0.76 to 0.93 and for the HAQ-DI ranged from 0.69 to 0.91 (good to excellent). The SF-36 had a larger magnitude of responsiveness in overall disease (patient and physician global assessment) compared to the HAQ-DI, while the HAQ-DI had a larger magnitude of responsiveness in clinical measures (i.e., change in skin score and % FVC predicted) than the SF-36. CONCLUSION: These data support inclusion of both the SF-36 and HAQ-DI as outcome measures in future clinical trials of diffuse SSc.

16362716|t|Warfarin as a therapeutic option in the control of chronic cluster headache: a report of three cases.
16362716|a|Chronic cluster headache remains refractory to medical therapy in at least 30% of those who suffer from this condition. The lack of alternative medical therapies that are as effective as, or more effective than, lithium carbonate makes new therapies necessary for this highly disabling condition. Based on a previous report, we gave oral anticoagulants to three patients with chronic cluster headache. Two of them remained cluster headache-free while taking warfarin. In the third patient, the use of warfarin for three weeks initially increased the frequency and intensity of cluster headache attacks but subsequently induced a prolonged remission. In spite of the paucity of data available, oral anticoagulation appears to be a promising therapy for chronic cluster headache.

16254964|t|Predictive value of drug levels, HIV genotyping, and the genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) on response to saquinavir/ritonavir in antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected patients.
16254964|a|Plasma levels of HIV protease inhibitors (PI) are often close to IC50 values of wild-type viruses when administered without ritonavir boosting. The impact of drug levels, resistance mutations, and the genotypic inhibitory quotient (GIQ) were examined on the response to saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r)-based salvage therapy. Patients with prior exposure to PI other than SQV and currently failing virologically were recruited prospectively in a multicenter trial. All patients began SQV/r 1000/100 mg bid plus another two antiretrovirals. A total of 139 patients was enrolled. At month 12, virological response (VR), defined as plasma HIV-RNA decline >1 log, was recorded in 68.2% of patients on treatment (41.7% in the intent-to-treat analysis). The median baseline number of protease resistance mutations was three. The VR was significantly lower in patients with >5 protease resistance mutations and in those with plasma SQV Cmin<0.1 microg/ml. At week 48, the VR was seen in 77.1% of patients with a GIQ>0.04 compared to 18.2% of those with a lower GIQ (P=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, <or=5 protease resistance mutations and SQV Cmin>0.1 microg/ml were independently associated with VR. Interestingly, drug levels had their highest predictive value of the VR at week 12, since low SQV plasma levels often permitted ruling out poorly adherent patients. In contrast, the number of protease resistance mutations had the highest impact on the VR at week 24, suggesting that for those taking the drugs, the VR is highly dependent of the presence of resistance mutations. At any time, nevertheless, the GIQ provided the most accurate prediction of the VR.

17578949|t|Cardiopulmonary bypass, hemolysis, and nitroprusside-induced cyanide production.
17578949|a|BACKGROUND: Cyanide toxicity is a complication of sodium nitroprusside administration. Cardiac surgery may increase the risk of cyanide toxicity, because hemolysis during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may catalyze the release of free cyanide from sodium nitroprusside. METHODS: We obtained serial blood specimens from 25 cardiac surgical patients during CPB. Plasma specimens were analyzed for free hemoglobin concentration and ability to generate free cyanide anion upon exposure to sodium nitroprusside. RESULTS: Hemolysis based on plasma-free hemoglobin concentration increased over time during CPB at an average rate of 0.27 mg x dL(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.001). The concentration of free cyanide generated by the addition of sodium nitroprusside to the plasma samples was directly related to the plasma-free hemoglobin concentration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CPB-associated hemolysis and free hemoglobin release accelerated the immediate release of free cyanide from sodium nitroprusside. These in vitro findings suggest that cardiac surgical patients may be at increased risk of cyanide toxicity in response to the perioperative administration of sodium nitroprusside.

10489026|t|Evidence of interferon beta-1a dose response in relapsing-remitting MS: the OWIMS Study. The Once Weekly Interferon for MS Study Group.
10489026|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of interferon beta-1a, 22 microg or 44 microg weekly, with placebo in relapsing MS. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists concerning the optimal dose regimen for interferon beta in relapsing-remitting MS. Many patients and physicians prefer the convenience and lesser side effects of an injection given once weekly (qw) as opposed to three times weekly. Pharmacokinetic data and information on biologic markers suggest that this frequency may be suboptimal. METHODS: Randomized, double-blind study of interferon beta-1a 22 microg, 44 microg, or placebo administered by weekly subcutaneous injection for 48 weeks. Proton density (PD)/T2-weighted and T1-weighted-gadolinium MRI scans during 24 weeks of therapy were analyzed for the number of combined unique (CU) lesions (primary outcome). Biannual PD/T2 scans were analyzed for T2 activity and burden of disease (BOD). RESULTS: CU lesions at 24 weeks had a median of 0.71/scan with placebo, 0.5/scan with 22 microg (not significant), and 0.33/scan with 44 microg (p = 0.002). T2 new lesion count/scan (mean/median) at 48 weeks was 3.2/1.5 for placebo, 2.4/1.0 for 22 microg (p = 0.03), and 1.5/1.0 for 44 microg (p = 0.0005). BOD at 48 weeks showed a median increase of 5.9% for placebo compared with a decrease of 1.4% in the 44 microg group (p = 0.0058) and 2% in the 22 microg group (p = 0.0018). No clinical variable, apart from steroid use in the 44 microg qw group (p = 0.014), showed significance. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm an MRI benefit of interferon beta-1a at low dose in MS, but highlight the limited clinical effect. Taken together with other studies, the data demonstrate a dose-effect relationship for both clinical and MRI variables.

10831481|t|Differential efficacy of olanzapine for deficit and nondeficit negative symptoms in schizophrenia.
10831481|a|OBJECTIVE: Atypical antipsychotic medications have generally been found to be more effective than conventional antipsychotics in the treatment of negative symptoms. Whether the benefits derived from the atypical agents are the result of improvements in primary versus secondary negative symptoms is unclear. The authors examined the effects of olanzapine on primary and secondary negative symptoms for patients with severe negative symptoms who did or did not have the deficit syndrome. METHOD: Thirty-nine outpatients with schizophrenia and severe negative symptoms were assessed for the presence of the deficit syndrome and entered into a 12-week, open-label study of olanzapine. Positive and negative symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects, quality of life, and level of functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline and endpoint. RESULTS: All 39 patients completed the 12-week protocol; 13 of the patients had deficit negative symptoms, and 26 had nondeficit negative symptoms. Patients who had nondeficit negative symptoms demonstrated improvements in positive and negative symptoms, level of functioning, and extrapyramidal side effects over baseline. In contrast, patients meeting criteria for the deficit syndrome improved significantly over baseline only in extrapyramidal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that olanzapine is efficacious for secondary negative symptoms in schizophrenia but fail to support the contention that olanzapine has a direct beneficial effect on primary negative symptoms.

11561329|t|Managing hypothyroidism during pregnancy.
11561329|a|QUESTION: One of my pregnant patients is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. I prescribed her iron because she was anemic, but she continues to be weak and to have high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Increasing her dose of levothyroxine did not seem to affect her TSH levels. ANSWER: Many women need higher doses of levothyroxine during pregnancy. You should continue to monitor her TSH levels carefully and be aware that iron given during pregnancy might form an insoluble complex with thyroxine in the gestational tract.

23335849|t|Quinotrierixin inhibits proliferation of human retinal pigment epithelial cells.
23335849|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of quinotrierixin, a previously reported inhibitor of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), on cell proliferation and viability in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. METHODS: Subconfluent human RPE cells (ARPE-19) were exposed to quinotrierixin for 16-24 h. Cell proliferation was determined with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, hemocytometer counts, and CyQUANT NF Cell Proliferation Assay. Apoptosis was detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling assay. XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress response genes were determined in cells exposed to thapsigargin in the presence or absence of quinotrierixin. Overexpression of spliced XBP1 was achieved with adenovirus. RESULTS: Quinotrierixin reduced RPE cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without inducing apoptosis. In cells exposed to thapsigargin, quinotrierixin inhibited XBP1 mRNA splicing and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase activation, and reduced cellular and nuclear levels of spliced XBP1 and C/EBP homologous protein. Paradoxically, quinotrierixin exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2a, which in turn led to decreased protein translation. Overexpressing spliced XBP1 partially reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation by quinotrierixin. These results suggest that inhibiting XBP1 splicing contributes to quinotrierixin's negative effect on RPE cell proliferation, but other mechanisms such as reduction of protein translation are also involved. CONCLUSIONS: Quinotrierixin inhibits RPE cell proliferation and may be used as a novel antiproliferative drug for treating proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Future studies are needed to investigate the in vivo effect of quinotrierixin on RPE proliferation in animal models of proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

2373126|a|The acute effects of oral administration of felodipine 10 mg and nifedipine 10 mg on heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow and hepatic blood flow were studied in nine healthy men. Both drugs caused an increase in heart rate of 16 and 7 beats.min-1, respectively. Hepatic blood flow was significantly increased by 1.2 and 0.41.min-1 after felodipine and nifedipine. There was also a decrease in diastolic blood pressure, 10 and 5 mm Hg, respectively, after felodipine and nifedipine.

18060053|t|Functional ablation of pRb activates Cdk2 and causes antiestrogen resistance in human breast cancer cells.
18060053|a|Estrogens are required for the proliferation of hormone dependent breast cancer cells, making estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors amenable to endocrine therapies such as antiestrogens. However, resistance to these agents remains a significant cause of treatment failure. We previously demonstrated that inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family tumor suppressors causes antiestrogen resistance in MCF-7 cells, a widely studied model of estrogen responsive human breast cancers. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which pRb inactivation leads to antiestrogen resistance. Cdk4 and cdk2 are two key cell cycle regulators that can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, therefore we tested whether these kinases are required in cells lacking pRb function. pRb family members were inactivated in MCF-7 cells by expressing polyomavirus large tumor antigen (PyLT), and cdk activity was inhibited using the cdk inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p21(Waf1/Cip1). Cdk4 activity was no longer required in cells lacking functional pRb, while cdk2 activity was required for proliferation in both the presence and absence of pRb function. Using inducible PyLT cell lines, we further demonstrated that pRb inactivation leads to increased cyclin A expression, cdk2 activation and proliferation in antiestrogen arrested cells. These results demonstrate that antiestrogens do not inhibit cdk2 activity or proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the absence of pRb family function, and suggest that antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells resulting from pRb pathway inactivation would be susceptible to therapies that target cdk2.

12356386|t|Factors affecting low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to pravastatin in the West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS).
12356386|a|Statins are regarded as efficacious in general but there is a wide variation in individual response. We sought demographic and lifestyle factors that influenced the response to pravastatin 40 mg/day in moderately hypercholesterolemic men in the West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after 6 months of treatment were examined in 1,604 highly compliant subjects. LDL cholesterol decreased by a mean of 30.4%. The magnitude of the change was influenced, albeit to a small extent, by baseline plasma triglyceride levels and alcohol intake and age; subjects with low plasma triglyceride levels, older subjects, and subjects with low alcohol intake had the greatest reductions. The mean response in HDL cholesterol in the group was an 8.3% increase (0.09 mmol/L). The percent increase in HDL cholesterol was affected by baseline HDL level, plasma triglyceride levels, decrease in plasma triglyceride levels during the administration of pravastatin, and body mass index. The absolute increase in HDL cholesterol was influenced by the decrease in plasma triglyceride levels, body mass index, and alcohol intake. All of these associations were weak (r <0.2) although highly significant. In conclusion, plasma lipid phenotype, obesity, and alcohol consumption appear to influence the response of LDL and HDL cholesterol to statin treatment. The absolute increment in HDL cholesterol is relatively constant across a range of baseline values, hence the percent change is largely a function of the starting value.

8305734|t|Autonomous replication of human chromosomal DNA fragments in human cells.
8305734|a|We have examined whether a human chromosome has distinct segments that can replicate autonomously as extrachromosomal elements. Human 293S cells were transfected with a set of human chromosomal DNA fragments of 8-15 kilobase pairs that were cloned on an Escherichia coli plasmid vector. The transfected cells were subsequently cultured in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine during two cell generations, and several plasmid clones labeled in both of the daughter DNA strands were isolated. Efficiency of replication of these clones, as determined from the ratios of heavy-heavy and one-half of heavy-light molecules to total molecules recovered from density-labeled cells, was 9.4% per cell generation on the average. Replication efficiency of control clones excluded during the selection was about 2.2% and that of the vector plasmid alone was 0.3%. A representative clone p1W1 replicated in a semiconservative manner only one round during the S phase of the cell cycle. It replicated extrachromosomally without integration into chromosome. The human segment of the clone was composed of several subsegments that promoted autonomous replication at different efficiencies. Our results suggest that certain specific nucleotide sequences are involved in autonomous replication of human segments.

12975552|t|5- to 16-year follow-up following splenectomy in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in children.
12975552|a|The long-term outcome after splenectomy in children with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has not been widely analyzed. We reviewed the medical records of 288 children and adolescents with chronic ITP between 1980 and 1996: 112 were splenectomized; 59 were steroid resistant and 42 were steroid dependent, and 11 were managed with repeated courses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). All had platelet counts (PCs) <30 x 10(9)/l with frequent bleeding episodes or persistent thrombocytopenia <10 x 10(9)/l. Ninety-eight patients (88%) were evaluated; 58 (60%) patients had never received immunotherapy for ITP following splenectomy. At 5 years, 44 (45%) remained in complete response (CR) and 34 (35%) in partial response (PR). In multivariate analysis, steroid-resistant patients were more likely to relapse after an initial CR (RR 5.2). CONCLUSION: The long-term CR was 45%; 60% had stable PCs >30 x 10(9)/l not requiring therapy. Most postsplenectomy relapses occurred during the 1st year. Initial response to steroids and IVIG prior to splenectomy was a predictor of long-term response to splenectomy.

9848632|t|Safety and efficacy of total dose iron dextran administration in patients on home renal replacement therapies.
9848632|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous total dose iron (TDI) replacement in patients treated with home renal replacement therapy. DESIGN: Prospective open-label study on end points in the population studied. SETTING: Institutional outpatient home dialysis program. PATIENTS: The study included 20 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, performing chronic peritoneal or home hemodialysis, with iron deficiency defined as ferritin < 100 ng/mL and/or an iron saturation < 20%. INTERVENTION: The total dose of iron dextran was calculated and infused at a rate not exceeding 6 mg/min. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron studies, and liver function tests (LFTs) were obtained before and 3 to 4 weeks after TDI infusion. Hematocrit of patients failing to achieve an increase in Hct over this period was re-examined 2 to 4 weeks later looking for a delayed response. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end points for efficacy were changes in Hct, ferritin, and iron saturation. Toxicity was measured as reported immediate and delayed symptoms and elevated transaminases and/or alkaline phosphatase levels. RESULTS: A median iron dose of 1000 mg (range, 325-1500 mg) was administered. The infusions were generally well tolerated. Clinical adverse effects were seen in 2 patients weighing less than 50 kg. No increase in LFT results was seen. Hematocrit increased 2.2% (95% CI, 0.5%-3.9%) from 29.0% to 31.2% (p = 0.01) within 4 weeks of infusion. Significant increases also occurred in iron saturation (from 13% to 22%, p = 0.001) and ferritin (from 234 to 305 ng/mL, p = 0.008). Among the 9 patients who did not respond with a significant increase in Hct, 2 had a delayed response, increasing the overall response from 63% at 4 weeks to 71%, 8 weeks after TDI. Inadequate erythropoietin dosing and low-grade infectious/inflammatory disorders may have contributed to a poor response in several patients. CONCLUSION: Total dose iron is a safe and effective means of restoring iron and erythropoietic response in ESRD patients weighing more than 50 kg who receive their renal replacement therapy at home.

9297978|t|Kinetics of repair of UV-induced DNA damage in repair-proficient and -deficient cells as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
9297978|a|Advances in methodologies to monitor gene-specific repair in human cells have facilitated a detailed understanding of the complexity of the nucleotide excision repair system. One of these procedures, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), holds significant promise for dissecting the fine structure of the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. This assay was used to study the repair of UV photoproducts in both actively transcribed and nontranscribed genes from human cells that were capable of (1) repair of both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts; (2) removal of neither dimers nor 6-4 photoproducts; (3) strong preferential repair of 6-4 photoproducts relative to dimers; and (4) severely depressed rates of 6-4 photoproducts and dimers. Detailed kinetic analyses revealed that repair of both active and inactive genes can be studied with a very fine degree of precision and that the repair status of the cells can easily be detected by use of the procedures described.

12039092|t|Comparative examination of complaints of patients with breast-cancer with and without silicone implants.
12039092|a|OBJECTIVE: To measure the relationship between silicone breast implants and various symptoms using a control group. STUDY DESIGN: A matched-pair-analysis of 96 women with breast-cancer (32 with silicone implants (K I); 64 without implants (K II)) was performed with help of a standardized questionnaire in respect to 50 single criteria. The condition of implants was monitored by MR-imaging. RESULTS: Athralgias and myalgias were not significantly more frequent in K I. Only six symptoms were reported significantly more often in patients with implants. Positive correlation with implant rupture was given only for the numb feeling/tingling sensation in extremities (P=0.02). There was no correlation between silicone implants and the symptoms of the "chronic-fatigue syndrome" nor any other described silicone-induced disease. CONCLUSIONS: According to our analysis many of the symptoms examined here are present in middle-aged women regardless of silicone implants and underlying disease.

17064068|t|4-arylazo-3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazole CDK inhibitors: SAR study, crystal structure in complex with CDK2, selectivity, and cellular effects.
17064068|a|In a routine screening of our small-molecule compound collection we recently identified 4-arylazo-3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazoles as a novel group of ATP antagonists with moderate potency against CDK2-cyclin E. A preliminary SAR study based on 35 analogues suggests ways in which the pharmacophore could be further optimized, for example, via substitutions in the 4-aryl ring. Enzyme kinetics studies with the lead compound and X-ray crystallography of an inhibitor-CDK2 complex demonstrated that its mode of inhibition is competitive. Functional kinase assays confirmed the selectivity toward CDKs, with a preference for CDK9-cyclin T1. The most potent inhibitor, 4-[(3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl]phenol 31b (CAN508), reduced the frequency of S-phase cells of the cancer cell line HT-29 in antiproliferation assays. Further observed cellular effects included decreased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, inhibition of mRNA synthesis, and induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53, all of which are consistent with inhibition of CDK9.

9385388|t|Chemically-induced nasal carcinogenesis and epithelial cell proliferation: a brief review.
9385388|a|An increased rate of cell proliferation has long been recognized as an important factor in both human and experimental carcinogenesis, and may be a major risk factor for cancer development in a number of tissues. Limited information exists, however, regarding the relevance of increased cell proliferation and nasal cancer. Examples of toxicological studies utilizing nasal cell proliferation data as an important endpoint are briefly reviewed. Data for one of the most extensively studied chemicals, the weakly genotoxic carcinogen formaldehyde, support the contention that the concentration-response relationship for tumor incidence is a function of formaldehyde-induced target cell proliferation, in addition to other factors including target cell population size. The increasing importance of utilizing cell proliferation data in determining dose-response relationships and in biologically-based risk assessment models is discussed.

12670651|a|New dithiane or dithiolane derivatives of gossypol and gossypolone were synthesized with dithiolethane or dithiolpropane in the presence of BF(3)/Et(2)O. These thioderivatives exhibited low toxicity on KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cells of the mouth). They react easily with electrophiles in aprotic solvents to regenerate gossypolone or to form dehydrogossypoldithianes and dehydrogossypoldithiolanes, which display higher toxicity on KB cells. In addition, the low toxicity of gossypol thioderivatives was reversed by nitric oxide donors in physiological media. These experiments suggest that gossypol and gossypolone dithianes and dithiolanes can be used as prodrugs that target tumor cells surrounded by high concentrations of nitric oxide.

12748989|t|Carpobrotus edulis methanol extract inhibits the MDR efflux pumps, enhances killing of phagocytosed S. aureus and promotes immune modulation.
12748989|a|Although alkaloids from the family Aizoaceae have anticancer activity, species of this family have received little attention. Because these alkaloids also exhibit properties normally associated with compounds that have activity at the level of the plasma membrane, a methanol extract of Carpobrotus edulis, a common plant found along the Portuguese coast, was studied for properties normally associated with plasma membrane active compounds. The results of this study show that the extract is non-toxic at concentrations that inhibit a verapamil sensitive efflux pump of L5178 mouse T cell lymphoma cell line thereby rendering these multi-drug resistant cells susceptible to anticancer drugs. These non-toxic concentrations also prime THP-1 human monocyte-derived macrophages to kill ingested Staphylococcus aureus and to promote the release of lymphokines associated with cellular immune functions. The extract also induces the proliferation of THP-1 cells within 1 day of exposure to quantities normally associated with phytohaemagglutinin. The potential role of the compound(s) isolated from this plant in cancer biology is intriguing and is currently under investigation. It is supposed that the resistance modifier and immunomodulatory effect of this plant extract can be exploited in the experimental chemotherapy of cancer and bacterial or viral infections.

22682873|t|Autocrine regulation of y-irradiation-induced DNA damage response via extracellular nucleotides-mediated activation of P2Y6 and P2Y12 receptors.
22682873|a|A key component of the response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation is DNA repair. Release of extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP, from cells plays a role in signaling via P2 receptors. We show here that release of ATP, followed by activation of P2Y receptors, is involved in the response to y-irradiation-induced DNA damage. Formation of phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (yH2AX) foci, which are induced in nuclei by DNA damage and contribute to accumulation of DNA-repair factors, was increased at 1-3h after y-ray irradiation (2.0Gy) of human lung cancer A549 cells. Focus formation was suppressed by pre-treatment with the ecto-nucleotidase apyrase. Pre-treatment with ecto-nucleotidase inhibitor ARL67156 or post-treatment with ATP or UTP facilitated induction of yH2AX, indicating that extracellular nucleotides play a role in induction of yH2AX foci. Next, we examined the effect of P2 receptor inhibitors on activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; a protein kinase) and accumulation of 53BP1 (a DNA repair factor), both of which are important for DNA repair, at DNA damage sites. P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS2578, P2Y12 receptor antagonist clopidogrel, and P2X7 receptor antagonists A438079 and oxATP significantly inhibited these processes. Release of ATP was detected within 2.5min after irradiation, but was blocked by A438079. Activation of ATM and accumulation of 53BP1 were decreased in P2Y6 or P2Y12 receptor-knockdown cells. We conclude that autocrine/paracrine signaling through P2X7-dependent ATP release and activation of P2Y6 and P2Y12 receptors serves to amplify the cellular response to DNA damage caused by y-irradiation.

11758654|a|A high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of a neuroprotective agent for ischemia-reperfusion damage, KR-31378, in human plasma and urine and in rat tissue homogenates. The method involved deproteinization of the the biological samples with 0.5 volumes of saturated Ba(OH)2, 0.5 volumes of 0.04 M ZnSO4 and 1 volume of acetonitrile. A 80-microl aliqout of the supernatant was injected onto a reversed-phase C18 column. The mobile phase, 50 mM triethylamine acetate : acetonitrile : tetrahydrofuran (65:30:5, v/v/v), was run at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column effluent was mornitored by a ultraviolet detector set at 310 nm. The retention time of KR-31378 was approximately 6.5 min. The detection limits of KR-31378 in human plasma and urine and rat tissue homogenates were 0.2, 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. The coefficients of variation (within-day and between-day) were below 13.6% for human plasma and urine and rat homogenates. No interferences from endogenous substances were found.

15672555|t|Baseline plasma GABA: its relationship to the adverse effects of acute lorazepam administration on cognition in the elderly.
15672555|a|The GABA system is an active target for drugs to treat a variety of disorders and the availability of an indirect measure of central GABA activity would not only enhance psychiatric research, but also permit assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs designed to act on this system. The relationships between plasma baseline pre-drug GABA concentrations and cognitive impairments induced by an acute oral dose of lorazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg) were investigated in 22 healthy elderly individuals. Partial correlations controlling for plasma lorazepam concentrations revealed no significant relationship between baseline plasma GABA levels and lorazepam-induced impairments on tests of cognitive functioning. Plasma GABA concentration does not appear to be a useful marker of susceptibility to benzodiazepine-induced cognitive toxicity in the elderly. Other approaches to estimating central GABA activity should be pursued.

9562231|t|Nephrotoxic potential of antiinfective drugs as assessed by tissue-specific proteinuria of renal antigens.
9562231|a|In order to assess the nephrotoxic potential of antibiotics, various aminoglycosides and cephalosporins were tested for their potency to alter the excretion of tubular marker proteins (and brush border antigens) or to change the normal pattern of serumproteinuria as analyzed by SDS polyacrylamidgel gradient electrophoresis. After aminoglycosides, especially after gentamicin injection, a cumulative highly significant increase in the urinary output of marker proteins emerged (healthy volunteer model). In contrast, cephalosporins exhibited practically no nephrotoxic effect on proximal tubule cells. Excretion of tubular marker proteins was enhanced under combined administration of cephalosporins and aminoglycosides mainly due to the aminoglycoside component. There was no nephrotoxic synergy of both drugs. Image analysis of rat kidney sections after injection of aminoglycosides revealed that increased shedding of tubular membrane components under the toxic challenge is followed by rapid inductive repair processes (overshoot protein synthesis) of tubular cells. After a limited acute toxic damage tubular cells may recover within one week.

24850465|t|A fish-based diet intervention improves endothelial function in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover trial.
24850465|a|OBJECTIVE: The beneficial effects of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) consumption on atherosclerosis have been reported in numerous epidemiological studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of a fish-based diet intervention on endothelial function have not been investigated. Therefore, we studied these effects in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty-three postmenopausal women with T2DM were assigned to two four-week periods of either a fish-based diet (n-3 PUFAs  § 3.0 g/day) or a control diet in a randomized crossover design. Endothelial function was measured with reactive hyperemia using strain-gauge plethysmography and compared with the serum levels of fatty acids and their metabolites. Endothelial function was determined with peak forearm blood flow (Peak), duration of reactive hyperemia (Duration) and flow debt repayment (FDR). RESULTS: A fish-based dietary intervention improved Peak by 63.7%, Duration by 27.9% and FDR by 70.7%, compared to the control diet. Serum n-3 PUFA levels increased after the fish-based diet period and decreased after the control diet, compared with the baseline (1.49 vs. 0.97 vs. 1.19 mmol/l, p < 0.0001). There was no correlation between serum n-3 PUFA levels and endothelial function. An increased ratio of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid/dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid was observed after a fish-based diet intervention, possibly due to the inhibition of the activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase. CONCLUSIONS: A fish-based dietary intervention improves endothelial function in postmenopausal women with T2DM. Dissociation between the serum n-3 PUFA concentration and endothelial function suggests that the other factors may contribute to this phenomenon.

17122578|t|A multicenter clinical study of the safety and activity of maleimide-polyethylene glycol-modified Hemoglobin (Hemospan) in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.
17122578|a|BACKGROUND: Hemospan (Sangart Inc., San Diego, CA), a polyethylene glycol-modified hemoglobin with unique oxygen transport properties, has successfully completed a phase I trial in healthy volunteers. Because adverse events are expected to increase with age, the authors conducted a phase II safety study of Hemospan in elderly patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty during spinal anesthesia. METHODS: Ninety male and female patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, aged 50-89 yr, in six Swedish academic hospitals were randomly assigned to receive either 250 or 500 ml Hemospan or Ringer's acetate (30 patients/group) before induction of spinal anesthesia. Safety assessment included vital signs and Holter monitoring from infusion to 24 h, evaluation of laboratory values, and fluid balance. The hypothesis to be tested was that the incidence of adverse events would be no more frequent in patients who received Hemospan compared with standard of care (Ringer's acetate). RESULTS: Three serious adverse events were noted, none of which was deemed related to study treatment. Liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase increased transiently in patients in all three groups. There were no significant differences in electrocardiogram or Holter parameters, but there was a suggestion of more bradycardic events in the treated groups. Hypotension was less frequent in the treated patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with Ringer's acetate, Hemospan mildly elevates hepatic enzymes and lipase and is associated with less hypotension and more bradycardic events. The absence of a high frequency of serious adverse events suggests that further clinical trials should be undertaken.

12118861|t|Estimated and measured donor creatinine clearance are poor predictors of long-term renal graft function and survival.
12118861|a|The objective of this study was to evaluate estimated and measured donor renal function in predicting graft function long-term and to identify donor criteria associated with nonacceptable graft prognosis. In 200 consecutive cadaver donors creatinine clearance was measured at explantation and estimated using the Cockcroft formula on admission serum creatinine. Graft function was evaluated in recipients (n = 387) by 24-h creatinine clearance regularly during 3 years after transplantation. Measured creatinine clearance correlated to some extent with long-term graft function, while Cockcroft estimation was slightly superior and similar to using donor age only. Kidneys from donors with intra-operative creatinine clearance < or = 55 mL/min (median 50 mL/min) produced acceptable recipient graft function of 48 mL/min at 3 years and 76% 3-year graft survival. Donor age > or =60 years resulted in clearance at 3 years of 29 mL/min and 78% 3-year graft survival; adding the criteria of admission Cockcroft < or =60 mL/min, graft function at 3 years (28 mL/min) and 3-year graft survival (76%) were similar. In conclusion, creatinine-based estimates of the functional capacity of the donor kidney, calculated or intra-operatively measured, do little to improve the ability of donor age alone to predict long-term allograft function after renal transplantation, and nonacceptable donors are not discriminated.

18832858|t|Choosing a right surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome treatment.
18832858|a|Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common cause of respiratory insufficiency in preterm infants, especially those born at <30 weeks of gestation. Continuous positive airway pressure has been used since the 1970s as a primary mode of treatment for RDS. Surfactant therapy became available in the 1980s and has become the standard care for infants with or at risk for RDS. Surfactant therapy has been shown to decrease air leaks, neonatal and infant mortality as well as cost among survivors. Natural surfactants derived from animal sources containing surfactant proteins B (SP-B) and C (SP-C) as well as synthetic surfactants with functional SP-B- or SP-C-like protein mimics have been extensively evaluated in preterm neonates with or at risk for RDS. Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that treatment with natural surfactants results in faster weaning of supplemental oxygen and mean airway pressure, decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, and decreased mortality when compared to synthetic surfactants. Furthermore, at the present time, there are no approved synthetic surfactants available for use in preterm infants. Beractant, calfactant and poractant alpha are the three commonly used natural surfactants worldwide. Comparative studies including prospective randomized trials as well as large retrospective studies have shown significant differences in outcome and cost among these three natural surfactants. Of the eight prospective, randomized controlled trials and two retrospective studies involving the natural surfactant preparations, treatment with poractant alpha resulted in a significantly decreased mortality, decreased need for additional doses, faster weaning of oxygen and reduced hospital costs when compared to treatment with beractant or calfactant. These differences in outcome may be due to differences in phospholipid and SP-B content, amount of antioxidant phospholipids, plasmalogens, anti-inflammatory properties and viscosity among these three surfactants. Additional studies of administering surfactant non-invasively via laryngeal mask airway in preterm infants weighing >1,200 g and as an aerosol preparation are currently in progress.

20806262|t|Artificial neural network-based drug design for diabetes mellitus using flavonoids.
20806262|a|Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease involving the failure to regulate glucose blood levels in the body and has been linked with numerous detrimental complications. Studies have shown that these complications can be linked to the activities of aldose reductase (AR), an enzyme of the polyol pathway. Flavonoids have been identified as good AR inhibitors (ARIs) and are also strong antioxidants with radical scavenging (RS) activity. As such, flavonoids show potential to become a better class of ARIs because they are able to concurrently address the oxidative stress issue. In this article, we carried out quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of flavones and flavonols (members of flavonoid family) using artificial neural networks. Three computer experiments were conducted to study the influence of hydrogen (H), hydroxyl (-OH), and methoxyl (-CH(3)) functional groups on eight substitution sites of the lead flavone molecule and to predict potential ARIs. Of 6561 possible flavones and flavonols, in experiment 1, we predicted 69 potent ARIs, and in experiment 2, we predicted 346 compounds with strong RS activity. In experiment 3, we combined these results to find overlapping compounds with both strong AR inhibition and RS activity and we are able to predict 10 potent compounds with strong AR inhibition (IC(50) < 0.3 µM) and RS activity (IC(25) < 1.0 µM). These 10 compounds show promise of being good therapeutic agents in the prevention of diabetic complications and is suggested to undergo further wet bench experimentation to prove their potency.

19704071|t|Influence of melanosome dynamics on melanoma drug sensitivity.
19704071|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant melanomas are intrinsically resistant to many conventional treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, for reasons that are poorly understood. Here we propose and test a model that explains drug resistance or sensitivity in terms of melanosome dynamics. METHODS: The growth and sensitivity to cisplatin of MNT-1 cells, which are melanotic and enriched with mature stage III and IV melanosomes, and SK-MEL-28 cells, which have only immature stage I and II melanosomes, were compared using clonogenic assays. Differences in pigmentation, melanosome stages, melanosome number, and cellular structures in different cell lines in response to various treatments were examined by electron microscopy. The relative numbers of melanosomes of different stages were compared after treatment with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea. The relationship between drug transporter function and endogenous melanogenic toxicity was assessed by treating cells with the cyclosporin analog PSC-833 and by assessing vacuole formation and cell growth inhibition. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Endogenous melanogenic cytotoxicity, produced by damaged melanosomes, resulted in pronounced cell growth inhibition in MNT-1 cells compared with amelanotic SK-MEL-28 cells. The sensitivity to CDDP of MNT-1 cells was 3.8-fold higher than that of SK-MEL-28 cells (mean IC(50) for SK-MEL-28 and MNT-1 = 2.13 microM and 0.56 microM, respectively; difference = 1.57 microM, 95% confidence interval = 1.45 to 1.69; P = .0017). After treatment with 6.7 microM CDDP for 72 hours, the number of stage II-III melanosomes in surviving MNT-1 cells was 6.8-fold that of untreated cells. Modulation of MNT-1 cells to earlier-stage (II, II-III, III) melanosomes by treatment with the tyrosinase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-thiourea dramatically increased CDDP resistance. Furthermore, PSC-833 principally suppressed MNT-1 melanotic cell growth via an elevation of autophagosome-like vacuolar structures, possibly by inhibiting melanosome membrane transporters. CONCLUSIONS: Melanosome dynamics (including their biogenesis, density, status, and structural integrity) regulate the drug resistance of melanoma cells. Manipulation of melanosome functions may be an effective way to enhance the therapeutic activity of anticancer drugs against melanoma.

8073456|t|Differential effect of three cyclooxygenase inhibitors on human cerebral blood flow velocity and carbon dioxide reactivity.
8073456|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prostaglandins are believed to play an important role in maintenance of cerebral blood flow and possibly in the vasodilatory response to carbon dioxide. Therefore, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin, which inhibit cyclooxygenase, might be expected to reduce cerebral blood flow and the response to hypercapnia. This could induce cerebral ischemia in patients with a hemodynamically critical circulation. It would also interfere with the measurement of cerebrovascular reserve using carbon dioxide. METHODS: The effect of a single dose of indomethacin and of two other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin and sulindac) on the cerebral circulation was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral artery. Seven normal adults were studied in each drug group. Resting blood flow velocity and the responses to hypercapnia and to hyperventilation were measured. RESULTS: Indomethacin resulted in a fall in basal middle cerebral artery flow velocity from a mean of 48.9 cm/s to 34.0 cm/s (P < .002). It also reduced the vasoconstrictor response to hypocapnia (induced by hyperventilation) from 37.5% to 20.7% (P < .003). There was a nonsignificant reduction in the vasodilatory response to 8% carbon dioxide (mean: predrug, 87.7%; postdrug, 61.0%), with marked intersubject variability. In contrast, basal middle cerebral artery velocity and vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory responses to changes in carbon dioxide were unchanged after aspirin or sulindac administration. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of effect of aspirin on basal cerebral blood flow velocity and on vasodilatory reserve is reassuring; aspirin will not reduce cerebral blood flow or the response to a reduced perfusion pressure in patients with critically impaired cerebral hemodynamics. However, indomethacin should be avoided in such patients.

22542152|t|Gastrointestinal lesions and complications of low-dose aspirin in the gastrointestinal tract.
22542152|a|Low dose aspirin (ASA) use has been associated with a wide range of adverse side effects in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which range from troublesome symptoms without mucosal lesions to more serious toxicity, including ulcers, GI bleeding, perforation and even death. Upper GI symptoms in low dose ASA users are common but often careless or misinterpreted and they are not always related to the presence of mucosal injury. Usually, low dose ASA related ulcers are reasonably small and asymptomatic, and probably heal over a period of weeks to a few months. But, the real clinical problem occurs when the ulcer results in a GI complication (mostly bleeding). The estimated average excess risk of symptomatic or complicated ulcer related to low dose ASA is five cases per 1000 ASA users per year. Death is the worst outcome of GI complications in low dose ASA users, but data about this aspect are scarce. Current evidence indicates that low dose ASA can damage the lower GI tract also, but the real size of the problem is still unknown.

1311763|t|3,4-Dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones as combined inhibitors of thromboxane A2 synthase and cAMP phosphodiesterase.
1311763|a|A series of 1H-imidazol-1-yl- and 3-pyridyl-substituted 3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-ones was designed and synthesized as combined inhibitors of thromboxane (TXA2) synthase and cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in human blood platelets. A number of structures, e.g. 4b, 7a, 7e, 13a, and 21-25, were superior to dazoxiben 26 as inhibitors of TXA2 synthase in in vitro ADP-induced aggregation experiments with human blood platelets. The TXA2 synthase inhibitory activity was confirmed by measurement of the prostanoid metabolites derived from 14C-labeled arachidonic acid. Three compounds (7a, 7e, and 25) demonstrated in vitro inhibition of human platelet cAMP PDE at micromolar concentrations in conjunction with their TXA2 synthase inhibitory activity. Synergistic enhancement of antiaggregatory and antithrombotic actions was expected when simultaneous stimulation of adenylate cyclase (through increased PGI2 production) and inhibition of platelet cAMP PDE were possible from the same compound. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments were conducted in rats and mice, respectively, to evaluate the effects of compounds 7e and 23 on platelet aggregation and thrombotic events within these animals. Compound 7e, which has a comparable level of TXA2 synthase (IC50 1.2 microM) and human platelet cAMP PDE (IC50 6.4 microM) inhibitory activities, was found to be orally bioavailable with a long duration of action and offered effective protection against mortality in a collagen-epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism model in mice. Significant blood pressure and heart rate effects were observed for several compounds, e.g. 7e, 9e, 13a, 13d, 18, 20, 21, and 23, when dosed orally in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats.

16959900|t|Endotoxin tolerance attenuates LPS-induced TLR4 mobilization to lipid rafts: a condition reversed by PKC activation.
16959900|a|Endotoxin tolerance is characterized by attenuated macrophage activation to subsequent LPS challenge and can be reversed through nonspecific protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and activation by LPS within naÃ¯ve cells requires the activation of the cell surface receptors CD14 and TLR4 on lipid rafts. The effect of PKC activation and endotoxin tolerance on lipid raft receptor complex assembly is unknown and the focus of this study. Tolerance was induced in THP-1 cells through LPS pre-exposure. NaÃ¯ve and tolerant cells were stimulated with LPS, with or without PMA pretreatment to activate PKC. TLR4 surface expression and LPS binding were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Cellular and lipid raft protein was analyzed for the presence and activation of the TLR4 complex components. Harvested supernatants were examined for TNF-alpha production. Total TLR4 surface expression and LPS binding were not affected by tolerance induction. LPS stimulation of naÃ¯ve cells resulted in TLR4 and heat shock protein (HSP)70 lipid raft mobilization, MAPK activation, and TNF-alpha production. LPS stimulation of tolerant cells was associated with attenuation of all of these cellular events. Although PKC activation by PMA had no effect on naÃ¯ve cells, it did result in reversal in tolerance-induced suppression of TLR4 and HSP70 lipid raft mobilization, MAPK activation, and TNF-alpha production. In addition, the effects associated with PMA were reversed with exposure to a myristoylated PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate. Thus, endotoxin tolerance appears to be induced through attenuated TLR4 formation following LPS stimulation. This complex formation appears to be PKC-dependent, and restoration of PKC activity reverses tolerance.

21052022|t|A functional variant of the NEDD4L gene is associated with beneficial treatment response with b-blockers and diuretics in hypertensive patients.
21052022|a|OBJECTIVE: The capability of the protein NEDD4L to reduce renal tubular expression of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is influenced by a functional rs4149601 G > A NEDD4L polymorphism. As diuretics and b-blockers inhibit renal sodium reabsorption and renin release, respectively, we hypothesized that the b-blocker or diuretic-induced blood pressure reduction and prevention of cardiovascular disease would be greater in patients with the highest ENaC expression (rs4149601 G-allele), whereas there would be no such genetically mediated differences in treatment efficacy among patients treated with the vasodilator diltiazem. METHODS: We related rs4149601 status to 6-month blood pressure reduction and risk of cardiovascular events in 5152 hypertensive patients (DBP >=  100 mmHg) from the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL) randomized to either b-blocker and/or diuretic-based treatment or diltiazem-based treatment. RESULTS: In patients on b-blocker or diuretic monotherapy, carriers of the G-allele had greater SBP reduction (19.5  ± 16.8 vs. 15.0  ± 19.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) and DBP reduction (15.4  ± 8.3vs. 14.1  ± 8.4 mmHg, P = 0.02) and during 4.5 years of follow-up among patients randomized to b-blockers and/or diuretics, carriers of the G-allele had greater protection from cardiovascular events [relative risk (RR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36-0.74, P < 0.001] as compared to AA homozygotes. Within the diltiazem group, there was no difference in blood pressure reduction or risk of cardiovascular events according to genotype. CONCLUSION: The functional NEDD4L rs4149601 polymorphism influences the efficacy of b-blocker and/or diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment both in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular disease protection, whereas diltiazem-based antihypertensive treatment efficacy is not influenced by this NEDD4L polymorphism.

2406062|t|Nickel dermatitis. An update.
2406062|a|Several reports indicate that the prevalence of nickel sensitivity among females in the general population is around 10 per cent and probably is increasing, especially in schoolchildren. It has been claimed that there is such a high correlation between a positive history of nickel hypersensitivity and patch-test results that testing is unnecessary if there is a history of hypersensitivity. This is not true. Nickel hypersensitivity itself is not a serious health problem for the individual. However, when hand eczema also is present, the situation is quite different. Concerns about medical metal implants in nickel-sensitive persons appear to have been exaggerated, and nickel intake in food probably is not a serious difficulty, although some persons may be unusually sensitive. In dealing with the clinical problems of nickel dermatitis, we must not overlook prophylaxis. It seems important to introduce safe methods of ear piercing (a primary source of nickel hypersensitivity) and to spread information about the health hazard potential of the seemingly harmless sensitivity to nickel.

18838910|t|Paget disease of bone: therapeutic options.
18838910|a|Paget disease of bone is a disorder of unknown etiology involving disturbances in bone remodeling, typically leading to bone pain and other complications such as skeletal deformities, fractures, hearing loss, and neurologic complications. Bisphosphonates (BPs), both oral and intravenous, have improved Paget treatment by reducing and normalizing bone turnover, as measured by biochemical markers and by alleviating symptoms. Six BPs are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Paget disease, and each has unique characteristics, such as response rates and requirements for dosage and administration, relevant to clinical outcome. This review provides an overview of these agents-including oral drugs such as alendronate and risedronate, and the intravenous agent zoledronic acid-and briefly discusses other options for managing Paget disease and monitoring treatment efficacy.

19485785|t|Successful nonoperative management of gastrointestinal mucormycosis: novel therapy for invasive disease.
19485785|a|BACKGROUND: Invasive opportunistic fungal infections caused by agents of Mucorales that involve the gastrointestinal tract are uncommon but aggressive. These ubiquitous fungal spores typically are inhaled and can germinate in immunocompromised hosts. Standard therapy for invasive mucormycosis includes parenteral amphotericin B (AMB) in combination with radical debridement of infected tissues. Early diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance. Unfortunately, long-term survival is poor owing to the prohibitive morbidity and mortality rates associated with the medical and surgical therapies. Posaconazole is a novel, extended-spectrum triazole oral antifungal agent with documented success in the treatment of patients with invasive mucormycosis. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 50-year-old man presented with invasive mucormycosis of the lower esophagus, stomach, and liver, resulting in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The infection did not respond to AMB but was treated successfully with a combination of posaconazole and liposomal AMB (LAMB) without surgical debridement. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extensive gastric and intrahepatic mucormycosis that responded to combination posaconazole and LAMB without surgical debridement. This approach may be an alternative to surgery in patients who are precluded from extensive surgical intervention.

17984104|t|Renal and cardiac effects of antihypertensive treatment with ramipril vs metoprolol in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
17984104|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common complication in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This prospective randomized double-blind study was performed to compare the renal and cardiac effects of the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the beta-blocker metoprolol as first line therapy in ADPKD patients with hypertension. METHODS: Forty-six hypertensive ADPKD patients were randomized to either ramipril (n = 23) or metoprolol (n = 23). Twenty-four hour (24-h) ambulatory blood pressure (BP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, urinary albumin excretion (albumin/creatinine ratio), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were established at baseline and at yearly intervals. The total follow-up was 3 years. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased significantly in both the ramipril and the metoprolol group (-8 +/- 2 and -6 +/- 2 mmHg; both P < 0.01). There was a significant decline in renal function during follow-up which was similar in patients treated with ramipril or metoprolol (-2.5 +/- 0.7 vs -2.9 +/- 0.8 ml/min/year; P = NS). After the 3 years follow-up, no differences in GFR, LVMI and urinary albumin excretion were observed between the ramipril and the metoprolol group (80.7 +/- 10.7 vs 78.0 +/- 7.6 ml/min, 102.6 +/- 6.8 vs 100.3 +/- 5.4 g/m(2); and 42.6 +/- 12.3 vs 70.3 +/- 32.5 mg/g, respectively; all P = NS). A post-hoc analysis evaluating the effects of BP control, revealed that LVMI increased in patients with standard BP control while it remained stable in patients with rigorous BP control with a significant difference in LVMI between the groups after 3 years of follow-up (110.5 +/- 6.3 vs 90.9 +/- 4.7 g/m(2); P = 0.017). Also, by the end of the study albuminuria was lower in patients with rigorous vs standard BP control (23.5 +/- 6.7 vs 94.8 +/- 35.4 mg/g; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our study population of hypertensive ADPKD patients, no differences in renal function, urinary albumin excretion and LVMI were detected between those treated with ramipril or metoprolol, respectively, during a 3 years follow-up. Rigorous BP control prevented an increase in LVMI and reduced urinary albumin excretion, suggesting a crucial role of BP control for slowing progression of cardiac and renal organ damage in ADPKD.

8034729|t|Role of ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in ceramide-mediated signal transduction.
8034729|a|Extracellular agonists such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activate the sphingomyelin cycle leading to the generation of ceramide. Ceramide has been suggested as an important mediator of the effect of TNF-alpha on growth inhibition, c-myc down-regulation, apoptosis, and the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B. Although there is no clearly defined intracellular target for ceramide activity, previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) in vitro. Since c-myc is an early downstream cellular target for TNF-alpha, we examined the role of ceramide and CAPP in c-myc down-regulation. In intact HL-60 cells ceramide induced down-regulation of c-myc RNA levels. C2-ceramide was active at 1-10 microM and caused 40-80% inhibition of c-myc RNA levels at 30-120 min of treatment. In nuclear run-on studies, C2-ceramide induced a block to transcription elongation of the c-myc transcript without affecting transcription through the first exon. Therefore, ceramide appeared to inhibit c-myc expression via a mechanism identical with that of TNF-alpha. HL-60 cells contained CAPP which was inhibited by okadaic acid (0.1-10 nm). CAPP in HL-60 cells was activated by D-erythro-ceramide but not D-erythro-dihydroceramide. The specificity of activation of CAPP by ceramide in vitro was matched by a similar specificity of c-myc down-regulation in cells. Moreover, okadaic acid inhibited the effects of ceramide and TNF-alpha on c-myc down-regulation. On the other hand, okadaic acid did not inhibit the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to down-regulate c-myc, demonstrating the existence of at least two distinct pathways in the regulation of c-myc expression. These results demonstrate that CAPP is important for ceramide-induced down-regulation of c-myc in myeloid leukemia cells. The implications of these findings in further delineating a sphingomyelin signaling pathway with important anti-proliferative effects are discussed.

22588126|t|cAMP-elevation mediated by b-adrenergic stimulation inhibits salt-inducible kinase (SIK) 3 activity in adipocytes.
22588126|a|Salt-inducible kinase (SIK) 3 is a virtually unstudied, ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related family of kinases, all of which are regulated by LKB1 phosphorylation of a threonine residue in their activation (T)-loops. Findings in adrenal cells have revealed a role for cAMP in the regulation of SIK1, and recent findings suggest that insulin can regulate an SIK isoform in Drosophila. As cAMP has important functions in adipocytes, mainly in the regulation of lipolysis, we have evaluated a potential role for cAMP, as well as for insulin, in the regulation of SIK3 in these cells. We establish that raised cAMP levels in response to forskolin and the b-adrenergic receptor agonist CL 316,243 induce a phosphorylation of SIK3 in HEK293 cells and primary adipocytes. This phosphorylation coincides with increased 14-3-3 binding to SIK3 in these cell types. Our findings also show that cAMP-elevation results in reduced SIK3 activity in adipocytes. Phosphopeptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis reveal that the cAMP-mediated regulation of SIK3 appears to depend on three residues, T469, S551 and S674, that all contribute to some extent to the cAMP-induced phosphorylation and 14-3-3-binding. As the cAMP-induced regulation can be reversed with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, and a role for other candidate kinases, including PKB and RSK, could be excluded, we believe that PKA is the kinase responsible for SIK3 regulation in response to elevated cAMP levels. Our findings of cAMP-mediated regulation of SIK3 suggest that SIK3 may mediate some of the effects of this important second messenger in adipocytes.

8313327|t|Inhibitory effect of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist RC-3095 and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist SB-75 on the growth of MCF-7 MIII human breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice.
8313327|a|BACKGROUND: The results of several clinical trials using various luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for treatment of advanced breast cancer are encouraging. However, only about 30% of breast cancers are estrogen-dependent and can be treated by hormonal manipulation. New therapeutic approaches combining estrogen ablation therapy with other compounds must be explored. Various studies suggest that bombesin or gastrin-releasing peptide acts as an autocrine growth factor and may play a role in the initiation and progression of some cancers, including that of the breast. METHODS: Female athymic nude mice bearing xenografts of the MCF-7 MIII human breast cancer cell line were treated for 7 weeks with bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist (D-Tpi6, Leu13 psi[CH2NH]-Leu14) bombesin(6-14) (RC-3095) injected subcutaneously daily at a dose of 20 micrograms and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist SB-75 (Cetrorelix) administered biweekly in the form of microgranules releasing 45 micrograms/day. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of treatment, a significant inhibition of tumor volume was observed in the groups treated with RC-3095 alone or in combination with SB-75 but not in those treated with SB-75 as a single agent. After 7 weeks, tumor growth as measured by tumor volume and percentage changes in tumor volume and tumor weight was greatly inhibited in all of the treated groups. Uterine and ovarian weights were reduced and serum luteinizing hormone levels decreased by administration of SB-75 alone or in combination with RC-3095. Histologically, a significant decrease in argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count in tumor cell nuclei was observed in all of the treated groups, indicating a lower proliferation of these cells. High-affinity binding sites for bombesin were detected in cultured MCF-7 MIII cells. Chronic treatment with RC-3095 caused a significant down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptors in tumor cell membranes, which might be related to tumor inhibition. In studies in vitro, SB-75 inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 cells in culture but not proliferation of MCF-7 MIII cells. CONCLUSIONS: Because previously we demonstrated that RC-3095 inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 MIII cells in vitro, it appears that the major antitumoral effect of RC-3095 on the MCF-7 MIII cancer line is direct, whereas that of SB-75 is indirect, and that it is mediated by suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis. In view of its immediate and powerful inhibitory effect on MCF-7 MIII tumors, bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist RC-3095 might be considered as a possible new agent for the treatment of breast cancer.

18545144|t|Idiopathic tracheal stenosis: a clinicopathologic study of 63 cases and comparison of the pathology with chondromalacia.
18545144|a|Tracheal stenosis in adults usually is the result of mechanical injuries either from direct trauma or intubation. Rarely do cases develop in patients without such a precedent history, and there are few reports of the pathology of idiopathic tracheal stenosis (ITS). We reviewed clinicopathologically, 63 tracheal resections for tracheal stenosis in patients who had no antecedent explanation for their stenosis. We contrasted these 63 cases with 34 cases of tracheal stenosis owing to chondromalacia (CM) after mechanical injury. All 63 cases occurred in females, with a mean age of 49 years. The most common symptom was dyspnea on exertion. The average duration of symptoms was greater than 2 years. One-third of the patients gave a history of gastroesophageal reflux. All but one of the cases occurred in the subglottic region and/or upper one-third of the trachea. Pathologically, most cases showed extensive keloidal fibrosis and dilation of mucus glands, a finding that was not obvious in most cases of CM. ITS has relatively normal cartilage with smooth inner and outer perichondrium, whereas CM has extensive degeneration of cartilage with irregular border of inner perichondrium observable at shirt sleeve magnification. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor was positive in fibroblasts cells in most cases. ITS is a rare disease and restricted to females. It may represent some form of fibromatosis. ITS can be distinguished histologically from CM in tracheal resection specimens in most cases.

21345162|t|Rapid development of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations in HIV-infected children less than two years of age initiating protease inhibitor-based therapy in South Africa.
21345162|a|Data on the development of antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1-infected children receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited. We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided.

12605567|t|The potential of nitric oxide therapeutics in stroke.
12605567|a|The therapeutic modulation of the nitric oxide (NO) system has generated considerable interest as a new way for managing many disease processes. In stroke, a useful strategy is to increase NO availability and thereby exploit its beneficial antiplatelet, antiatherosclerotic, haemodynamic and neuroprotective properties. Pharmacologically, this can be achieved by providing NO substrate, using NO donors or by upregulating nitric oxide synthase. Alternatively, one can reduce NO availability by inhibiting NO synthase and thereby limiting its pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic properties. This article reviews developments in NO-related therapeutics for treatment of stroke, with a particular emphasis on compounds that are in the clinical research and development pipeline. Although the routine use of NO therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of stroke cannot currently be recommended, we are evidently at an exciting stage in their pharmacological development. Definitive randomised controlled trials in stroke patients are required as a matter of urgency.

15107197|t|Management of diabetes mellitus occurring during treatment with olanzapine: report of six cases and clinical implications.
15107197|a|In spite of conflicting reports, there is emerging evidence that at least two of the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with an increased risk of developing glucose dysregulation or new onset diabetes mellitus. We report on the management of six patients who developed diabetes mellitus following treatment with olanzapine, five of whom had independent risk factors for diabetes. Olanzapine was changed to quetiapine in all patients with improvement in glycaemic control in two patients. In view of the uncertainty of the size and mechanism of the link between olanzapine and diabetes, we discuss issues surrounding routine clinical management and monitoring of patients on antipsychotics and the clinical implications.

17391824|t|Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and induction of apoptosis in estrogen-nonresponsive breast cancer cells by Antrodia camphorata.
17391824|a|The objective of this study was to investigate the fermented culture broth of Antrodia camphorata (A. camphorata) to induce apoptosis and inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in estrogen-nonresponsive (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells. Treatment of the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells with A. camphorata (40-240 microg/ml) resulted in dose and time-dependent sequences of events marked by apoptosis, as evidenced by loss of cell viability, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied by release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Although the A. camphorata-induced apoptosis was associated with a reduction in Bcl-2 protein levels, negligible Bax increase was observed. Furthermore, A. camphorata treatment inhibited COX-2 protein expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in MDA-MB-231 cells. Analysis of the study data suggests that A. camphorata exerts growth inhibition on (highly invasive) estrogen-nonresponsive human breast cancer cells through apoptosis induction associated with COX-2 inhibition, and that it may possess anticancer properties potentially valuable for application in drug products.

19117293|t|The predictive and therapeutic value of thymidine phosphorylase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in capecitabine (Xeloda)-based chemotherapy for head and neck cancer.
19117293|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether two molecular biomarkers, thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), could be clinically useful in predicting and improving the chemotherapeutic outcome of the oral fluoropyrimidine capecitabine (5'-DFUR or Xeloda), in the treatment of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the TP and DPD expression levels in different HNSCC cell lines. The TP to DPD ratio was calculated and compared to the relative chemosensitivity between cell lines after treatment with 5'-DFUR. The effect of TP transgene expression to alter the TP to DPD ratio and hence optimize the therapeutic outcome of capecitabine treatment was further evaluated in a murine model of human HNSCC using immunohistochemistry to detect TP and DPD expression in vivo. RESULTS: No correlation was detected between sensitivity to 5'-DFUR and the relative expression levels of TP or DPD in the multiple HNSCC cell lines tested. However, significant correlation was observed between the TP to DPD ratio versus drug resistance of the HNSCC cells (r = -0.914, p = 0.0281). In addition, we demonstrate that transgene expression of TP significantly enhanced the tumoricidal effect of capecitabine in HNSCC tumors with otherwise low endogenous TP to DPD ratios. This antitumor effect was observed up to 30 days after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that HNSCC patients who would most benefit from capecitabine-based chemotherapy could be identified by examining the TP to DPD ratio of their tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential role of TP gene therapy in TP to DPD ratio manipulation to optimize the tumoricidal effect of capecitabine.

18768415|t|Sodium bicarbonate vs sodium chloride for the prevention of contrast medium-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography: a randomized trial.
18768415|a|CONTEXT: Sodium bicarbonate has been suggested as a possible strategy for prevention of contrast medium-induced nephropathy, a common cause of renal failure associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased health care costs, and substantial morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine if sodium bicarbonate is superior to sodium chloride for preventing contrast medium-induced nephropathy in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney dysfunction who are undergoing coronary angiography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, controlled, single-blind study conducted between January 2, 2006, and January 31, 2007, and enrolling 353 patients with stable renal disease who were undergoing coronary angiography at a single US center. Included patients were 18 years or older and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or less and 1 or more of diabetes mellitus, history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, or age older than 75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either sodium chloride (n = 178) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 175) administered at the same rate (3 mL/kg for 1 hour before coronary angiography, decreased to 1.5 mL/kg per hour during the procedure and for 4 hours after the completion of the procedure). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary end point was a 25% or greater decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate on days 1 through 4 after contrast exposure. RESULTS: Median patient age was 71 (interquartile range, 65-76) years, and 45% had diabetes mellitus. The groups were well matched for baseline characteristics. The primary end point was met in 13.3% of the sodium bicarbonate group and 14.6% of the sodium chloride group (relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.60; P = .82). In patients randomized to receive sodium bicarbonate vs sodium chloride, the rates of death, dialysis, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events did not differ significantly at 30 days (1.7% vs 1.7%, 0.6% vs 1.1%, 0.6% vs 0%, and 0% vs 2.2%, respectively) or at 30 days to 6 months (0.6% vs 2.3%, 0.6% vs 1.1%, 0.6% vs 2.3%, and 0.6% vs 1.7%, respectively) (P > .10 for all). CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not suggest that hydration with sodium bicarbonate is superior to hydration with sodium chloride for the prevention of contrast medium-induced nephropathy in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease who are undergoing coronary angiography. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00312117.

17706400|t|Encapsulated Bifidobacteria reduced bacterial translocation in rats following hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.
17706400|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of peroral encapsulated Bifidobacteria on intestinal microflora, bacterial translocation (BT), plasma endotoxin, and ileal villi injury in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed daily with three different diet supplements: phosphate buffered saline, Bifidobacteria (10(9) colon-forming units/day), or microencapsulated Bifidobacteria (10(9) colony-forming units/day). After 7 d of treatment, rats were anesthetized for hemorrhagic or sham shock. Then a laparotomy was performed to determine microbiological analysis of cecal content, BT to mesenteric lymph nodes, plasma endotoxin, and terminal ileal villous damage. RESULTS: In the hemorrhagic-shock model, rats pretreated with Bifidobacteria showed decreases in total aerobes in cecum, magnitude of total aerobes to BT, levels of plasma endotoxin, and percentage of ileal villous damage when compared with rats treated with phosphate buffered saline. Encapsulated Bifidobacteria induced greater decreases than intact Bifidobacteria in this model, except for no difference in percentage of ileal villous damage between the two groups. In addition, the incidence of BT was decreased in hemorrhagic rats pretreated with Bifidobacteria compared with control. However, the magnitude of total anaerobes and Bifidobacteria BT were similar among hemorrhagic-shocked rats receiving three different supplements. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacteria can be useful in preventing BT in hemorrhagic-shocked rats, and encapsulated Bifidobacteria can augment this effect further. Peroral administration of Bifidobacteria may be a favorable strategy to prevent sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in hemorrhagic shock.

11693538|t|Anti-angiogenic activities of gliotoxin and its methylthioderivative, fungal metabolites.
11693538|a|In the search for new naturally occurring angiogenic inhibitor, we found that culture broths from two unidentified fungal strains exerted potent inhibitory activities on capillary-like tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Two active compounds were isolated by bioassay-guided separation and their structures were identified as gliotoxin (1) and its derivative methylthiogliotoxin (2) by spectroscopic analyses. These compounds significantly inhibited the migration of HUVEC assessed by in vitro wounding migration assay and exhibited at least 10 times more potent inhibition of proliferation of HUVECs as compared with that of cancer cell lines such as HeLa, MCF-7, and KB 3-1 cells. Especially, gliotoxin having disulfide group exerted more potent activities than methylthiogliotoxin, suggesting that gliotoxin could be a useful compound for further study as an anti-angiogenic agent.

1385654|t|Cholelithiasis associated with medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy in men.
1385654|a|Five out of forty-five adult men, 50 years of age or less, who had received, for at least six months, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Depo Provera) IM, 200-400 mg/week, for prevention of sex-offending or genital-mutilating behavior developed symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thirty of these men were studied with gallbladder ultrasound prospectively off MPA and at six-month intervals while taking the medication and then six months off MPA. Gallstones recovered from two patients were found to have very high cholesterol content, suggesting they were formed in cholesterol supersaturated bile. These findings are consistent with the increased incidence of gallbladder disease related to high-progesterone states and suggest that MPA may be a causative agent in cholelithiasis. The physiologic studies on gallbladder contraction and cholecystokinin release in a subset of the patients failed to provide information on a mechanism for the possible increased incidence of gallbladder disease.

11573953|t|Functional analysis of the transcriptional activity of the mouse phospholipid transfer protein gene.
11573953|a|Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays an important role in the metabolism of plasma high density lipoprotein. The mouse gene encoding PLTP and its promoter region has been cloned in our laboratory. The present study was conducted to functionally analyze the transcriptional regulation of the mouse PLTP gene. The results indicated that DNA sequences between -245 and -69 were responsible for the full promoter activity and binding motifs for transcription factor Sp1 and AP-2 within this functional promoter region were synergistically essential for the basal transcription. The transcriptional activity of this gene was significantly increased by chenodeoxycholic acid and fenofibrate, suggesting that transcription factor farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) are likely involved in the transcriptional regulation. DNA sequence analysis suggests that DNA sequences from -407 to -395 and from -393 to -381 are homologous to the recognition motifs of FXR, and those from -859 to -847 and from -309 to -297 are similar to the potential binding motif for PPAR. These findings provide a molecular basis for further investigation of the physiological function and regulation of the PLTP gene in mice.

21827395|t|Therapeutic rationale for mTOR inhibition in advanced renal cell carcinoma.
21827395|a|Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have entered the landscape of treatment for advanced RCC. Their development has been based on their unique biology and their potential to simultaneously inhibit both tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Despite the solid biologic rationale for their development, existing clinical data is somewhat mixed. Although Temsirolimus is capable of improving overall survival it does so only in a minority of selected mRCC patients and its effects on tumor burden reduction and PFS are minimal. Similarly the activity and clinical utility of Everolimus in the refractory setting is questionable. First, because it is unknown if mTOR becomes the major driver or cancer growth after developing progressive disease on a VEGF inhibitor and secondly because existing sequential VEGF data in same setting appears to be the same if not a bit more robust to that reported with Everolimus. Combination of mTOR and VEGF inhibitors has been disappointing due to the excessive toxicities encountered in early trials without a noticeable difference in efficacy. Efforts are now placed in a series of novel compounds capable of inhibiting mTOR and the upstream signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT.

22705894|t|Anti-cancer activity and mutagenic potential of novel copper(II) quinolinone Schiff base complexes in hepatocarcinoma cells.
22705894|a|This study determined the cytotoxic, cyto-selective and mutagenic potential of novel quinolinone Schiff base ligands and their corresponding copper(II) complexes in human-derived hepatic carcinoma cells (Hep-G2) and non-malignant human-derived hepatic cells (Chang). Results indicated that complexation of quinolinone Schiff bases with copper served to significantly enhance cytotoxicity. Here, the complex of (7E)-7-(3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideamino)-4-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one (TV117-FM) exhibited the lowest IC(50) value (17.9 µM) following 96 h continuous exposure, which was comparable to cisplatin (15.0 µM). However, results revealed that TV117-FM lacked cytoselectivity over non-malignant cells. Additionally, the complex was minimally effluxed from cells via Pglycoprotein (P-gp) and was shown to be non-mutagenic in the Standard Ames test. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays showed that it was capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis in a concentrationand time-dependent manner. However, inhibition was not as a consequence of DNA intercalation, as illustrated in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Interestingly, it was shown that the ligand was capable of inhibiting the action of topoisomerase II, but this was lost following complexation. This indicated that the mechanism of action of the novel copper(II) complex was different from that of the parent ligand and suggests that TV117-FM may have a therapeutic role to play in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies are currently underway to elucidate the exact in vitro mechanism of action of this novel, metal-based anti-cancer agent.

15851917|t|Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor phenotypic hypersusceptibility can be demonstrated in different assays.
15851917|a|BACKGROUND: HIV-1 isolates harboring multiple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations are more susceptible ("hypersusceptible") to the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) than isolates lacking NRTI resistance mutations, but this has only been reported with a single-cycle replication phenotypic assay. In fact, there was a report that a commercial multicycle assay did not readily detect hypersusceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To see whether NNRTI hypersusceptibility can be demonstrated in other types of phenotypic assays, including multicycle assays and enzyme inhibition assays. METHODS: The susceptibility of HIV-1 clones derived from different patients in multicycle assays was tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in an established cell line. In addition, the reverse transcriptase (RT) of many of these clones was expressed and their susceptibility tested in an RT inhibition assay. Nevirapine and efavirenz susceptibilities were tested and compared with a control wild-type virus or RT. RESULTS: Hypersusceptibility to nevirapine and efavirenz was detected using each of the methods described above. R values correlating the other methods with single-cycle assay values were between 0.66 and 0.96. In addition to the high correlations, the different methods gave similar numeric results. CONCLUSIONS: NNRTI hypersusceptibility is readily seen in multicycle susceptibility assays and in enzyme inhibition assays.

17982887|t|Low dose methylphenidate improves freezing in advanced Parkinson's disease during off-state.
17982887|a|Five men with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) were examined to assess the effect of low dose methylphenidate (MPD) on gait. The patients were tested during "off" state before and two hours after the intake of 10 mg MPD while walking an "8 trajectory". The total walking time, total freezing time, number of freezing episodes and the non-freezing walking time were assessed. The obtained data were compared by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test with a type I error rate of 0.05. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in all gait parameters after MPD intake. Moreover, a good correlation in the grade of improvement for each individual gait characteristic was found. The study demonstrates that low dose of MPD may improve gait, and especially freezing, in patients with severe PD, without the need for exogenous L-dopa. The mechanism of MPD action in patients with advanced PD is further discussed.

10386321|t|Conjugated linoleic acid and other anticarcinogenic agents of bovine milk fat.
10386321|a|Prevention is an important strategy for conquering cancer. Milk fat contains a number of components, such as conjugated linoleic acid, sphingomyelin, butyric acid, ether lipids, beta-carotene, and vitamins A and D that have anticancer potential. Conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the growth of a number of human cancer cell lines and suppresses chemically-induced tumor development at a number of sites in animal models. As little as 0.1% of dietary conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the development of rat mammary tumors, independent of the amount and type of fat in the diet. Sphingomyelin, through its metabolites ceramide and sphingosine, participates in multiple antiproliferative pathways associated with suppression of carcinogenesis. Dietary sphingomyelin inhibits murine colon tumor development. Butyric acid, uniquely present in ruminant milk, is a potent antineoplastic agent and may ameliorate its potency through synergy with other milk fat components. Dietary butyric acid inhibits mammary carcinoma development in rats. In humans, ether lipids, beta-carotene, and vitamins A and D are associated with anticancer effects. Cows have the ability to extract anticarcinogenic components from pasture and feed and transfer them to milk. Use of genetic engineering and other techniques to increase the range and level of anticarcinogens in pasture and supplements may increase the anticancer potential of milk.

9278187|t|Review the role of dopamine D4 receptors in schizophrenia and antipsychotic action.
9278187|a|For the past 20 years the most enduring explanation for schizophrenia has been the dopamine hypothesis, which proposes that the dopaminergic system is overactive in this widespread disease. Classically, the D2 receptor formed the core of the dopamine hypothesis since there was considerable evidence for elevations of D2 receptor levels in the brains of schizophrenic patients, and because these receptors served as the primary target in mediating antipsychotic effects of most neuroleptics. However, the dopamine D4 receptor has recently received particular attention in this context. This is because the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, which is effective in treating refractory schizophrenics without the side-effect profile of typical neuroleptics, displays a 10-fold higher affinity for D4 compared to D2 or D3 receptors. Furthermore, the concentration in plasma water of clinical doses ofclozapine correlates well with its in vitro binding affinity for D4, but not D2 or D3 receptors, suggesting that D4 is a potential target in mediating clozapine's antipsychotic effects. As well, marked elevations in the level of a D4-like site (not identical to the D4 receptor) has been seen in the striatum of postmortem schizophrenic brains, but not in control brains. Finally, the most interesting feature of the D4 receptor is perhaps the array of polymorphisms associated with it, creating structural diversity in this receptor that supercedes all other known catecholamine receptors. The existence of these D4 polymorphisms raises the possibility that structural variations of this receptor may be associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia, or observed variations in individual response to clozapine treatment. However, several studies aimed at investigating these hypotheses could not establish a direct role of D4 in schizophrenia. Furthermore, no association was evident between the polymorphic forms of D4 and susceptibility to schizophrenia, or variable clozapine response. Nevertheless, investigations surrounding this receptor has been far from futile. The observations which support the idea that D4 might serve as a target for clozapine have significantly modified and extended our understanding of mechanisms underlying atypical antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia. Further characterization of this receptor may prove to be crucial in designing highly effective antipsychotic drugs with minimal contraindications.

10749680|t|The Shc-related adaptor protein, Sck, forms a complex with the vascular-endothelial-growth-factor receptor KDR in transfected cells.
10749680|a|Despite much progress in recent years, the precise signalling events triggered by the vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF) receptors, fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt1) and kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), are incompletely defined. Results obtained when Flt1 and KDR are individually expressed in fibroblasts or porcine aortic endothelial cells have not been entirely consistent with those observed in other endothelial cells expressing both receptors endogenously. It has also been difficult to demonstrate VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Flt1, which has led to speculation that KDR may be the more important receptor for the mitogenic action of VEGF on endothelial cells. In an attempt to identify physiologically important effectors which bind to KDR, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid mouse embryo library with the cytoplasmic domain of KDR. Here we describe the identification of the adaptor protein, Shc-like protein (Sck), as a binding partner for KDR. We demonstrate that this interaction requires phosphorylation of KDR, and identify the binding site for the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain as tyrosine-1175 of KDR. We have also shown that the SH2 domain of Sck, but not that of Src-homology collagen protein (Shc), can precipitate phosphorylated KDR from VEGF-stimulated porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing KDR, and that an N-terminally truncated Sck protein can associate with KDR, in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion, when co-expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the two-hybrid assay, both Shc and Sck SH2 domains can associate with the related receptor Flt1.

24239615|t|Glucocorticoid inhibition of activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression in human B lymphocytes.
24239615|a|We examined whether glucocorticoids could modulate the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), the principal regulator of the processes of immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B lymphocytes. Treatment of human B cells with IL-4 and anti-CD40 antibody for 18-20h resulted in induction of expression of AICDA mRNA by over 10-fold. Dexamethasone at 10nM concentration inhibited AICDA induction by an average of 51.8% (p<0.0001). These effects of glucocorticoids were found to be dose dependent in the physiologic range and were reversible by co-treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Human B cell viability and proliferation were unaltered by glucocorticoid treatment. These data demonstrate that physiologic concentrations of glucocorticoids can act on human B lymphocytes through glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanisms to diminish the expression of AICDA, a key regulator of humoral immune responses.

7952483|t|Salutary effect of reduced glutathione on renal function in coronary artery bypass operation.
7952483|a|BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure are serious complications of open heart operations. Previous reports have suggested beneficial effects of exogenous glutathione for preservation of renal function after ischemic renal injury. We prospectively studied the effect of perioperative administration of glutathione on renal function in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass operation. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred mg per kg of glutathione was administered to the treated group (n = 10) before cardiopulmonary bypass, and on the first and second postoperative days. The control group was administered placebo in the same volume. Hemodynamics, renal function, and plasma hormone levels were measured consecutively. RESULTS: In the glutathione group, the mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index were lower than in the control group. Urine volume, creatinine clearance, and renal excretory index were well preserved in the group treated with glutathione. Moreover, the fractional excretion of sodium was lower and urine and plasma osmolarity was higher in the group treated with glutathione. No differences in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, or aldosterone concentrations between the two groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative glutathione treatment has a salutary effect on perioperative renal function through effects on both renal hemodynamics and tubular mechanism.

19023807|t|Apoptotic cell death through inhibition of protein kinase CKII activity by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde purified from Xanthium strumarium.
19023807|a|The CKII inhibitory compound was purified from the fruit of Xanthium strumarium by organic solvent extraction and silica gel chromatography. The inhibitory compound was identified as 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde by analysis with FT-IR, FAB-Mass, EI-Mass, (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde inhibited the phosphotransferase activity of CKII with IC(50) of about 783 microM. Steady-state studies revealed that the inhibitor acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate ATP. A value of 138.6 microM was obtained for the apparent K(i). Concentration of 300 microM 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde caused 50% growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde-induced cell death was characterised with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3. Furthermore, the inhibitor induced the fragmentation of DNA into multiples of 180 bp, indicating that it triggered apoptosis. This induction of apoptosis by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was also confirmed by using flow cytometry analysis. Since CKII is involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis, these results suggest that 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde may function by inhibiting oncogenic disease, at least in part, through the inhibition of CKII activity.

15361893|t|Trends in antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy in subjects with type II diabetes: clinical effectiveness or clinical discretion?
15361893|a|Hypertension and lipid disorders in type II diabetes contribute to increased coronary risk, but optimal drug therapy has not been defined. We investigated primary care physicians choices of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy for subjects with type II diabetes diagnosed with hypertension. Subjects were registered with 105 UK general practices in the General Practice Research Database and prescribed oral hypoglycaemic drugs for the first time between January 1993 and December 2001. We evaluated prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs in subjects with secondary diagnoses of hypertension in the first year following initiation of oral hypoglycaemic therapy. Data were analysed for 4519 diabetic subjects with diagnosed hypertension. Between 1993 and 2001, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics increased from 20 to 30%; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors from 35 to 45% and angiotensin receptor blockers from 0 to 8%. The proportion of subjects prescribed lipid-lowering therapy increased from 8% in 1993 to 33% in 2001, with the proportion prescribed statins increasing from 1 to 30%. At different general practices, the proportion prescribed thiazide diuretics ranged from 0 to 52%, beta-blockers from 5 to 60%, ACE inhibitors from 15 to 81%, and statins from 0 to 50%. Variation between practices was not explained by adjusting for age, sex, prevalent coronary heart disease or study year. Trends in drug utilisation were consistent with the evolving evidence base but there were wide variations in drug utilisation between practices. A more consistent approach to drug selection might be associated with improved patient outcomes.

20597903|t|Association of SLC6A12 variants with aspirin-intolerant asthma in a Korean population.
20597903|a|Aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) occurs from asthma exacerbation after exposure to aspirin. However, the underlying mechanisms of AIA occurrence are still unclear. The critical role of the solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, betaine/GABA) member 12 (SLC6A12) gene in GABAergic transmission, which is associated with mucus production in asthma, makes it a candidate gene for AIA association study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC6A12 were genotyped in 163 aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients of Korean ethnicity. Associations between polymorphisms of SLC6A12 and AIA were analysed using multivariate logistic analysis. Results showed that two polymorphisms and a haplotype in SLC6A12, rs499368 (P= 0.005; P(corr)= 0.03), rs557881 (non-synonymous C10R, P= 0.007; P(corr)= 0.04), and SLC6A12_BL1_ht1 (P= 0.009; P(corr)= 0.05) respectively, were significantly associated with AIA after multiple testing corrections. In addition, SNPs of SLC6A12 were significantly associated with the fall rate of FEV(1) by aspirin provocation suggesting that SLC6A12 could affect reversibility of lung function abnormalities in AIA patients. Although these results are preliminary and future replications are needed to confirm these findings, this study showed evidence of association between variants in SLC6A12 and AIA occurrence among asthmatics in a Korean population.

18854938|t|Sporadic and outbreak cases of melioidosis in southern Taiwan: clinical features and antimicrobial susceptibility.
18854938|a|BACKGROUND: Melioidosis has been well known to be endemic in Thailand and Northern Australia, and was reported sporadically in Taiwan before 2005. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 58 patients with melioidosis in southern Taiwan from 2000 to 2005, including 40 clustered and 18 sporadic cases, for clinical characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Fifty-one (88%) cases were found during the rainy season, and there was a significant correlation between the average monthly rainfalls and the case number (r = 0.37; p = 0.001). Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease (35 cases, 60%). The majority (52 cases, 90%) had never traveled abroad before illness, indicating indigenous acquisition of Burkholderia pseudomallei. In comparison, clustered cases were older, less often had underlying diabetes mellitus and had a shorter duration of clinical symptoms before admission than sporadic cases. Acute form of melioidosis predominated, and shock at admission was independently associated with a grave prognosis. Overall, 22% of 58 patients died in hospitals. Ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline, as previously recommended, were the potentially therapeutic choices. The role of piperacillin/ tazobactam for melioidosis remains undefined. CONCLUSIONS: Melioidosis can occur sporadically or in a cluster in diabetic patients during rainy seasons in Taiwan.

21729479|t|Parent calcium-rich-food practices/perceptions are associated with calcium intake among parents and their early adolescent children.
21729479|a|OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to (i) segment parents of early adolescents into subgroups according to their Ca-rich-food (CRF) practices and perceptions regarding early adolescent CRF intake and (ii) determine whether Ca intake of parents and early adolescents differed by subgroup. DESIGN: A cross-sectional convenience sample of 509 parents and their early adolescent children completed a questionnaire in 2006-2007 to assess parent CRF practices and perceptions and to estimate parent and child Ca intakes. SETTING: Self-administered questionnaires were completed in community settings or homes across nine US states. SUBJECTS: Parents self-reporting as Asian, Hispanic or non-Hispanic White with a child aged 10-13 years were recruited through youth or parent events. RESULTS: Three parent CRF practice/perception segments were identified, including 'Dedicated-Milk Providers/Drinkers' (49 %), 'Water Regulars' (30 %) and 'Sweet-Drink-Permissive Parents' (23 %). Dedicated-Milk Providers/Drinkers were somewhat older and more likely to be non-Hispanic White than other groups. Ca intakes from all food sources, milk/dairy foods and milk only, and milk intakes, were higher among early adolescent children of Dedicated-Milk Providers/Drinkers compared with early adolescents of parents in other segments. Soda pop intakes were highest for early adolescents with parents in the Water Regulars group than other groups. Dedicated-Milk Providers/Drinkers scored higher on culture/tradition, health benefits and ease of use/convenience subscales and lower on a dairy/milk intolerance subscale and were more likely to report eating family dinners daily than parents in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Parent education programmes should address CRF practices/perceptions tailored to parent group to improve Ca intake of early adolescent children.

24756918|t|Challenging a surgical dictum: results from a 10-year experience on the safety of open inguinal herniorrhaphy in patients on chronic warfarin therapy.
24756918|a|BACKGROUND: Previous reports document the safety of open inguinal herniorrhaphy in patients on chronic warfarin therapy; however, the practice remains controversial. This study is a 10-year update of our experience. METHODS: A retrospective review of 1,839 consecutive patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair was conducted from 2000 to 2010. All patients on chronic warfarin therapy were included. Three groups: continuation (CW), discontinuation (DW) and case-matched control (C) not on warfarin therapy were compared for operative details and postoperative complications. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients were on chronic warfarin therapy. Of these, 40 patients (25%) continued on warfarin during the perioperative period (CW). Average preoperative international normalized ratio (INR) was 2.15  ± 0.76 for CW and 1.38  ± 0.42 for DW, p < 0.001. Mean operative times were equivalent between all three groups (88 min CW vs. 85 min DW vs. 79 min C, p = 0.518). Although CW patients experienced higher incidences of both hematoma and urinary retention overall, no statistically significant differences in complication rates were seen between the three groups (hematoma = 10 vs. 8% DW vs. 5% C, p = 0.703; urinary retention = 15 vs. 10% DW vs. 8% C, p = 0.541). Comparing patients by INR, there were no statistically different postoperative complication rates, particularly for hematoma (8% INR <2 vs. 9.5% INR = 2-3 vs. 20% INR >3, p = 0.65). CONCLUSION: Maintenance of warfarin therapy during the perioperative period for open inguinal herniorrhaphy results in equivalent operative times and postoperative complications as discontinuation.

16280040|t|Targeted therapy against Bcl-2-related proteins in breast cancer cells.
16280040|a|INTRODUCTION: Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL confer resistance to apoptosis, thereby reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy. We examined the relationship between the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells, with the aim of developing specific targeted therapy. METHODS: Four human breast cancer cell lines were examined, and the effects of antisense (AS) Bcl-2 and AS Bcl-xL phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on chemosensitivity were tested in vitro and in vivo. Chemosensitivity was evaluated by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the antitumor effect was assessed in vivo by the success of xenograft transplantation into athymic mice. RESULTS: Treatment with AS Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL ODNs resulted in a sequence-specific decrease in protein expression, compared with controls. Treatment of BT-474, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-231 cells with AS Bcl-2 increased chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX), mitomycin C (MMC), paclitaxel (TXL), and docetaxel (TXT). Transfection of the Bcl-2 gene into MDA-MB-453 cells decreased sensitivity to DOX and MMC. Treatment of MDA-MB-231, BT-474, and ZR-75-1 cells with AS Bcl-xL increased chemosensitivity to DOX, MMC and taxanes to a smaller extent than AS Bcl-2. This occurred in the setting of increased Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as well as decreased Bcl-2 and pAkt. AS Bcl-2 ODNs induced splenomegaly in association with increased serum IL-12, which was attenuated by methylation of the CpG motifs of AS Bcl-2; however, methylated CpG failed to negate the increased antitumor effect of AS Bcl-2. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, to a smaller extent, are major determinants of chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Targeted therapy against Bcl-2 protein with the use of AS ODNs might enhance the effects of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

22047990|t|Bradykinin enhances Sindbis virus infection in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
22047990|a|Sindbis virus (SINV) induces inflammatory and vasoactive responses that are associated with rash and arthritis in human infections. The mechanisms underlying infection-associated microvasculopathy are still unknown. We investigated whether endothelial cells infected by SINV are differentially responsive to bradykinin (BK), a potent inducer of inflammatory edema in a broad range of infectious diseases. Human endothelial cells (HBMECs) infected with SINV presented an upregulation of bradykinin B2 receptors (BK2R) expression. Also, BK reduced SINV-induced apoptosis and enhanced virus replication in HBMECs in a way dependent on BK2R, PI3 kinase and ERK signaling. Strikingly, intracerebral infection of mice in the presence of a BK2R antagonist reduced the local viral load. Our data suggest that SINV infection renders human endothelial cells hypersensitive to BK, which increases host cell survival and viral replication. Ongoing studies may clarify if the deregulation of the kinin pathway contributes to infection-associated vasculopathies in life-threatening arbovirus infections.

14594106|t|Potential human cancer risks from exposure to PCBs: a tale of two evaluations.
14594106|a|In 1999 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released a Draft Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). In reviewing the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, ATSDR (1999) concluded that "The weight of evidence does not support a causal association for PCBs and human cancer at this time." Just 1 year later, in an updated Toxicological Profile for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), the conclusions of another analysis (ATSDR, 2000) on whether exposure to PCBs might represent a carcinogenic risk to humans had dramatically changed to "Overall, the human studies provide some evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic" and "some of these studies provide meaningful evidence that PCBs are carcinogenic in humans." Because this is a substantially different conclusion than that reached only one year previously, it raises a number of questions that must be considered particularly since "weight of evidence" has a precise meaning in the context of evaluating a body of epidemiological data. The present review addresses the additional scientific data that became available between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations that was of a magnitude to offset the weight of evidence from numerous epidemiological studies that exposure to PCBs was not causally associated with human cancer to a conclusion only 1 year later that there was now "meaningful evidence" that PCBs posed a carcinogenic risk to humans. Also of interest are the criteria upon which this conclusion is based and the distinction between "weight of evidence" and the newer descriptors of "some evidence" and "meaningful evidence." However, as shown in this review, only one relevant study was published between the ATSDR 1999 and 2000 evaluations and the results of this study were unequivocally supportive of the 1999 conclusion. Because of the continuing controversy surrounding this issue, in this review, all relevant epidemiological data on PCBs are summarized and subjected to another weight of evidence evaluation. This critical review is based on the most recent guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1999a, 2003) for conducting weight-of-evidence evaluations on a body of epidemiological data. Applying a weight-of-evidence evaluation to the PCB epidemiological studies can only lead to the conclusion that there is no causal relationship between PCB exposure and any form of cancer, thereby confirming the conclusions of ATSDR (1999). Also considered is the methodology and logic used by ATSDR (2000) that resulted in overturning the weight of evidence conclusions concerning the human carcinogenicity of PCBs in ATSDR (1999). This issue may have public health and policy implications. It seems appropriate that unbiased evaluations of a body of data, even of controversial issues such as the potential human carcinogenicity of PCBs, be conducted in a transparent manner following applicable guidelines. The dramatic differences between the conclusions of ATSDR (1999) and ATSDR (2000) do not appear to be consistent with this process.

1455308|t|Bombesin stimulates growth of human gastrinoma.
1455308|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the first establishment and characterization of a functioning human gastrinoma (PT) xenograft. Bombesin, the equivalent of the mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide, has trophic effects on normal and neoplastic tissues of the gastrointestinal tract; the effects of gut hormones on the growth of gastrinoma are not known. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to determine the presence of various gut peptides in PT and (2) to determine the effect of bombesin on the growth of PT xenografts. METHODS: PT tumors were examined for expression (mRNA and protein) of various gut peptides by Northern hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In addition, PT xenografts were implanted as 3 mm2 pieces bilaterally subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. Mice were divided into two groups to receive either bombesin (5 micrograms/kg) or saline administered as intraperitoneal injections every 8 hours. Tumor area was measured twice weekly until mice were sacrificed (day 28), when tumor and normal pancreas were removed, weighed, and assayed for DNA and protein content. RESULTS: Both mRNAs and peptides of gastrin and chromogranin A were present in PT tumors. Bombesin significantly stimulated growth of PT tumors from day 18 until mice were sacrificed (day 28). As expected, bombesin stimulated pancreatic growth. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time that bombesin is a trophic hormone for gastrinoma. The unique cell line PT contains gastrin and chromogranin A and will be a useful model to define the biologic mechanisms controlling the growth of human gastrinomas.

12067585|t|Screening for heterocyclic amines in chicken cooked in various ways.
12067585|a|Chicken cooked under well-controlled conditions and commercial chicken products were screened for heterocyclic amines (HAs). Chicken samples were boiled, deep-fried, pan-fried, oven-roasted, cooked in an unglazed clay pot or in a roasting bag in the oven, and oven broiled. 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (harman) and 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (norharman) were identified in several samples. Chicken cooked at low temperatures contained low amounts of HAs. In pan-fried chicken breasts, MeIQx was detected in amounts below 2 ng/g, 4,8-DiMeIQx below 0.6 ng/g, and PhIP in amounts up to 38 ng/g. Harman and norharman were detected in almost all samples (below 15 ng/g). In skin from a commercially barbecued chicken, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx and PhIP were detected, while only traces of MeIQx were detected in the meat. MeIQx was detected in a commercial chicken flavour, 0.1 ng/ml. No HAs were detected in pan-fried chicken liver. The results show that the content of HAs in chicken cooked in various ways is low if prepared at low temperatures, and increases with increasing cooking temperature. PhIP formation seems to start accelerating at cooking temperatures around or above 200 degrees C. Colour development increases with cooking temperature, but no correlation with HA content was observed.

22511051|t|Profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of Andhra Pradesh, India.
22511051|a|INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India, through the use of questionnaires. The data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. These drugs were found to be in high demand. Among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: Escherichia coli (36%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). In terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.

19743496|t|The usage patterns of cardiac bedside markers employing point-of-care testing for troponin in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome: results from CRUSADE.
19743496|a|BACKGROUND: Point-of-care (POC) testing may expedite the care of emergency department (ED) patients suspected of having acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We evaluated the use patterns of cardiac bedside markers or POC testing for troponin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS. METHODS: NSTE ACS data were collected from the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines (CRUSADE) registry. We compared hospital and patient characteristics, in-hospital events, and process-of-care variables between hospitals to those that did not use POC testing in > or = 50% of enrolled patients. We examined characteristics, in-hospital events, and process-of-care differences between patients with negative vs positive troponin POC testing results. RESULTS: Of 568 hospitals, 74 (16,276 patients) had high POC usage compared with 197 hospitals (50,782 patients) with no troponin POC usage. From the high POC usage hospitals, 12,604 patients had recorded troponin POC test results. Hospitals with high POC usage had a shorter ED length of stay and were less likely to administer aspirin, beta-blockers, and heparin during the first 24 hours of care. Patients with positive troponin POC results were more often older, minority, female, Medicare-insured, diabetic, and renally impaired. They had fewer electrocardiograms within 10 minutes but were more likely to get aspirin, beta-blockers, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and heparin within 24 hours of arrival. They also had longer ED lengths of stay, received fewer in-hospital and interventional procedures, and had more adverse clinical events. CONCLUSION: Differences existed in how hospitals used POC testing and the care given based on those results. Positive POC results are associated with expedited and higher use of anti-ischemic therapies.

18471462|t|Risk stratification assessed by combined lung and heart iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
18471462|a|Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) has been used to assess myocardial sympathetic nervous activity and severity of heart failure. (123)I-MIBG is also used as a potential marker of pulmonary endothelial cell function and may be related to pulmonary hypertension. Thus, we hypothesized that combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG kinetics predicts future clinical outcome more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone in patients with chronic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we examined 123I-MIBG scintigrams in 62 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Anterior planar images were obtained 15 minutes and 3 hours after 123I-MIBG injection. Cardiac and pulmonary 123I-MIBG activities were quantified as heart-to-mediastinum activity ratio and lung-to-mediastinum activity ratio. We introduced lung-to-heart activity ratio as the new 123I-MIBG parameter including myocardial sympathetic nerve activity and pulmonary endothelial cell function. Delayed lung-to-heart ratio was correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.48, p <0.0001), disease duration (r = 0.49, p <0.0001), and number of heart failure episodes (r = 0.55, p <0.0001). During a mean follow-up of 25 months, 15 patients had a cardiac event. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves for prediction of the event was greatest in delayed lung-to-heart ratio (lung to heart 0.92, heart to mediastinum 0.83, lung to mediastinum 0.80). In multivariate analysis, the lung-to-heart ratio (hazard ratio 2.76/0.1 increase, p = 0.002) was selected as an independent predictor for a future cardiac event. In conclusion, the combined assessment of lung and heart 123I-MIBG uptake may help to predict future clinical outcome for patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy more accurately than myocardial evaluation alone.

15834610|t|A microbiological and confocal microscopy study documenting a slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from a nylon corneal suture of a patient with antibiotic-resistant endophthalmitis.
15834610|a|BACKGROUND: We describe a case of posttraumatic endophthalmitis unresponsive to systemic (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), intra-ocular (vancomycin) and topical (ofloxacin, tetracycline and sulfametoxazole) antibiotic therapy. Microbiological and confocal microscopy studies of a nylon corneal suture revealed the presence of a slime-producing strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: We describe the history and clinical presentation of a 77-year-old man in whom a high-grade posttraumatic endophthalmitis resolved only after the removal of a single nylon corneal suture. Microbiological investigations of the aqueous, vitreous and suture were performed, and the propensity of the suture-associated isolate to form biofilm was assessed using confocal microscopy. RESULTS: A single stain of S. epidermidis was isolated from both aqueous and vitreous specimens and from the suture. The planktonic form of the isolate was susceptible in vitro to the antibiotics administered to the patient, but the strain was capable of forming biofilms and this phenotype showed resistance to high concentrations of the same antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a slime-producing strain of S. epidermidis should be considered in endophthalmitis that is unresponsive to specific antibiotic therapy, especially in cases in which an intra-ocular foreign body (e.g., a suture) is present.

16406864|t|Secondary hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer.
16406864|a|PURPOSE: Androgen ablation remains the cornerstone of management for advanced prostate cancer. Therapeutic options in patients with progressive disease following androgen deprivation include antiandrogen withdrawal, secondary hormonal agents and chemotherapy. Multiple secondary hormonal agents have clinical activity and the sequential use of these agents may lead to prolonged periods of clinical response. We provide a state-of-the-art review of the various agents currently used for secondary hormonal manipulation and discusses their role in the systemic treatment of patients with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the peer reviewed literature was performed on the topic of secondary hormonal therapies, including oral antiandrogens, adrenal androgen inhibitors, corticosteroids, estrogenic compounds, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists and alternative hormonal therapies for advanced prostate cancer. RESULTS: Secondary hormonal therapies can provide a safe and effective treatment option in patients with AIPC. The use of steroids and adrenolytics, such as ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide, has resulted in symptomatic improvement and a greater than 50% prostate specific antigen decrease in a substantial percent of patients with AIPC. A similar clinical benefit has been demonstrated with estrogen based therapies. Furthermore, these therapies have demonstrated a decrease in metastatic disease burden. Other novel hormonal therapies are currently under investigation and they may also show promise as secondary hormonal therapies. Finally, guidelines from the United States Food and Drug Administration Prostate Cancer Endpoints Workshop were reviewed in the context of developing new agents. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary hormonal therapy serves as an excellent therapeutic option in patients with AIPC in whom primary hormonal therapy has failed. Practicing urologists should familiarize themselves with these oral medications, their indications and their potential side effects.

15974915|t|Nitric oxide mimetic molecules as therapeutic agents in Alzheimer's disease.
15974915|a|Nitric oxide is multifunctional messenger molecule in the brain, playing important roles including in learning and memory and in regulating the expression of trophic factors that may be reduced with aging. Small molecules that mimic the biological activity of NO, NO mimetics, will bypass cholinergic receptor activation and are anticipated to provide multiple pathways of treating and circumventing dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and cGMP formation in the brain represents one element of effective neuroprotective pathways mediated by NO. Substantial evidence suggests that NO mimetics may display cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent activity and may operate via multiple biochemical signaling pathways, both to ensure the survival of neurons subjected to stress and also to provide cognition-enabling pathways to circumvent dementia. GT 1061 is an NO mimetic compound currently in clinical trials for Alzheimer's. A survey of current research indicates that NO mimetics will provide a combined neuroprotective and cognition-enabling approach to anti-neurodegenerative therapy.

17611855|t|Experimental osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy and vitamin D deficiency does not markedly affect fracture healing in rats.
17611855|a|BACKGROUND: The question of whether fracture healing and mechanical properties of the callus are influenced by osteoporosis (OP) is still not settled. We therefore studied this issue in vitamin D-depleted ovariectomized (OVX) rats, an OP model previously shown to induce weakening of the femoral neck, and thus thought to be closer to the human condition than the classic OVX rat model. METHODS: 72 female Wistar rats were randomized into two groups: ovariectomy and vitamin D-deficient diet (Ovx-D group) or sham operation and normal rat chow (Sham group). After 12 weeks, a closed tibial midshaft fracture was performed on the right side and fixed with an intramedullary nail. Bone loss and callus formation were monitored with DXA; serum levels of estradiol and vitamin D3 were measured and histomorphometric analyses were performed. Mechanical properties of callus, tibia, femoral shaft, and femoral neck were examined in 3-point cantilever bending 6 weeks after fracture. RESULTS: The Ovx-D group showed reduced BMD in the spine and femoral neck, and reduced trabecular bone volume in the femoral head. There were no differences in BMD and mechanical properties of callus between the groups. Except for reduced stiffness of the right femoral neck in the Ovx-D group (p = 0.02), no differences in the mechanical strength of long bones were detected. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the systemic effects of estrogen and vitamin D deficiency are not crucial for fracture healing or mechanical properties of the callus.

19251823|t|Interactions of olomoucine II with human liver microsomal cytochromes P450.
19251823|a|Olomoucine II is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and a potential antineoplastic agent because it can arrest animal cell cycles. This study examines its interactions with human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. Spectroscopic and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to estimate the degree of olomoucine II-mediated inhibition of enzymatic activities of eight drug-metabolizing P450s in vitro. In addition, mass spectrometry coupled with HPLC was used to identify an olomoucine II metabolite (2,5-dihydroxyroscovitine) formed in the reaction mixtures, and CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for the hydroxylation of the N(6)-benzyl ring at position 5, leading to this compound. Olomoucine II significantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and (to a lesser degree) CYP3A4. The results indicate that use of olomoucine II as a drug could affect the activities of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9 in vivo. Hence, the clinical relevance of these interactions should be carefully evaluated.

12373304|t|Dietary bile acids inhibit potentially elemental diet-induced small intestinal atrophy in rats.
12373304|a|The mechanism responsible for elemental diet (ED)-induced small intestinal atrophy is still unknown. However, it is possible that bile acids in the gut lumen influence this process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral bile acid administration during ED feeding. Specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 weeks old, were fed an ED only, ED plus 0.1% (w/w) hyocholic acid, or ED plus 0.1% (w/w) hyodeoxycholic acid ad libitum for 4 weeks. The control rats were fed standard chow ad libitum for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the wet weight and whole length of the small intestine, and the mucosal diamine oxidase (DAO) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured. Microscopic histological observation was also performed. ED feeding induced atrophy and elevations in the mucosal DAO and ALP activities in the small intestine. Hyocholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid administration both tended to inhibit these alterations. In conclusion, ED feeding induced atrophy and elevations in the mucosal DAO and ALP activities in the small intestine. Oral bile acid administration may prevent this atrophy and the elevations in mucosal DAO and ALP activities, which may lead to new therapeutic strategies in patients managed with ED.

21327908|t|Pathophysiological idiosyncrasies and pharmacokinetic realities may interfere with tacrolimus dose titration in liver transplantation.
21327908|a|PURPOSE: To explore the main factors that make it difficult to empirically monitor tacrolimus (TAC) in the early period post-liver transplantation (LTx), with a specific focus on those aspects related to patient idiosyncrasy and clinical status as well as to the pharmacokinetic (PK) assumptions on which drug individualization in clinical practice is based. METHODS: Retrospective monitoring data from 75 de novo liver transplant patients treated with twice daily with TAC and followed for up to 15  days were analyzed. An extensive battery of laboratory measurements were available. Dose adjustment was performed empirically using trough levels (C(min)). The population was separated into two major background groups according to low or high values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Group 1 and 2, respectively) based on AST measurements made during the first 4 days post-LTx. Each of these two major groups was then further subdivided into two subgroups based on elevated (Groups 1A, 2A) or reduced (Groups 1B, 2B) combined albumin (cut-off 2.5 g/dl) and hematocrit (cut-off 28%). RESULTS: The C(min)/Dose ratio [inversely proportional to systemic clearance (CL)] had a variability [coefficient of variation (CV) >80%) that was incongruently higher for the ratio than for C(min) and Dose separately. This was attributed to most patients not being at steady state or physiologically stable in the early post-LTx period. Group 1 patients were more predictable than Group 2 patients, who were responsible for the variability in the ratio. C(min) was lower in the reduced ALB and HCT patient groups when AST conditions were similar (1A vs. 1B and 2A vs. 2B), likely due to increased TAC metabolic clearance (reduced C(min)/Dose). This situation existed for two periods: 0-15 days post-LTx and 4-15 days post-LTx observations. Group 2A patients were the main source of the paradoxical variability in C(min)/Dose (higher ratio of 2.7; CV   =   100%), suggesting a lower clearance and difficulty in the recovery of stability. In contrast, Group 2B patients had the lower ratio (1.4; 47%) but required the highest number of dose adjustments as the variability was hard to identify clinically. Group 1A patients were the most predictable empirically. When observations from 15 new patients who entered the clinic in 2007 and 2008 were used for the analysis, the same sub-groups existed in the same proportions in both years. CONCLUSION: The difficulty in empirical dose adjustment of TAC is associated to the inevitable non-fulfillment of PK assumptions early post-LTx and also to the inherent complexity of the clinical condition, leading to increased uncertainty for the clinician regarding dose selection. Identifying these sub-categories provides a rational means of classifying patients akin to a phenotype. The complexity of the kinetics in LTx and TAC treatment does not invalidate C(min) as a biomarker, but a Bayes algorithm including a full PK structure and these covariates would be optimal.

12018634|t|Mercury in dental restoration: is there a risk of nephrotoxicity?
12018634|a|BACKGROUND: Concern has been voiced about exposure to mercury (Hg) from dental amalgam fillings, and there is a need to assess whether this leads to signs of nephrotoxicity. METHODS: A total of 101 healthy adults (80 males and 21 females) were included in this study. The population as grouped into those having amalgam fillings (39 males and 10 females) and those without (41 males and 11 females). Hg was determined in blood, urine, hair and nails to assess exposure. Urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin (beta2M), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined as markers of tubular damage. Albuminuria was assayed as an early indicator of glomerular dysfunction. Serum creatinine, beta2M and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were determined to assess glomerular filtration. RESULTS: Hg levels in blood and urine were significantly higher in persons with dental amalgam than those without; in the dental amalgam group, blood and urine levels of Hg significantly correlated with the number of amalgams. Urinary excretion of NAG, gammaGT and albumin was significantly higher in persons with dental amalgam than those without. In the amalgam group, urinary excretion of NAG and albumin significantly correlated with the number of fillings. Albuminuria significantly correlated with blood and urine Hg. CONCLUSION: From the nephrotoxicity point of view, dental amalgam is an unsuitable filling material, as it may give rise to Hg toxicity. Hg levels in blood and urine are good markers of such toxicity. In these exposure conditions, renal damage is possible and may be assessed by urinary excretions of albumin, NAG, and gamma-GT.

8054689|t|Terminal differentiation and senescence in the human melanocyte: repression of tyrosine-phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 selectively defines the two phenotypes.
8054689|a|Melanocytes are pigmented cells distributed in humans in several organs like the epidermis, the leptomeninges, the eye, and the inner ear. Epidermal melanocytes, whether derived from adult or neonatal skin, proliferate well in a medium supplemented with phorbol esters and other mitogens before they undergo senescence. Potent cAMP inducers like cholera toxin are also growth promoters for neonatal melanocytes but only transient growth stimulators for cells derived from adults. We used this cellular system to delineate biochemical pathways involved in proliferation and in terminal differentiation. Here we show that after a period of 4-8 wk of sustained proliferation in the presence of cholera toxin, the adult melanocytes became round, flat, and enlarged. These changes were associated with terminal growth and preceded by a five- to sixfold increase in cAMP levels and an 8- to 10-fold increase in melanin content. The simultaneous addition of phorbol esters and cholera toxin did not prevent cells from reaching terminal differentiation. Identified targets for phorbol esters are protein kinase C (PKC) and the mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), also called extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). PKC was found to be similarly regulated in proliferating and in terminally differentiated melanocytes. Proliferating melanocytes in early or late passage showed identical activation of the kinase ERK2. This kinase was rapidly phosphorylated upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) addition and specifically accumulated in the nucleus of the cells, whereas in unstimulated cells it had a perinuclear distribution. In contrast, senescent and terminally differentiated cells were unable to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of the ERK2 gene product in spite of presenting normal amounts of ERK2 protein. In addition, ERK2 did not show the nuclear accumulation observed in proliferating melanocytes after PMA activation and remained localized in the perinuclear area. These results demonstrate that senescent and terminally differentiated melanocytes share a common block in a critical pathway thought to integrate multiple intracellular signals transmitted by various second messengers and specifically prevent the continuation of the signal transduction cascade initiated by PMA activation of PKC.

24148751|t|New stent surface materials: the impact of polymer-dependent interactions of human endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and platelets.
24148751|a|Despite the development of new coronary stent technologies, in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis are still clinically relevant. Interactions of blood and tissue cells with the implanted material may represent an important cause of these side effects. We hypothesize material-dependent interaction of blood and tissue cells. The aim of this study is accordingly to investigate the impact of vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and platelets with various biodegradable polymers to identify a stent coating or platform material that demonstrates excellent endothelial-cell-supportive and non-thrombogenic properties. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells, human coronary arterial endothelial cells and human coronary arterial smooth muscle cells were cultivated on the surfaces of two established biostable polymers used for drug-eluting stents, namely poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) (PEVA) and poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA). We compared these polymers to new biodegradable polyesters poly(l-lactide) (PLLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB)), poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) (P(4HB)) and a polymeric blend of PLLA/P(4HB) in a ratio of 78/22% (w/w). Biocompatibility tests were performed under static and dynamic conditions. Measurement of cell proliferation, viability, glycocalix width, eNOS and PECAM-1 mRNA expression revealed strong material dependency among the six polymer samples investigated. Only the polymeric blend of PLLA/P(4HB) achieved excellent endothelial markers of biocompatibility. Data show that PLLA and P(4HB) tend to a more thrombotic response, whereas the polymer blend is characterized by a lower thrombotic potential. These data demonstrate material-dependent endothelialization, smooth muscle cell growth and thrombogenicity. Although polymers such as PEVA and PBMA are already commonly used for vascular implants, they did not sufficiently meet the criteria for biocompatibility. The investigated biodegradable polymeric blend PLLA/P(4HB) evidently represents a promising material for vascular stents and stent coatings.

20205392|t|Discovery, biological evaluation, and structure-activity relationship of amidine based sphingosine kinase inhibitors.
20205392|a|Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent phospholipid growth and trophic factor, is synthesized in vivo by two sphingosine kinases. Thus these kinases have been proposed as important drug targets for treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and inflammation. We report here a new class of amidine-based sphingosine analogues that are competitive inhibitors of sphingosine kinases exhibiting varying degrees of enzyme selectivity. These inhibitors display K(I) values in the submicromolar range for both sphingosine kinases and, in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, decrease S1P levels and initiate growth arrest.

8263129|t|Androgens regulate proliferation of human prostate cancer cells in culture by increasing transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)/TGF-alpha receptor.
8263129|a|Androgens affect growth of the prostate gland and many prostate cancers. Androgens could mediate their mitogenic effects on prostate cells by an autocrine loop involving epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha that bind to the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor. We examined the effects of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T), EGF, and EGF-alpha on cell proliferation and 3H-thymidine incorporation in an androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line, ALVA101, in serum-free medium. The regulation of TGF-alpha and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined by Northern blot analysis and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor protein by immunoblot. After 24 h of treatment of ALVA101 cells with DHT (10(-8) M) or T (10(-8) M), TGF-alpha mRNA levels increased 3- and 2.5-fold, respectively, and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor mRNA levels 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Cell numbers increased at day 5 in response to 10(-8) M DHT (18%, P < 0.01), 10(-8) M T (15%, P < 0.01), 20 ng/ml EGF (16%, P < 0.01), and 50 ng/mL TGF-alpha (34%, P < 0.01). DHT combined with TGF-alpha or T combined with EGF increased cell number 43% and 40% above control, respectively (P < 0.01 vs. DHT, P < 0.05 vs. TGF-alpha, T, EGF alone). The anti-EGF/TGF-alpha receptor antibody (528) blocked the cell proliferation induced by either DHT or TGF-alpha. We conclude that DHT and T stimulate synthesis of TGF-alpha and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor mRNAs and EGF/TGF-alpha receptor content in ALVA101 cells. This mitogenic effect of androgen on ALVA101 cells may involve TGF-alpha and the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor autocrine loop.

22126730|t|Cost-effectiveness evaluation of sunitinib as first-line targeted therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Spain.
22126730|a|INTRODUCTION Sunitinib, an oral, multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, delays disease progression, with a median overall survival (OS) of more than 2 years, improves quality of life and is becoming the first-line standard of care for metastatic renal carcinoma (mRCC). PURPOSE To assess the economic value of sunitinib as fi rst-line therapy in mRCC within the Spanish healthcare system. METHODS An adapted Markov model with a 10-year time horizon was used to analyse the cost effectiveness of sunitinib vs. sorafenib (SFN) and bevacizumab/interferon-a (BEV/IFN) as first-line mRCC therapy from the Spanish third-party payer perspective. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS data from sunitinib, SFN and BEV/IFN pivotal trials were extrapolated to project survival and costs in 6-week cycles. Results, in progression-free life-years (PFLY), life years (LY) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) with costs and benefits discounted annually at 3%, were obtained using deterministic and probabilistic analyses. RESULTS Sunitinib was more effective and less costly than both SFN (gains of 0.52 PFLY, 0.16 LY, 0.17 QALY) and BEV/IFN (gains of 0.19 PFLY, 0.23 LY, 0.16 QALY) with average cost savings/patients of  ¬1,124 and  ¬23,218, respectively. Using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of  ¬50,000/QALY, sunitinib achieved an incremental net benefit (INB) of  ¬9,717 and  ¬31,211 compared with SFN and BEV/IFN, respectively. At this WTP, the probability of sunitinib providing the highest INB was 75%. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that sunitinib is a costeffective alternative to other targeted therapies as first-line mRCC therapy in the Spanish healthcare setting.

7656119|t|Clinical effect of converting antidepressant therapy from fluoxetine to sertraline.
7656119|a|The effect of replacing fluoxetine with sertraline at two dosage-conversion ratios was studied. Outpatients at a Veterans Affairs mental health clinic who were being treated with fluoxetine were randomly assigned to receive either 50 or 75 mg of sertraline hydrochloride for every 20 mg of fluoxetine (as the hydrochloride salt) or to continue to receive their current dosage of fluoxetine. The subjects were given the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline and were re-examined at one-month intervals for three months with the HDRS and BDI and the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Each patient was re-evaluated by the same blinded investigator. A total of 45 patients (42 men and 3 women) completed the study. The final overall response did not differ significantly among the three groups. There were also no significant differences among the groups in the proportions of patients with HDRS and BDI scores classified as improving, worsening, or not changing. Improvement was more common in patients receiving the higher dosage of sertraline. Few adverse effects were reported. Outpatients receiving fluoxetine were switched to sertraline therapy without a loss of control of depression and without substantial adverse effects.

18258348|t|Risperidone and liver function tests in children and adolescents: a short-term prospective study.
18258348|a|OBJECTIVE: Revealing of unknown adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics on pediatric population may take a long period of time. The purpose of this prospective study is to document changes in the liver function tests (LFTs) associated with risperidone usage in a group of children and adolescents. METHOD: Study subjects consist of 120 youths with ages ranging from 3-17 years. For this study, patients' baseline and follow-up weight and hepatobiliary function tests including alanine aminotransferases(ALT) and aspartat aminotransferases (AST), gamma gluatamyl transerase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin levels were measured before and after the treatment period of one month. RESULTS: Only one male patient's ALT levels increased up to three-fold and AST levels increased up to two-fold of the basal levels. First month mean levels of liver enzymes and billuribin of the patients were significantly higher than the baseline. Sixty-three patients (52.5%) showed an asymptomatic increase in the liver enzymes and/or billuribin levels of the first month of this study. Weight gain was observed in 58 patients (57.4%). There was no significant association between changes in weight and liver enzymes and billuribin levels. CONCLUSION: We found clinically non significant liver function test abnormalities mostly in the form of ALP elevation in 52.5% and marked liver enzymes elevation in 0.8% of risperidone-treated subjects. However use of concomitant medications and variations in age are the limitations of this study. These findings suggest that risperidone treatment in the short term may lead to liver function changes in children and adolescents.

22894666|t|Vismodegib: a promising drug in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas.
22894666|a|Hedgehog pathway signaling is important for embryonic development; however, inappropriate reactivation of this pathway in adults has been linked to several forms of cancer. Vismodegib (Erivedge ¢), a first-in-class hedgehog pathway inhibitor, blocks the pathway by inhibiting the activity of the signaling protein SMO. Preclinical studies have provided promising indications of potential tumor-reducing activity in several cancers. Thus far, clinical pharmacology and Phase I studies have demonstrated the unique pharmacokinetic profile of vismodegib, its efficacy in certain types of tumors and a generally tolerable adverse-event profile. A pivotal Phase II clinical trial confirmed the favorable benefit:risk profile of vismodegib in advanced basal cell carcinoma.

18499421|t|Oxidative stress response in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis: assessing catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase.
18499421|a|Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that infects humans and establishes infection in the yeast form. We are interested in the mechanisms this fungus uses to evade the human immune system, and in its survival strategies within infected host cells. Reactive oxygen species play an important role in host defence, but are detoxified by pathogen-derived antioxidant enzymes to prevent oxidative damage. The transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of P. brasiliensis catalase and cytochrome-c peroxidase (CCP) antioxidant enzymes upon culture treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is described. High H(2)O(2) concentrations (up to 100 mm) still permitted 70-100% survival of exponential and stationary phase yeast cells, though stationary phase cells were consistently more resistant. P. brasiliensis has both cytosolic and peroxisomal catalase isoenzymes and a single cytochrome-c peroxidase. High-dose treatments with H(2)O(2) led to an early increase in total catalase and CCP enzymatic activities, indicative of post-transcriptional regulation. The expression levels of the catalase genes increased three to fourfold when the cells were treated with 50 mm H(2)O(2) for 40 or 50 min. Lipid peroxidation, as assessed by the thiobarbituric acid method, was relatively low upon treatment with H(2)O(2), which was consistent with our results demonstrating that P. brasiliensis has a powerful antioxidant defence system enabling it to survive H(2)O(2)-mediated stress.

15328104|t|Paradoxical effect of caspofungin: reduced activity against Candida albicans at high drug concentrations.
15328104|a|Resistance problems with caspofungin, an echinocandin inhibitor of fungal cell wall glucan synthesis, have been rare. We noted paradoxical turbid growth of Candida albicans isolates in broth in some high (supra-MIC) concentrations. Among isolates submitted for susceptibility testing and screened at drug concentrations up to 12.5 microg/ml, the frequency was 16%. Analysis of the turbid growth indicated slowing of growth in the presence of drug but with numbers of CFU up to 72% those of drug-free controls. Clearing of growth again by the highest drug concentrations produced a quadriphasic pattern in a tube dilution series. Cells growing at high drug concentrations were not resistant on retesting but showed the paradoxical effect of the parent. Among a selected series of isolates tested at concentrations up to 50 microg/ml, an additional 53% showed a "mini-paradoxical effect": no turbid growth but incomplete killing at high concentrations (supra-minimum fungicidal concentration). These effects were reproducible; medium dependent in extent; noted in macro- and microdilution, in the presence or absence of serum, and on agar containing drug (but not when drug concentrations were not constant, as in agar diffusion); not seen with other echinocandins and less commonly in other Candida species; and not due to destruction of drug in tubes showing the effect. Cooperative enhancement of inhibition by a second drug could eradicate the effect. We postulate that high drug concentrations derepress or activate resistance mechanisms. The abilities of subpopulations to survive at high drug concentrations could have in vivo consequences.

9240009|t|Itraconazole for treatment of oral candidosis in pediatric cancer patients.
9240009|a|Oral candidosis commonly occurs in malignancy children undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy. Inadequate response to antifungal treatment leads to a risk of disseminated infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of itraconazole on treatment of oral candidosis. Fourteen children with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy received itraconazole 100-200 mg/day for 10 days to treat oral candidosis. The severity of disease was defined as mild and moderate depending on the number of lesions and symptoms. Oropharyngeal lesions and symptoms were recorded initially and daily. Blood chemistries were done on day 0, day 10 and day 16. The overall response rate was 87.5 per cent. The mild group (4 cases) had a response rate of 100 per cent which had lesions and symptoms resolved on day 2 and day 1.5 +/- 0.7 respectively. The moderate group (10 cases) had 8 responders (80%) whose lesions and symptoms resolved on day 6 +/- 2.5 and day 4.1 +/- 2.3 respectively. Side effects and abnormal blood chemistry values. were not seen.

17668253|t|In vitro activity of temocillin against prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing Enterobacteriaceae from Belgian intensive care units.
17668253|a|Temocillin is a narrow spectrum penicillin with high stability to most beta-lactamases including AmpC types and extended-spectrum types (ESBLs). We have analysed its in vitro activity against 652 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae prospectively collected from patients hospitalised in intensive care units at seven different university hospitals in Belgium in 2005. Strains were screened for ESBL production using cefotaxime and ceftazidime screen agar plates and by double ESBL E-tests. The MIC of temocillin and of five comparators was determined using the E-test method. ESBLs were characterized at one central laboratory by isoelectric focusing, PCR for bla genes of the SHV, TEM, and CTX-M families, and by DNA sequencing. The prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae averaged 11.8% and ranged between 3.0 and 29% in the different hospitals. Meropenem exhibited the highest in vitro activity overall (mode MIC 0.064 microg; MIC(90); 0.19 microg/ml), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90) > 256 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) > 32 microg/ml) scored the worst. Temocillin was active against more than 90% of the isolates including most AmpC- and ESBL-producing isolates. These data indicate the well preserved activity of temocillin over the years against Enterobacteriaceae and show the wide variation in prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Belgian intensive care units. Prospective clinical studies are, however, needed to validate the usefulness of temocillin in the treatment of microbiologically documented infections caused by ESBL- and/or AmpC- overproducing nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae pathogens.

24369409|t|The paradigm of universal access to HIV-treatment and human rights violation: how do we treat HIV-positive people who use drugs?
24369409|a|HIV-positive people who use drugs (PWUDs) are particularly vulnerable for suboptimal access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We conducted a systematic review to identify factors associated with suboptimal HAART access among this population. Studies evaluating HAART access among active PWUDs as a primary outcome, presenting multivariate analysis and conducted after January 1997 were included. Of 122 studies matching the search criteria, only 14 (11.4  %) met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were prospective cohorts and included young adults, 13 were conducted in North America or western Europe and one in Ukraine. Selected studies measured HAART access using different strategies, however, all identified PWUDs as less likely to receive HAART, when compared to those who never used drugs or former PWUDs. Additional factors associated with suboptimal HAART access include: recent incarceration, lack of health insurance, unstable housing, depression, non-white ethnicity, female PWUDs, and health professionals stigma/prejudice. Factors associated with higher rates of HIV-treatment access included: alcohol and/or drug addiction treatment (especially methadone maintenance therapy), regular source of primary care, treatment and care from the same provider (most of the time) and larger physician experience in HIV-management. PWUDs face a synergy of social and structural factors that influence their suboptimal access to HAART, struggling with poor living conditions, inadequate access to specialized care and stigma/discrimination from health professionals. Renewed strategies and effective interventions should be developed and scaled-up, in order to assure equitable HAART access, decrease morbidity and mortality among PWUDs.

12204484|t|Role of COX-2 inhibitors in the evolution of acute pain management.
12204484|a|Management of acute postoperative pain remains suboptimal: nearly 80% of patients report moderate to extreme pain following surgery. New pain management paradigms incorporate multimodal analgesia, using a combination of analgesics throughout the perioperative period to control nociceptive and centrally-stimulated pain. Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a role in postoperative pain management, but concerns about increased bleeding and inhibited wound healing and bone fusion have limited their use. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) offer the peripheral pain-relieving benefits of nonselective NSAIDs but with fewer adverse GI effects; they also may have a role in central sensitization. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and rofecoxib for postoperative pain and for preemptive analgesia, and newer agents such as valdecoxib and etoricoxib also have demonstrated efficacy in these settings. In addition to their selectivity for the COX-2 isozyme overall, unique differences among the coxibs, such as in plasma half-life, may impart certain clinical advantages.

9929763|t|Intrapericardial treatment of inflammatory and neoplastic pericarditis guided by pericardioscopy and epicardial biopsy--results from a pilot study.
9929763|a|From a registry of 136 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis, 14 patients with autoimmune and 15 patients with neoplastic effusions were selected. All underwent pericardioscopy, epicardial and pericardial biopsy with histologic, immunohistologic, and polymerase chain reaction/or in situ hybridization analysis for microbial DNAs and RNA. Pericardioscopy identified neoplastic effusions by the high occurrence of protrusions. Fibrin threads and layers and neovascularization were found in both groups. For identification of the inflammatory and neoplastic process, the combined analysis of the cytology of the effusion and epicardial biopsy evaluation proved to be most important. Epicardial biopsy demonstrated a slightly higher sensitivity for identifying neoplastic disorders in the pericardium than cytology alone. Pericardial biopsy was inconclusive. Intrapericardial administration of 1 g of crystalloid triamcinolone in autoreactive pericarditis prevented recurrence in 13 of the 14 cases after 3 months and in 12 of the 14 cases after 1 year. In neoplastic effusion, intrapericardial administration of 50 mg cis-platin for 24 h prevented recurrence of a hemodynamically relevant effusion after 3 months in all, and after 6-12 months in 14 of 15 patients. Mortality in neoplastic effusion due to noncardiac tumor progression was 47 and 80%, respectively, after 3 and 6 months, as can be expected in endstage neoplastic disease. This pilot study demonstrates that local drug application is feasible, life-saving, and well tolerated by the patients. It opens perspectives for local drug application in other cardiac disorders as well.

21553813|a|Streptomyces sp. strain C34, isolated from soil collected in the Chilean hyper-arid Atacama Desert, was cultured on different media, resulting in the isolation and identification of four new ansamycin-type polyketides. The organism was selected for chemical investigation on the basis of a genome-mining PCR-based experiment targeting the gene encoding rifamycin-specific 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthetase (AHBA). The isolated compounds were structurally characterized using NMR and MS techniques and named chaxamycins A-D (1-4). Compounds 1-4 were tested for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and for their ability to inhibit the intrinsic ATPase activity of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Chaxamycin D (4), which showed a selective antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923, was tested further against a panel of MRSA clinical isolates. In a virtual screening experiment, chaxamycins A-D (1-4) have also been docked into the ATP-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of the Hsp90, and the observed interactions are discussed.

7671566|t|Effect of dietary salt restriction on renal sensitivity to vasopressin in man.
7671566|a|1. We have previously described a progressive antidiuresis in response to low-dose vasopressin infusion during salt restriction in man, despite stable or even declining plasma vasopressin concentration. In the present study we examine the hypothesis that renal sensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin may be enhanced by salt restriction. 2. Extremely low-dose infusions of arginine vasopressin were given to normal subjects after equilibration to high (260 mmol/day) and low (20 mmol/day) sodium intakes. 3. Salt restriction increased the antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin (2 fmol min-1 kg-1 arginine vasopressin increased urine osmolality from 67.8 +/- 2.6 to 196.3 +/- 35.7 mosmol/l in the high-salt study and from 268.3 +/- 49 mosmol/l in the low-salt study; P < 0.05 between sodium intakes). Glomerular filtration rate, estimated from inulin clearance, was unchanged during arginine vasopressin infusion irrespective of salt intake (high salt 116.5 +/- 9.4 to 118.9 +/- 6.4 ml/min; low salt, 135.1 +/- 9.2 to 111.2 +/- 12.4 ml/min). Renal plasma flow, estimated from para-aminohippurate clearance, fell further during infusion of 2 fmol min-1 kg-1 arginine vasopressin in the low-salt study than in the high-salt study (low salt, from 555.7 +/- 22.7 to 298.3 +/- 27.6 ml/min; high salt, from 544.5 +/- 30.2 to 452.9 +/- 28.9 ml/min; P < 0.05 between sodium intakes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

12573058|t|Treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16-infected cells using herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase-mediated gene therapy transcriptionally regulated by the HPV E2 protein.
12573058|a|Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with development of anogenital squamous cell cancers (SCCs) and their precursor, intraepithelial neoplasia (IN). Few approaches to the treatment of IN to prevent SCC are targeted specifically to HPV. We have designed an HPV-specific therapy using the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK) gene driven by an HPV-specific promoter in the HPV-16 long control region (LCR) (nucleotide 7450-nucleotide 104), which is regulated by the HPV E2 protein. Expression of the HSV-1 TK gene is designed to render HPV-infected cells sensitive to the prodrugs ganciclovir (GCV) and acyclovir (ACV). To assess the E2 specificity of gene expression driven by the HPV-16 LCR, we measured luciferase expression in HPV-positive and HPV-negative cell lines. Significant induction of luciferase activity was observed in HPV-positive cells when compared with four different HPV-negative epithelial cell lines. Cotransfection of an HPV-negative cell line, MDCK, with an HPV-16 E2-expressing plasmid resulted in 15- to 20-fold induction of luciferase activity, suggesting specific activation by E2 protein. A plasmid expressing the HSV-1 TK gene driven by the LCR was transfected into CaSki and SiHa cells. Treatment of transfected cells with either GCV or ACV (20-30 microg/ml) for 6-10 days resulted in 80-95% cell death. Cell death was progressive, dose dependent, and mediated by apoptosis. These results suggest that direct gene transfer of the HSV-1 TK gene into HPV-16-infected cells expressing E2 protein, accompanied by treatment with either GCV or ACV, may be a clinically feasible therapeutic strategy.

8998955|t|An analysis of nasal irritation thresholds using a new solvation equation.
8998955|a|In the present paper we have developed a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) equation for nasal pungency caused by nonreactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Our QSAR was developed upon previously published nasal pungency thresholds in anosmics, i.e., patients lacking a sense of smell and thus responding only to sensory irritation evoked by trigeminal nerve stimulation. The reported solvation equation, which fits the data with considerable precision, describes sensory potency in terms of interaction via electron pairs, dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity, and hydrophobicity. It correspondingly suggests relevant physicochemical properties of the biophase where the sensory response is brought about. The equation implies that in the range of molecular size where nonreactive VOCs can produce any pungency, transport from the air to the biophase strictly determines potency. In this respect, the potency of nasal pungency shares characteristics with the ability of VOCs to cause narcosis and anesthesia.

22494568|t|Pharmacological and genetic interventions in serotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors to alter drug abuse and dependence processes.
22494568|a|The present review provides an overview on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)(2C) receptors and their relationship to drug dependence. We have focused our discussion on the impact of 5-HT(2C) receptors on the effects of different classes of addictive drugs, illustrated by reference to data using pharmacological and genetic tools. The neurochemical mechanism of the interaction between 5-HT(2C) receptors, with focus on the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, and drugs of abuse (using cocaine as an example) is discussed. Finally, we integrate recent nonclinical and clinical research and information with marketed products possessing 5-HT(2C) receptor binding affinities. Accordingly, available nonclinical data and some clinical observations targeting 5-HT(2C) receptors may offer innovative translational strategies for combating drug dependence.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Brain Integration.

21128326|t|Antimicrobial susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from patients in Shiraz, Southern Iran.
21128326|a|AIM: To improve our understanding of Iranian regional variation in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antibiotic resistance rates to find the best antibiotic therapy for eradication of H. pylori infections. METHODS: A total of 266 patients undergoing endoscopy in Shiraz, Southern Iran, were included in this study. H. pylori strains were isolated from antral biopsies by culture and confirmed by the rapid urease-test and gram staining. Antibiotic susceptibility of H. pylori isolates was determined by E-test. RESULTS: A total of 121 H. pylori strains were isolated, 50 from male and 71 from female patients. Data showed that 44% (n = 53), 20% (n = 24), 5% (n = 6), and 3% (n = 4) of all strains were resistant to the antibiotics metronidazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and tetracycline, respectively. When the antibiotics were considered together we found 11 sensitivity patterns for the strains. Resistance to metronidazole was significantly higher in female than in male patients (P < 0.05). In about 71% of the metronidazole-resistant isolates, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) exceeded 256 µg/mL. CONCLUSION: We found a moderate rate of primary resistance to metronidazole. However, a high MIC (> 256 mg/L) which was found in 71% of the isolates is considerable. In the case of amoxicillin, an increased resistance rate of 20% is worrying. Resistance to clarithromycin and tetracycline is also emerging among the H. pylori strains in our region.

17898951|t|Effects of bushen tiaochong recipe containing serum on ovarian granulosa cell proliferation, steroidogenesis and associated gene expression in rats.
17898951|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of bushen tiaochong recipe (BSTCR) on rats' ovarian granulosa cell (GC) proliferation, steroidogenesis and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression using serum pharmacological method. METHODS: Rats' GCs were incubated with 10% blank serum (as negative control group), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-containing serum (S-FSH, as positive control group), or BSTCR (in different dosages) containing serum (S-BSTCR, as the BSTCR groups) for 48 h. 3H-TdR incorporation was then performed; DNA was measured to analyze the distribution of GCs in the cell cycle and their proliferation index (PI) using a flow cytometer; estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) content in the culture fluid were examined by radioimmunoassay; and levels of FSHR and IGF-1 mRNA expression in GCs were measured by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: A dose-dependent increase of 3H-TdR incorporation in GC was shown in the BSTCR groups. Cells in G0/G1 phase had markedly less, while those in S phase had a significantly higher increase in the BSTCR groups compared with the negative control group. A high value of PI was also shown in the BSTCR groups, especially in the high dose group where the influence of cell proliferation was stronger than that in the positive control group. The levels of E2 and P in the BSTCR groups of all dosages were significantly higher than those in the negative control group, and did not show any significant difference compared with those in the positive control group. Levels of FSHR and IGF-1 mRNA expression in the BSTCR groups increased in a dose-dependent manner at levels higher than those in the negative control group. CONCLUSION: S-BSTCR can obviously stimulate the proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovarian GCs. It is speculated that BSTCR could play a regulatory action on ovarian function through two different pathways of endocrine and autocrine by promoting FSHR and IGF-1 mRNA expression.

19732311|t|Vardenafil allows successful intercourse initiated rapidly after dosing in Japanese patients with diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction.
19732311|a|INTRODUCTION: Vardenafil is reported to improve success rates in the maintenance of an erection sufficient for completion of intercourse (SEP-3) compared with placebo in erectile dysfunction (ED) patients who attempted intercourse from as early as 15 minutes after dosing. However, these data were based on general ED patients, using time from administration to initiation of intercourse. It is unclear whether the results can be applied to difficult-to-treat ED patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM), with the time between dosing and insertion into vagina. AIM: To determine whether early onset of activity with vardenafil is also achievable in ED patients with DM. METHODS: Data from a 12-week Phase III clinical trial (randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison) in Japanese men with ED and DM was used for analysis. In this study, patients received vardenafil 10 mg, 20 mg, or placebo, and were instructed to start sexual activity 1 hour after dosing. Mean per-patient SEP-3 success rates (intent-to-treat; ITT population), based on patient diary question, were calculated by the time between dosing and insertion. The least-squares means and nominal P values for differences versus placebo were derived by analysis of covariance with terms for baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SEP-3 success rates in each time interval. RESULTS: The majority of inserts occurred between 60-90 minutes after dosing, but 100 of inserts in 52 patients occurred in the first 30 minutes. SEP-3 success rates in patients who inserted in each interval from 0-15 minutes (P = 0.0268), 15-30 minutes (P = 0.0094) through > 120 minutes were all higher in vardenafil-treated patients than those in placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, a rapid onset of activity was also demonstrated in difficult-to-treat ED patients. Vardenafil improved successful intercourse rates compared with placebo in Japanese DM patients who inserted from as early as 15 minutes to >120 minutes after dosing.

2303641|t|Therapy of refractory symptomatic atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter: a staged care approach with new antiarrhythmic drugs.
2303641|a|One hundred nine patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter, or both, who had failed one to five previous antiarrhythmic drug trials were treated with propafenone and, subsequently, sotalol if atrial fibrillation recurred. The clinical profile of the study group was as follows: age 63 +/- 13 years, left atrial anteroposterior dimension 4.4 +/- 0.9 cm and left ventricular ejection fraction 57 +/- 14%. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurred in 56 patients (51%) and chronic atrial fibrillation occurred in 53 patients (49%). After loading and dose titration phases were completed, the maintenance doses of drugs were 450 to 900 mg/day for propafenone and 160 to 960 mg/day for sotalol. Life table estimates of the duration of freedom from atrial fibrillation were constructed for each drug trial. The percent of patients free of recurrent symptomatic arrhythmia at 6 months was 39% for propafenone and 50% for sotalol. The cumulative proportion of patients successfully treated with propafenone or sotalol, or both, by 6 months was 55% and remained relatively constant beyond that point. The incidence of intolerable side effects necessitating discontinuation of therapy ranged from 7% to 8%. Thus, despite previous unsuccessful drug trials, a substantial proportion of patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation refractory to conventional therapy can be treated successfully and safely with newer antiarrhythmic drugs. Treatment failures tend to occur early in the course of follow-up, permitting easy identification of candidates for alternative therapeutic approaches.

22059896|t|Determination of the antioxidative activity of substituted 5-aminopyrimidines.
22059896|a|The aminopyrimidine structural motif can be found in diverse biologically active compounds. This study aimed to describe the antioxidant activity of a series of di- and tri-substituted 5-aminopyrimidines using in vitro (TEAC, LPO) and cell-based assays. 2,4,6-trisubstituted 5-aminopyrimidines displayed the highest activity in the TEAC and LPO assays whereas compounds with protected 5-aminogroup were active in the cellular assay. This is most likely because of their better membrane permeability and intracellular metabolic activation. In summary, we have identified the antioxidant activity of a series of substituted 5-aminopyrimidines and their potential prodrugs which may have implications in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.

10986211|t|Increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in inflammatory bowel disease patients on immunosuppressive therapy but overall risk is low.
10986211|a|BACKGROUND: There is concern that the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) will rise with increasing use of immunosuppressive therapy. AIMS: Our aim was to determine the risk of NHL in a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study the association between IBD, NHL, and immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: We studied 782 IBD patients (238 of whom received immunosuppressive therapy) who attended our medical centre between 1990 and 1999 (median follow up 8.0 years). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Expected cases were derived from 1995 age and sex specific incidence rates recorded by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland. RESULTS: There were four cases of NHL in our IBD cohort (SIR 31.2; 95% CI 2.0-85; p=0.0001), all of whom had received immunosuppressive therapy: azathioprine (n=2), methotrexate (n=1), and methotrexate and cyclosporin (n=1). Our immunosuppressive group had a significantly (59 times) higher risk of NHL compared with that expected in the general population (p=0.0001). Three cases were intestinal NHL and one was mesenteric. Mean age at NHL diagnosis was 49 years, mean duration of IBD at the time of NHL diagnosis was 3.1 years, and mean duration between initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and diagnosis of NHL was 20 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although underlying IBD may be a causal factor in the development of intestinal NHL, our experience suggests that immunosuppressive drugs can significantly increase the risk of NHL in IBD. This must be weighed against the improved quality of life and clinical benefit immunosuppressive therapy provides for IBD patients.

1987005|t|Salt and hypertension--future directions.
1987005|a|The comments that follow reflect the personal views of this author regarding some useful directions of research in the field of salt and hypertension. From a physiological perspective, salt sensitivity is defined, and the merits and limitations of certain animal models of hypertension used to study this issue are discussed. The need to more clearly define the mechanisms that detect sodium intake and control the renal excretion of sodium is discussed. Additionally, the need to better understand the relation between sodium homeostasis, volume regulation, and the consequences of dysfunction in these regulatory system on the arterial vasculature and interstitial matrix is emphasized. The necessity for the application of new tools and approaches in a number of investigative areas is discussed. Finally, the necessity of equally imaginative whole animal and cell/molecular research and efforts to merge and integrate the data obtained at the cellular level with that of intact systems is emphasized.

18759291|t|Extracellular high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 is a coupling factor for hypoxia and inflammation in arthritis.
18759291|a|OBJECTIVE: Tissue hypoxia is closely associated with arthritis pathogenesis, and extracellular high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB-1) released from injured cells also has a role in arthritis development. This study was thus undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that extracellular HMGB-1 may be a coupling factor between hypoxia and inflammation in arthritis. METHODS: Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, and HMGB-1 were measured in synovial fluid (SF) samples from patients with inflammatory arthropathy (rheumatoid arthritis and pseudogout) and patients with noninflammatory arthropathy (osteoarthritis). The localization of tissue hypoxia and HMGB-1 was also examined in animal models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In cell-based experiments, the effects of hypoxia on HMGB-1 release and its associated cellular events (i.e., protein distribution and cell viability) were studied. RESULTS: In SF samples from patients with HMGB-1-associated inflammatory arthropathy (i.e., samples with HMGB-1 levels >2 SD above the mean level in samples from patients with noninflammatory arthropathy), concentrations of HMGB-1 were significantly correlated with those of lactic acid, a marker of tissue hypoxia. In CIA models in which the pathologic phenotype could be attenuated by HMGB-1 neutralization, colocalization of HMGB-1 with tissue hypoxia in arthritis lesions was also observed. In cell-based experiments, hypoxia induced significantly increased levels of extracellular HMGB-1 by the cellular processes of secretion and/or apoptosis-associated release, which was much more prominent than the protein release in necrotic cell injury potentiated by oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that tissue hypoxia and its resultant extracellular HMGB-1 might play an important role in the development of arthritis.

23469567|t|Clinical profile of multiple myeloma and effect of thalidomide based treatment on its outcome.
23469567|a|Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that leads to bone pain, pathological fracture, anaemia, renal failure and recurrent bacterial infections. Recently, thalidomide has demonstrated significant activity in the treatment of multiple myeloma in various western studies. In India there are very minimal studies about multiple myeloma. To study the clinical profile of multiple myeloma and the effect of thalidomide based treatment on its outcome in the Indian scenario are the aims and objective of the study. A total of 25 multiple myeloma cases were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made based on the presence of greater than 10% plasma cells on bone marrow, an M band in serum electrophoresis and/or a skeletal survey revealing osteolytic lesions. All the above patients were treated with tablet thalidomide 200 mg once daily on all days and tablet dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20 in a 28 days cycle for 4 cycles. At the end of four cycles, all patients were re-evaluated and the response rate was assessed. The most common clinical presentation (56%) was bone related like bony swelling, bone pain, low backache and pathological fractures. The overall response rate to thal-dexa regimen was 72% (n=18). Out of these, 10 patients (56%) had complete response and 8 patients (44%) had partial response. The mean bone marrow plasma cell percentage at the end of therapy was 2% compared to 56% before therapy which was significant (p < 0.0001). None of the patients developed neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during treatment. Although multiple myeloma has remained an incurable disease to date, presently available thalidomide based combination chemotherapy represents an active inductive regimen to improve the outcome and achieve eventual cure.

17465452|t|Gastric digestion of pea ferritin and modulation of its iron bioavailability by ascorbic and phytic acids in caco-2 cells.
17465452|a|AIM: To understand the digestive stability and mechanism of release and intestinal uptake of pea ferritin iron in caco-2 cell line model. METHODS: Pea seed ferritin was purified using salt fractionation followed by gel filtration chromatography. The bioavailability of ferritin iron was assessed using coupled in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and phytic acid. Caco-2 cell ferritin formation was used as a surrogate marker of iron uptake. Structural changes of pea ferritin under simulated gastric pH were characterized using electrophoresis, gel filtration and circular dichroism spectroscopy. RESULTS: The caco-2 cell ferritin formation was significantly increased (P<0.001) with FeSO(4) (19.3 +/- 9.8 ng/mg protein) and pea ferritin (13.9 +/- 6.19 ng/mg protein) compared to the blank digest (3.7 +/- 1.8 ng/mg protein). Ascorbic acid enhanced while phytic acid decreased the pea ferritin iron bioavailability. However, either in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid, the ferritin content of caco-2 cells was significantly less with pea ferritin than with FeSO(4). At gastric pH, no band corresponding to ferritin was observed in the presence of pepsin either on native PAGE or SDS-PAGE. Gel filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a pH dependent loss of quaternary and secondary structure. CONCLUSION: Under gastric conditions, the iron core of pea ferritin is released into the digestive medium due to acid induced structural alterations and dissociation of protein. The released iron interacts with dietary factors leading to modulation of pea ferritin iron bioavailability, resembling the typical characteristics of non-heme iron.

21519310|t|Doppler measurement of the changes of fetal umbilical and middle cerebral artery velocimetric indices during continuous epidural labor analgesia.
21519310|a|OBJECTIVE: Although complications of the epidural technique are known to affect the fetus adversely, there are no data indicating that regional analgesia directly causes harmful effects to the fetus. Our purpose was to determine the effect of epidural labor analgesia on the Doppler velocimetric indices of the uterine and fetal umbilical and middle cerebral arteries. METHODS: Doppler velocimetry indices, systolic/diastolic ratios, pulsatility index, and resistance index, of the fetal umbilical artery and uterine artery were recorded in 15 women receiving continuous epidural analgesia with 0.075% bupivacaine and 0.0002% fentanyl during labor; the same indices were recorded of the fetal umbilical and middle cerebral arteries in 10 women receiving the same analgesia. The cerebroplacental Doppler ratio was calculated. Maternal and neonatal outcome data were also recorded. RESULTS: Velocimetric indices of the fetal umbilical and middle cerebral artery after epidural infusion were not significantly different from the pre-epidural infusion levels. Indices of the maternal uterine artery were significantly increased after epidural infusion. The cerebroplacental ratio did not change after the beginning of epidural infusion. Neonatal outcome parameters (1- and 5-min Apgar scores) were all within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that although velocimetric indices of the maternal uterine artery are affected by continuous epidural labor analgesia, fetal circulation, as measured by Doppler velocimetric indices, is not altered.

9372900|t|MUSE therapy: preliminary clinical observations.
9372900|a|OBJECTIVES: Intracavernosal injection of vasodilating agents has been a mainstay in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Recently, a transurethral delivery system (MUSE) for alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) was introduced as an alternative form of pharmacotherapy. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with erectile dysfunction were treated with MUSE in doses ranging from 125 to 1000 micrograms and their erections were observed in the clinical setting. All patients had previous intracavernosal injections of combination pharmacotherapy (papavarine, Regitine, and/or prostaglandin E1). RESULTS: Of these 100 patients that used MUSE, only 7% had well-sustained, rigid erections while 30% had full erections but with partial rigidity. The remaining 63% of patients did not achieve erections that they thought were adequate for penetration. Penile and/or perineal pain occurred in 24% of patients, 3% had a syncopal episode, and 3% experienced urethral bleeding. One patient had priapism that required drainage. Using intracavernosal injections, 49% had sustained rigid erections, 40% had full erections with partial rigidity, and 11% did not have a response satisfactory for penetration. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that intracavernosal injections appear to be more effective than MUSE in achieving a rigid erection in men with erectile dysfunction.

11148681|t|Drug resistance mechanisms in acute leukemia.
11148681|a|Markers of anticancer drug resistance are predictive of treatment response and outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Immunologic detection of the drug efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), correlate with functional assays of drug resistance. These accumulation defects also appear operable in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Many of the efflux pumps identified share significant structural homology with the large superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Other markers such as lung-resistance protein, bcl-2, and breast cancer-resistance protein, have been described in acute myeloid leukemia patients although their pathophysiology and clinical relevance are less clear and the methodology for their quantification are not well standardized. Preclinical studies have shown that small molecules capable of reversing efflux can restore drug sensitivity in resistant tumor models. Although initial clinical studies were limited by both potency and specificity of the reverser, later studies with more effective reversers have in many instances been limited by pharmacokinetic interactions exacerbating the clinical toxicities of chemotherapy. Although one large randomized study has demonstrated a proven survival advantage without increased toxicity using cyclosporine, the inconsistent results with other modulators raise doubt as to the utility and overall strategy of using drug efflux blockers in patients with established Pgp overexpression. Many of these patients have additional resistance mechanisms, and achieving meaningful clinical responses will likely require more complex clinical strategies. Preventing or delaying development of drug resistance in chemosensitive patients represents another therapeutic strategy to be tested.

21907743|t|Food intake, postprandial glucose, insulin and subjective satiety responses to three different bread-based test meals.
21907743|a|The effect of bread consumption on overall food intake is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to measure postprandial food intake after a set breakfast containing three different breads. Ten males and 10 females aged 20.1-44.8 years, BMI 18.4-24.8 kg/m(2), consumed two slices of White Bread, BÃ¼rgen Wholemeal and Seeds Bread or Lupin Bread (all 1300 kJ) with 10 g margarine and 30 g strawberry jam. Fullness and hunger responses and were measured before and during the test breakfasts. Glucose and insulin responses (incremental area under each two-hour curve (iAUC)) were calculated. Food intake was measured and energy and nutrient intake determined at a buffet meal two hours later. Subjects consumed significantly less energy after the BÃ¼rgen Bread meal compared to the White Bread meal (2548  ± 218 vs. 3040 ±328kJ, BÃ¼rgen Bread vs. White Bread, P<0.05). There were higher fullness responses for the Lupin Bread (P<0.01), and the BÃ¼rgen Bread (P<0.05) compared with the White Bread. Lupin Bread and BÃ¼rgen Bread produced smaller postprandial glucose responses (79  ± 7, 74  ± 4, 120  ± 10 mmol/L min iAUC, Lupin, BÃ¼rgen and White Bread respectively, P<0.01). Differences in insulin responses were also observed (6145  ± 1048, 6471  ± 976, 9674  ± 1431 pmol/L min iAUC, Lupin, BÃ¼rgen and White Bread respectively, P<0.01). Equal-energy portions of three different commercially available breads differed in their short-term satiation capacity. Further studies are needed to demonstrate any potential benefit for weight management.

22995726|t|Transfusion outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting treated with prasugrel or clopidogrel: TRITON-TIMI 38 retrospective data analysis.
22995726|a|OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding and associated transfusion is a concern with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The objective of the present study was to characterize a potential risk-adjusted difference in transfusion requirements between prasugrel and clopidogrel cohorts. METHODS: The data from 422 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from the TRial to assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by optimizing platelet InhibitioN with prasugrel Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: We found no difference in baseline transfusion risk scores between cohorts. As predicted, the number of units of red blood cells transfused perioperatively correlated with the transfusion risk score (P < .0001). Overall, the 12-hour chest tube drainage volumes and platelet transfusion rates in the prasugrel cohort were significantly greater. However, no statistically significant differences were found in the number of red blood cell transfusions, total hemostatic components transfused, or total blood donor exposure. A significantly greater number of platelet units were transfused postoperatively in the prasugrel patients who underwent surgery within 5 days or less after withdrawal of drug. In an analysis adjusted for the predicted risk of mortality, total donor exposure was not associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was associated with greater 12-hour chest tube drainage volumes and platelet transfusion rates but without any significant differences in red blood cell transfusions, total hemostatic components transfused, or total blood donor exposure.

1618256|t|Plasma thiamine concentrations after intramuscular and oral multiple dosage regimens in healthy men.
1618256|a|A novel liquid chromatographic method for the determination of thiamine in plasma has been developed and has been used to study plasma thiamine concentrations after multiple dosage regimens for 11 days. The method involves purification, concentration and analytical separation of thiochrome on-line, using a switching column system. Ten healthy men were given 500 mg thiamine i.m. once a day (Group 1) and ten were given 250 mg p.o. every 12 h (Group 2). The times to reach steady state (7 and 5.6 days for Groups 1 and 2, respectively) were not different (P greater than 0.05). The mean elimination half-life was 1.8 days. The mean minimum steady-state concentration after the oral regimen (23 micrograms.l-1) was 78% of that after the intramuscular regime (29 micrograms.l-1).

16800817|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha contributes to carbohydrate-induced transcriptional activation of hepatic fatty acid synthase.
16800817|a|Refeeding a carbohydrate-rich meal after a fast produces a co-ordinated induction of key glycolytic and lipogenic genes in the liver. The transcriptional response is mediated by insulin and increased glucose oxidation, and both signals are necessary for optimal induction of FAS (fatty acid synthase). The glucose-regulated component of FAS promoter activation is mediated in part by ChREBP [ChoRE (carbohydrate response element)-binding protein], which binds to a ChoRE between -7300 and -7000 base-pairs in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. Using in vivo footprinting with nuclei from fasted and refed rats, we identify an imperfect DR-1 (direct repeat-1) element between -7110 and -7090 bp that is protected upon carbohydrate refeeding. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays establish that this DR-1 element binds HNF-4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha), and chromatin immunoprecipitation establishes that HNF-4alpha binding to this site is increased approx. 3-fold by glucose refeeding. HNF-4alpha transactivates reporter constructs containing the distal FAS promoter in a DR-1-dependent manner, and this DR-1 is required for full glucose induction of the FAS promoter in primary hepatocytes. In addition, a 3-fold knockdown of hepatocyte HNF-4alpha by small interfering RNA produces a corresponding decrease in FAS gene induction by glucose. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a physical interaction between HNF-4alpha and ChREBP in primary hepatocytes, further supporting an important complementary role for HNF-4alpha in glucose-induced activation of FAS transcription. Taken together, these observations establish for the first time that HNF-4alpha functions in vivo through a DR-1 element in the distal FAS promoter to enhance gene transcription following refeeding of glucose to fasted rats. The findings support the broader view that HNF-4alpha is an integral component of the hepatic nutrient sensing system that co-ordinates transcriptional responses to transitions between nutritional states.

8660951|t|Complementation of Ah receptor deficiency in hepatoma cells: negative feedback regulation and cell cycle control by the Ah receptor.
8660951|a|The Ah receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor subunit that heterodimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) and mediates the predominant biological effects of 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD activates target genes in xenobiotica metabolism in many cell lines and, more specifically, delays G1-S progression of 5L hepatoma cells. Here we describe transient and stable AhR-expression analysis in AhR-deficient subclones of the TCDD-sensitive 5L cells. We tested the integrity of the AhR-signaling system beyond the lack of the receptor in the variant subclone and analyzed the role of AhR in cell cycle regulation. Transiently expressed AhR has a high basal activity on promoters containing AhR-binding sites, so-called XREs, when transfected into receptor-deficient variant cells compared to wild-type cells. Single- and double-hybrid analysis dissociates AhR ligand responsiveness, transactivation, and heterodimerization with Arnt from receptor binding to an XRE. Hybrid receptors also show the high basal activity in the absence of exogenous TCDD in AhR-deficient variant cells, indicating that the endogenous AhR-activating signal acts directly on the receptor rather than XRE-dependent promoters or DNA binding of the receptor. Stable expression of AhR in variant cell clones by retroviral infection fully reconstitutes TCDD responsiveness, including target-gene induction and delay of cell cycle progression. These AhR-reconstituted cells, like AhR-containing wild-type cells, show low basal activity of the transiently expressed AhR hybrid. Thus, the increased basal activity in AhR-deficient cells suggests a negative feedback control of AhR activity. In vitro ligand-binding assays are compatible with the idea that the increased basal activity is due to the accumulation of an AhR-binding endogenous ligand. In conclusion, AhR is causally responsible for TCDD-dependent cell cycle regulation and feedback control of AhR activity.

21701130|t|A cyanobacterial toxin, microcystin-LR, induces apoptosis of sertoli cells by changing the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins.
21701130|a|Toxic cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater have been considered as threats to human health. Microcystins are a family of cyclic polypeptides produced by cyanobacteria and are toxic to plants and animals. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most toxic variant among the microcystin family and could cause oxidative stress in various organs, including the reproduction system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of MC-LR on apoptosis of Sertoli cells that play an essential role in the development and maturation of sperm cells. Sertoli cells were isolated from healthy immature rats and cultured with MC-LR. The viability of Sertoli cells was decreased after treatment with MC-LR at 10  µg/ml for 24 h (P < 0.05). Moreover, the MC-LR-treated cells exhibited condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei, features of apoptosis, as judged by Hoechst 33258 staining. We also analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of three apoptosis-related genes, p53, bax and bcl-2, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses, respectively. Both p53 and bax function as promoters of apoptosis, while bcl-2 is an apoptotic suppressor. The mRNA and protein expression levels of p53 and bax were increased in Sertoli cells treated with MC-LR at 10  µg/ml compared with the control group (P < 0.05), while the bcl-2 protein levels were decreased in cells treated with MC-LR at 10  µg/ml (P < 0.05). Moreover, caspase-3 activity that is involved in the induction of apoptosis was significantly increased in Sertoli cells treated with MC-LR. These results indicate that MC-LR induces apoptosis of Sertoli cells.

8074466|t|Recombinant human interferon alpha-2a increases 5-fluorouracil efficacy by elevating fluorouridine concentration in tumor tissue.
8074466|a|The modulating effect of recombinant human interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) on the antitumor efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against human carcinoma cell lines was investigated in vitro and in vivo. 5-FU, fluorouridine (FUR) or fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) were tested against cultured human colon tumor C-1 cells with or without IFN-alpha. The in vitro antitumor activity of 5-FU was enhanced by the addition of IFN-alpha, but IFN-alpha did not increase the effect of FUR or FUdR. The in vivo antitumor activity of 5-FU with or without IFN-alpha was assessed using Co-4, a human colon carcinoma xenograft, in nude mice. Thymidylate synthetase inhibition and concentration of FUR in the treated tumor tissues were concomitantly measured. A synergistic effect of 5-FU and IFN-alpha was observed on Co-4 in nude mice, and this in vivo synergism was obtained without any increment of thymidylate synthetase inhibition or side effects in terms of death rate and body weight loss. The intratumoral concentration of FUR was significantly increased by the addition of IFN-alpha in Co-4 tumor tissue treated with 5-FU. These results suggest that the mechanism of the combined effect of 5-FU and IFN-alpha is not related to enhancement of thymidylate synthetase inhibition, but to an increase of FUR concentration in the target tumor tissue. It is expected that this combination method will be clinically useful for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma.

16830204|t|Osteoprotegerin and bone mass in squamous cell head and neck cancer patients.
16830204|a|Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is considered one of the main regulators of bone remodeling. Various patterns of serum OPG levels have been described in different types of tumors. We undertook this study to determine serum OPG levels in patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC), analyzing their relationship with other metabolic bone parameters and bone mineral density (BMD), as well as the possible influence of chemotherapy. Forty male patients with localized SCHNC were studied, and their results were compared with those of 40 healthy male controls. The type of treatment followed by each patient was noted. Age, weight, height, and lifestyle habits were recorded; and OPG, Ca(2+), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and serum C-terminal cross-links telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were determined. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip was also measured. Serum OPG was higher in patients than in controls (91.7 +/- 25.8 vs. 77.2 +/- 26.3, P = 0.02). ICTP (a bone resorption marker) was 37% higher in patients (P = 0.007). Bone mass was lower in patients at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. Lumbar spine Z-score showed a significant progressive decrease in controls, stage I-III patients, and stage IV patients. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between the disease and serum OPG levels, the odds ratio per standard deviation increase of this being 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.1-3.8, P = 0.04) after adjusting for bone mass and ICTP serum levels, as well as for alcohol and smoking history. Adjustment for alcohol intake and tobacco use did not cancel out BMD differences between patients and controls. Patients with SCHNC show increased OPG serum levels, increased bone resorption, and decreased bone mass. The OPG rise appears to be unrelated to the BMD decrease, and the BMD decrease seems to be, at least in part, independent of smoking and drinking habits. No differences in either OPG or BMD were seen between patients with and without chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms responsible for OPG and BMD changes in SCHNC.

23649958|t|Effect of transdermal isopropyl alcohol on the international normalized ratio in five warfarin-treated patients.
23649958|a|Warfarin, an anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic window, is largely metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9. Isopropyl alcohol has been shown to inhibit the activity of this enzyme. Use of topical isopropyl alcohol as a rubefacient may place patients at risk for systemic exposure. Isopropyl alcohol's effect on the international normalized ratio (INR) has not been well characterized. We describe five patients who experienced INR elevations after topical application of isopropyl alcohol. Each patient's INR was therapeutic for at least seven visits prior to becoming supratherapeutic. All patients confirmed drug adherence and denied medication or dietary changes. Seventy percent isopropyl alcohol was used in all cases over a large body surface area of intact skin multiple times daily for several days. All patients experienced a 10% or greater increase in their INR compared to previous levels. On discontinuation of isopropyl alcohol, each patient's INR returned to and remained in therapeutic range for the next 2 months. Prediction of isopropyl alcohol's effect of the INR is confound by several factors, notably the BSA covered, concentration of alcohol in the product, contact time with the skin, and skin integrity. It is important that clinicians inquire about the use of isopropyl alcohol and educate patients about its potential risk in those receiving warfarin therapy.

24441951|a|A new dye for vitreoretinal surgery comprised of soluble lutein/zeaxanthin 1 % and brilliant blue 0.025 % is advantageous compared with other dyes currently used for chromovitrectomy, and showed no signs of toxicity at 1 month of follow-up. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a dye [soluble lutein/zeaxanthin (LZ) 1 % and brilliant blue (BB) 0.025 %] for improving removal of vitreous, epiretinal membranes (ERM), and internal limiting membranes (ILM) in humans. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 18 eyes treated surgically for a macular hole or ERM. Eighteen surgeons performed chromovitrectomy using the dye, and completed a questionnaire to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dye. . Examinations included best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements and optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and autofluorescence performed at baseline and days 1, 7, and 30 postoperatively. RESULTS: The green dye was deposited on the posterior pole; vigorous dye flushing into the vitreous cavity was unnecessary. All surgeons reported that the ILM stained greenish-blue; 94.4 % reported ILM peeling adequate; the ERM stained poorly. No evidence of toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: The new dye deposited on the posterior pole due to its higher density. The ability to stain the ILM was similar to BB. The new dye has ability to stain the vitreous, hyaloid, and especially the ILM satisfactorily. The new dye may be useful during chromovitrectomy.

8935813|t|A randomized, controlled, dose-ranging trial of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia.
8935813|a|Sertindole is a novel antipsychotic agent with high selectivity for the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway and nanomolar affinities for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and norepinephrine NE alpha 1 receptors. This 40-day randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging multicenter study was designed to assess the effect of sertindole on previously neuroleptic-responsive, hospitalized schizophrenic patients (n = 205). Sertindole doses began at 4 mg/day and were increased to 8, 12, or 20 mg/day, depending on randomization. Efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed by movement rating scales, EPS-related adverse events, and use of anti-EPS medications. A dose-related improvement was observed for PANSS, BPRS, and CGI, with statistically significant mean differences (P < 0.05) between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole (decreases from baseline of -5.8 versus -16.9 for PANSS, -4.8 versus -10.4 for BPRS, respectively). The differences in CGI final improvement score between placebo and 20-mg/day sertindole were 3.8 versus 2.9, respectively. EPS-related events were comparable in the placebo and sertindole groups. In conclusion, sertindole 20 mg/day was effective, well tolerated, and not associated with significant motor system abnormalities.

22372305|t|Cellular responses to cobalt-chrome and CP titanium--an in vitro comparison of frameworks for implant-retained oral prostheses.
22372305|a|The responses of cell types in peri-implant tissues to cobalt-chrome and titanium were studied in vitro. Cylinders were made from both a cobalt-chrome alloy and commercially pure titanium (length 6 mm, diameter 7.9 mm). Plastic tubes were placed over the cylinders to create cell culture wells, in which human epithelial cells or mouse fibroblasts were cultivated. Cell viability was studied using the Alamar Blue method. The surface structure of two samples of each material was analyzed with optical interferometry. The morphology of cells grown on cylinders of each material was studied with scanning electronic microscopy. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts in the titanium group were more viable than those in the cobalt-chrome group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). The titanium surfaces had a greater height deviation (S(a), p = 0.027) but were less dense (S(ds), p = 0.044) than the cobalt-chrome group. The scanning electronic microscopy revealed no major deviations from normal cell morphology. Within the limitations of the present study, the findings indicate that epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts have a stronger negative response to cobalt-chrome alloy than to titanium. We suggest that these differences can be explained only bythe material per se and not by the minor differences in surface structure. Further and clinical studies are needed to confirm the significance of these findings.

20568301|t|Biliary apotopes and anti-mitochondrial antibodies activate innate immune responses in primary biliary cirrhosis.
20568301|a|Our understanding of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been significantly enhanced by the rigorous dissection of the multilineage T and B cell response against the immunodominant mitochondrial autoantigen, the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). PDC-E2 is a ubiquitous protein present in mitochondria of nucleated cells. However, the damage of PBC is confined to small biliary epithelial cells (BECs). We have previously demonstrated that BECs translocate immunologically intact PDC-E2 to apoptotic bodies and create an apotope. To define the significance of this observation, we have studied the ability of biliary or control epithelial apotopes to induce cytokine secretion from mature monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMphis) from either patients with PBC or controls in the presence or absence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs). We demonstrate that there is intense inflammatory cytokine production in the presence of the unique triad of BEC apotopes, macrophages from patients with PBC, and AMAs. The cytokine secretion is inhibited by anti-CD16 and is not due to differences in apotope uptake. Moreover, MDMphis from PBC patients cultured with BEC apoptotic bodies in the presence of AMAs markedly increase tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand expression. CONCLUSION: These results provide a mechanism for the biliary specificity of PBC, the recurrence of disease after liver transplantation, and the success of ursodiol in treatment. They further emphasize the critical role of the innate immune system in the perpetuation of this autoimmune disease.

8787689|t|The protective role of manganese superoxide dismutase against adriamycin-induced acute cardiac toxicity in transgenic mice.
8787689|a|Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug known to cause severe cardiac toxicity. Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of free radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity and the intracellular target for ADR-induced cardiac toxicity are still not well understood. We produced three transgenic mice lines expressing increased levels of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial enzyme, as an animal model to investigate the role of ADR-mediated free radical generation in mitochondria. The human MnSOD was expressed, functionally active, and properly transported into mitochondria in the heart of transgenic mice. The levels of copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not change in the transgenic mice. Electron microscopy revealed dose-dependent ultrastructural alterations with marked mitochondrial damage in nontransgenic mice treated with ADR, but not in the transgenic littermates. Biochemical analysis indicated that the levels of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in ADR-treated mice were significantly greater in nontransgenic than their transgenic littermates expressing a high level of human MnSOD after ADR treatment. These results support a major role for free radical generation in ADR toxicity as well as suggesting mitochondria as the critical site of cardiac injury.

9458024|t|Breast-feeding during treatment with cyclosporine.
9458024|a|BACKGROUND: Mothers treated with cyclosporine (CsA) have previously not been allowed to breast-feed due to the reported accumulation of the drug in breast milk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the consequences of allowing breast-feeding. METHODS: Seven infants were breast-fed by mothers who had undergone kidney transplantation alone (n=5) or simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplants (n=2). In addition to CsA, all mothers received prednisolone at 5-7.5 mg/day and six mothers received azathioprine at 50-100 mg. CsA concentration was measured in the whole blood of mothers and babies and in breast milk. Serum creatinine was measured in babies 1 week after birth and after 4-12 months of breast-feeding. RESULTS: Blood CsA levels ranged from 55 to 130 ng/ml in mothers (12-hr trough), 50 to 227 ng/ml in breast milk (mean for each woman), and was below the detection limit of 30 ng/ml in all infants. Breast milk concentration ranged from 87 to 440 ng/ml in 16 samples obtained at various time points from one mother. Infants' serum creatinine ranged from 25 to 54 micromol/L at 1 week after birth and 23-52 micromol/L after breast-feeding. All babies thrived. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-fed infants of mothers treated with CsA received less than 300 microg per day of CsA and absorbed undetectable amounts. There were no demonstrable nephrotoxic effects or other side effects. Thus, women with kidney transplants could be allowed to breast-feed.

23444014|t|Sensory nerve terminal mitochondrial dysfunction activates airway sensory nerves via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels.
23444014|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent oxidative stress has been reported for a variety of cell types in inflammatory diseases. Given the abundance of mitochondria at the peripheral terminals of sensory nerves and the sensitivity of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (V1) to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their downstream products of lipid peroxidation, we investigated the effect of nerve terminal mitochondrial dysfunction on airway sensory nerve excitability. Here we show that mitochondrial dysfunction evoked by acute treatment with antimycin A (mitochondrial complex III Qi site inhibitor) preferentially activated TRPA1-expressing "nociceptor-like" mouse bronchopulmonary C-fibers. Action potential discharge was reduced by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. Inhibition of TRPV1 further reduced C-fiber activation. In mouse dissociated vagal neurons, antimycin A induced Ca(2+) influx that was significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout of either TRPA1 or TRPV1. Inhibition of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 was required to abolish antimycin A-induced Ca(2+) influx in vagal neurons. Using an HEK293 cell expression system, antimycin A induced concentration-dependent activation of both hTRPA1 and hTRPV1 but failed to activate nontransfected cells. Myxothiazol (complex III Qo site inhibitor) inhibited antimycin A-induced TRPA1 activation, as did the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Scavenging of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide inhibited TRPA1 activation following mitochondrial modulation. In conclusion, we present evidence that acute mitochondrial dysfunction activates airway sensory nerves preferentially via TRPA1 through the actions of mitochondrially-derived ROS. This represents a novel mechanism by which inflammation may be transduced into nociceptive electrical signaling.

20353739|t|Brucellosis in dialysis patients. Does it exist?
20353739|a|BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease transmittable to humans. It is diagnosed either by isolation of Brucella organism in culture of blood or other sample types (e.g., bone marrow or liver biopsy specimens), or by a combination of serological tests and clinical findings. Dialysis patients constitute a special population group with an impaired autoimmune system and a propensity to develop infections, such as brucellosis. This paper presents the high incidence of brucellosis in our dialysis patients during last year, while there was not any zoonotic infection recorded in the previous at least 5 year period. METHODS-RESULTS: This is a retrospective study including 8 dialysis patients, undergoing renal replacement therapies (5 patients were on hemodialysis (HD) and 3 on peritoneal dialysis (PD)), who out of a total of 124 patients developed brucellosis, during the last year. Four patients were male and four female and their mean age was 67 +/- 9 years. Clinical presentation of Brucellosis infection was mild with low-grade fever and symptoms of influenza. All patients were living in places where animal brucellosis was prevalent. Infection was diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and signs and with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of peripheral blood. The affected patients had consumed fresh unpasteurized milk and cheese and were treated with oral doxycycline and oral rifampicin for 6 weeks. All patients are in follow up for at least 1 year, during which there were no relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can occur in dialysis patients who are susceptible to infection under certain conditions. Our brucellosis patients lived in agricultural and veterinary areas and had consumed unpasteurized milk and cheese and insufficiently cooked meat derived from infected animals.

1593359|t|Addition of metolazone to overcome tolerance to furosemide in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
1593359|a|A decreased response to the loop diuretic furosemide develops within a few doses in young infants. We tested the hypothesis that the use of the thiazide-like diuretic metolazone, in combination with furosemide, would inhibit water and electrolyte reabsorption and overcome pharmacologic tolerance to furosemide alone. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia of similar gestational and postnatal ages were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received furosemide (1 mg/kg per dose) intravenously every 24 hours for a total of five doses. Group 2 (n = 8) received the same treatment as group 1, but in addition metolazone (0.2 mg/kg per dose) was given enterally with doses 3 and 4 of furosemide. Group 3 (n = 8) received metolazone (0.2 mg/kg per dose) enterally every 24 hours for five doses. Urine was collected before the first diuretic dose and throughout the study for determination of the urine flow rate; urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium; and creatinine clearance. Urinary flow rate and urinary sodium and chloride excretion increased after the first dose in all groups. In the infants treated with either furosemide or metolazone, urinary flow rate and urinary and chloride excretion returned to baseline values after the last three doses. In contrast, when furosemide was administered with metolazone, urinary flow rate and urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium were greater than the values for baseline and for the previous dose, as well as for the corresponding doses of furosemide in group 1 and metolazone in group 3. Tolerance to furosemide (group 1) and metolazone (group 3) appeared to be explained by compensatory increased sodium and chloride reabsorption without changes in creatinine clearance. We conclude that the administration of metolazone with furosemide enhances diuresis, natriuresis, and chloruresis and overcomes the rapid development of tolerance to furosemide in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia by blocking the compensatory increase in renal sodium and chloride absorption.

11556039|t|Assessment of response to tamoxifen among Iraqi patients with advanced breast cancer.
11556039|a|Eighty-eight women presenting with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone. Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) were immunocytochemically analysed in mammary tumour cells obtained by fine needle sampling from 73 patients. Of the breast carcinomas, 34.2% were ER+/PR+ and 43.8% were ER-/PR-. The ER+ content increased with age in postmenopausal women. After tamoxifen treatment objective remission occurred in 39.7% of the women. The overall response rate was 53.3% in the ER+/PR- group and 73.1% in the ER+/PR+ group. However, the response elicited in a case of the ER-/PR- phenotype justified the randomized use of tamoxifen among patients in Iraq where the necessary requirements for hormone receptor assessment are almost unavailable.

19839485|t|Antibiotic resistance of periodontal pathogens obtained from frequent antibiotic users.
19839485|a|The occurrence of bacterial strains resistant to different antimicrobials is a growing problem in Latin American countries. The aim was to measure the antimicrobial susceptibility of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Prophyromona gingivalis, isolated from chronic periodontitis patients. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with generalized- moderate or advanced- chronic periodontitis were consecutively recruited from patients attending the Periodontal Specialist Program, Javeriana University, according to specific criteria, including no recent antibiotic consumption. All patients filled out a questionnaire on antibiotic intake. The deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant was sampled. Pooled samples were mixed, diluted and plated on enriched brucella agar plates. After anaerobic incubation, identification of the target bacteria was performed, based on colony morphology, gram staining, aerotolerance and biochemical reactions (RapID Ana II, Remel, U.S.A.). Following identification, the bacteria were subjected to antimicrobial testing, using amoxicillin, tetracycline, doxycicline, azithromycin and metronidazole (E-test, AbBiodisk, Sweden). The minimal inhibitory concentrations obtained were compared with a reference standard to determine antimicrobial resistance. Amoxicillin-resistant species were tested for beta-lactamase production. Forty-four percent of the patients used antibiotics without any medical prescription, 40% used antibiotics at least once a year. The presence of eleven species was confirmed after a series of biochemical tests: four Fusobacterium nucleatum, five Prevotella intermedia and two Prophyromona gingivalis. All strains were resistant to metronidazole, five were resistant to tetracycline and azithromicin, and two strains were resistant to doxycicline and amoxicillin. The strains resistant to amoxicillin were positive for beta-lactamase production, Antimicrobial resistance, particularly against metronidazole, was a common phenomenon for the bacterial isolates analyzed in this Colombian sample.

23054260|t|The wages of sin: how the discovery of penicillin reshaped modern sexuality.
23054260|a|It was not until 1943, amid world war, that penicillin was found to be an effective treatment for syphilis. This study investigated the hypothesis that a decrease in the cost of syphilis due to penicillin spurred an increase in risky non-traditional sex. Using nationally comprehensive vital statistics, this study found evidence that the era of modern sexuality originated in the mid to late 1950s. Measures of risky non-traditional sexual behavior began to rise during this period. These trends appeared to coincide with the collapse of the syphilis epidemic. Syphilis incidence reached an all-time low in 1957 and syphilis deaths fell rapidly during the 1940s and early 1950s. Regression analysis demonstrated that most measures of sexual behavior significantly increased immediately following the collapse of syphilis and most measures were significantly associated with the syphilis death rate. Together, the findings supported the notion that the discovery of penicillin decreased the cost of syphilis and thereby played an important role in shaping modern sexuality.

22659338|t|A ZnO-doped adhesive reduced collagen degradation favouring dentine remineralization.
22659338|a|OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of a ZnO-doped etch and rinse adhesive in decreasing MMPs-mediated collagen degradation at the resin-dentine hybrid layer, and increasing bonding stability. METHODS: C-terminal telopeptide concentrations (ICTP) were determined after 24h, 1wk and 4wk in human dentine beams. Dentine was treated: (1) 37% phosphoric acid for 15s (PA), (2) PA-etched dentine infiltrated with Single Bond (SB), (3) PA-etched dentine infiltrated with ZnO doped SB (ZnO particles--10wt%--were added to the bonding resin) (ZnO-SB), and (4) Clearfil SE Bond primed-dentine was infiltrated with Clearfil SE bonding resin (CSE). Microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was assessed for the different groups at 24h and after 3months. Debonded dentine surfaces were studied by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: MMPs-mediated collagen degradation occurred in demineralized dentine (PA). Resin infiltration decreased collagen degradation. The lowest collagen degradation was found for Zn-doped SB, followed by CSE. When these adhesives were applied, ICTP values did not change throughout the study period. At 24h, similar MTBS was attained for all adhesives. Only SB decreased MTBS after three months. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of ZnO particles to SB produced a reduction in dentine collagen degradation and increased resin-dentine bonds durability. In Zn-doped adhesive interfaces, a calcium phosphate layer and tubular occlusion was encountered at the debonded interface. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ZnO particles addition into the bonding resin of SB makes a breakthrough to prevent the hybrid layer degradation and to preserve its bonding efficacy overtime.

2044581|t|Severe hypoaldosteronism due to corticosterone methyl oxidase type II deficiency in two boys: metabolic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry studies.
2044581|a|Infection-triggered, life-threatening salt-loss and hyperkalaemia developed in two male infants with wasting, inappropriately low plasma aldosterone concentrations and elevated plasma renin activity. The presumptive diagnosis of a defective terminal step in aldosterone biosynthesis was made by the presence of large amounts of 11-dehydrotetrahydrocorticosterone and its 18-hydroxylated metabolite (18-OH-THA), free 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B) and 18-hydroxytetrahydrocorticosterone in the urine of both patients. The diagnosis of corticosterone methyl oxidase type II (CMO II) deficiency was confirmed by an elevated urinary 18-OH-THA to tetrahydroaldosterone ratio in one boy and by an elevated plasma 18-OH-B to aldosterone ratio in the other boy. Unknown steroids responsible for the salt-loss were not identified. Sodium supplementation but not short-term high dose oral 9 alpha-fluorcortisol (FF) normalized the hyponatraemia in one patient, in whom sodium (Na+)/potassium (K+) co-transport was decreased. Both patients eventually received long-term FF treatment to prevent impairment of longitudinal growth caused by chronic salt-loss. The diagnosis of CMO II deficiency should always be confirmed by elevated precursor-product ratios in urine or plasma, using radioimmunoassays with prior chromatographic separation. Metabolic studies as the short-term response of serum Na+ to high dose FF may not be helpful in differentiating aldosterone biosynthetic defects from end-organ resistance to mineralocorticoids.

2056948|t|Extracorporeal techniques in the treatment of poisoned patients.
2056948|a|The role of haemodialysis, haemoperfusion and haemofiltration in the management of poisoned patients is reviewed in light of 15 years' clinical experience. During haemodialysis, blood is pumped across a semipermeable membrane (dialysis) through which the compound diffuses and, during haemoperfusion, through a cartridge that contains activated charcoal to which the compound is adsorbed. During haemofiltration, the constituents of blood that have a relative molecular mass which is below the cut-off point of the hollow fibre membrane (usually less than 40,000) are extracted. Haemofiltration is indicated particularly for aminoglycoside toxicity. The clearance by these three procedures depends on the physicochemical characteristics and kinetics of the toxic compound. In general, if a compound is adsorbed by charcoal, the clearance by haemoperfusion will be higher than that achieved by haemodialysis. Similarly, if a compound is amenable to removal by haemodialysis, its clearance will be greater than that achieved by haemofiltration. The indications for extracorporeal elimination depend on the clinical severity and complications of the overdose, the characteristics of the individual patient and the nature, dose and plasma concentrations of the toxic substance. It is generally accepted that extracorporeal elimination is worthwhile if it increases total body clearance by 30% or more. It has little or no value for intoxication caused by chloroquine, flecainide, methotrexate, paraquat, quinine, and tricyclic antidepressants. The complications of extracorporeal elimination which are encountered most frequently are: hypotension; blood loss; haematomas; metabolic disequilibria; mechanical problems such as air embolism; and, in the case of haemoperfusion, hypocalcaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. In practice, the compounds for which extracorporeal elimination is used most frequently are the alcohols, lithium and salicylate (haemodialysis) and theophylline (haemofiltration).

21224840|t|Outcome following thiopurine use in children with ulcerative colitis: a prospective multicenter registry study.
21224840|a|OBJECTIVES: Despite little supporting data, thiopurine use is common in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Our aim was to determine outcome following thiopurine use in a multicenter inception cohort of children diagnosed with UC. METHODS: Data were obtained from a prospective observational study of newly diagnosed children <16 years of age. Data are recorded at diagnosis, 30 days, and quarterly. Patients are managed by physician dictates not protocol. Disease activity is classified by physician global assessment. The primary outcome was corticosteroid (CS)-free inactive UC at 1 year following thiopurine initiation without the need for rescue therapy (infliximab, calcineurin inhibitors, or colectomy). RESULTS: Of 1,490 patients in our registry, 394 have UC (mean age at diagnosis 11.3 ±3.7 years); 197 (50%) received thiopurine (49%  <=3 months from diagnosis). Also, 84% were receiving CSs and 60% 5-aminosalicylates at thiopurine start. Of the 197 patients, there was insufficient follow-up (41), previous or concomitant use of infliximab (16), or calcineurin inhibitor (7), leaving 133 patients evaluable at 1 year. Of these, 65 (49%) had CS-free inactive UC without rescue therapy. CS-free inactive disease at 1 year after initiating thiopurine was not affected by starting thiopurine  <=3 months vs. >3 months from diagnosis, gender, age, or concomitant treatment with 5-aminosalicylates. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the likelihood of remaining free of rescue therapy in the thiopurine-treated patients was 73% at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of children with UC starting thiopurine without previous or concomitant biologic or calcineurin inhibitor therapy have CS-free inactive disease 1 year later without the need for rescue therapy.

17825886|t|Resveratrol inhibits glucose metabolism in human ovarian cancer cells.
17825886|a|OBJECTIVES: Resveratrol is a phytoalexin found in grapes that inhibits the in vitro growth of multiple tumor cell types. We showed previously that resveratrol induces autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer cells. Because autophagy is typically an adaptive response to nutrient starvation, we hypothesized that autophagy would also be triggered when ovarian cancer cells are nutrient deprived and that resveratrol could in fact be acting by inducing a starvation-like signaling response. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cells were incubated with normal media, media containing resveratrol, glucose free media, or media lacking amino acids. Growth inhibition was determined using the sulforhodamine assay. Cells were evaluated for autophagocytosis by analyzing cleavage of LC3. Glucose uptake, lactate production, and activation of glycolytic regulators pAkt and pmTOR were analyzed following resveratrol treatment. RESULTS: We show here that epithelial ovarian cancer cells are highly sensitive to glucose-deprivation-induced cell death and like resveratrol, glucose deprivation induces caspase-independent cell death with hallmarks of autophagy. Consistent with the hypothesis that resveratrol treatment results in biochemical conditions that mirror a nutrient deprived state, we found that resveratrol dramatically reduces glucose uptake and lactate production. Moreover, resveratrol reduces the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR, two signals that increase glucose uptake and the rate limiting steps in glycolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that resveratrol-induced changes in glucose utilization comprise the mechanism that underlies resveratrol-induced autophagocytosis in ovarian cancer. Inhibition of glycolysis in ovarian cancer with resveratrol or other compounds may be effective therapy for ovarian cancer.

12460716|t|Iontophoretic delivery of apomorphine: from in-vitro modelling to the Parkinson patient.
12460716|a|Apomorphine is a mixed dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist which is potentially useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The delivery of apomorphine is however complicated because it is not absorbed orally and other delivery routes with the exception of the intravenous route seem to fail. The most interesting route for controlled delivery of apomorphine is transdermal iontophoresis because this could enable the Parkinson patient to directly control the needed amount of apomorphine by increasing or decreasing the drug input in order to achieve optimal drug therapy ('on-demand') with a minimum of toxic side effects. The typical features of Parkinson's disease could be used to monitor the needed drug input and even more elegantly by means of suitable chip sensors which are able to directly measure bradykinesia, akinesia and/or tremor and to regulate in such a way the drug input. Such a chip-controlled iontophoretic system would be the first closed-loop system monitoring not pharmacokinetic data (blood levels) but more importantly externally measurable pharmacodynamic effects of Parkinson's disease. This scenario is more feasible as skin irritation and toxicity studies have proven that iontophoresis is a safe route of treatment. This review describes the basics of iontophoresis and the development of a transdermal iontophoretic delivery system on the basis of integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) investigations in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Transdermal iontophoretic transport of apomorphine was studied both in vitro with human stratum corneum using a newly developed iontophoretic continuous flow-through transport cell and in vivo in a first exploratory study in patients with Parkinson's disease. These studies showed that the delivery of apomorphine is feasible and furthermore the rate of delivery can be controlled by variation of the current densities. Additionally the pretreatment of the skin either with a mono-surfactant or a vesicular suspension of elastic liquid-state vesicles may be useful to further increase the apomorphine flux across the skin in combination with iontophoresis.

16536764|t|Alfuzosin 10 mg once daily prevents overall clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia but not acute urinary retention: results of a 2-year placebo-controlled study.
16536764|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of alfuzosin 10 mg once daily administered for 2 years on progression events in men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 1522 men at risk of having progression events from LUTS/BPH were randomized to receive alfuzosin 10 mg once daily (759) or placebo (763) for 2 years. Endpoints assessed were the occurrence of a first episode of acute urinary retention (AUR; primary) and the need for BPH-related surgery. Post hoc analyses included a deterioration in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of > or = 4 points and overall clinical progression of BPH (occurrence of AUR and/or surgery and/or symptom deterioration). RESULTS: Over 2 years, symptom deterioration was the most common progression event (14.3%), followed by BPH-related surgery (5.8%) and AUR (2.0%). Alfuzosin did not reduce the risk of AUR (alfuzosin 2.1% vs placebo 1.8%, P = 0.82) but tended to reduce the risk of surgery (5.1% vs 6.5%, P = 0.18); the reduction in risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval with alfuzosin was 22 (-18 to 48)%; and significantly reduced the risk of symptom deterioration (11.7% vs 16.8%; P = 0.0013); the RR was 30 (10-46)%. The overall clinical progression of BPH was significantly lower with alfuzosin than with placebo (16.3% vs 22.1%, P < 0.001); RR 26 (9-40)%. Alfuzosin also significantly improved the IPSS (P = 0.017), quality of life (P < 0.001) and peak flow rate (P = 0.001) compared with placebo. Baseline levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predicted both AUR and BPH-related surgery events, while the baseline postvoid residual urine volume predicted symptom deterioration. The incidence of adverse events with alfuzosin was comparable to that with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Alfuzosin 10 mg once daily prevents the overall clinical progression of BPH, defined by the occurrence of a deterioration in IPSS of > or = 4 points and/or AUR and/or BPH-related surgery, but does not reduce the primary occurrence of AUR. Alfuzosin significantly improves LUTS and quality of life over 2 years, and is well tolerated.

22441720|t|Anemia due to coadministration of renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors and PPARy agonists in uncomplicated diabetic patients.
22441720|a|Therapy with either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) or thiazolidinediones (TZD) is associated with dose-dependent decrements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. We aimed to investigate the impact of the coadministration of TZD and ACEI/ARB on hematocrit and hemoglobin values in uncomplicated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal serum creatinine.Data from patients with type 2 diabetes currently followed, were reviewed and patients treated with ACEI/ARB and/or TZD were identified. For the purpose of this study the following 4 groups of 30 stable non-anemic diabetic patients each matched for age, gender, and BMI were formed. Group ACEI/ARB included patients on ACEI/ARB without TZD, group TZD included patients on TZD and antihypertensive agents other than ACEI/ARB, group ACEI/ARB/TZD consisted of patients on combined therapy with ACEI/ARB and TZD and the control group C included patients never exposed to ACEI/ARB or TZD. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prior to initiation of treatment and after 6 months.Neither hematocrit nor hemoglobin showed any significant change from baseline at the end of the study in group C. In both group ACEI/ARB and group TZD a small, but statistically significant reduction in hematocrit (~ 1% point) and hemoglobin levels (~ 0.3 g/dl) was seen. A greater statistically and clinically important reduction in hematocrit (~ 3% points) and hemoglobin (~ 1 g/dl) levels was observed in group ACEI/ARB/TZD. Furthermore, incident anemia at the end reached 7% in group TZD and 23% in group ACEI/ARB/TZD.Coadministration of RAS inhibitors and PPAR-y agonists should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematocrit lowering and anemia in uncomplicated type 2 diabetic patients with normal serum creatinine. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism(s), the cardiovascular consequences and the cost utility of anemia workup in such patients.

11053776|t|Oxidized low-density lipoprotein induces calcium influx in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
11053776|a|Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been suggested to play a role in atherosclerosis, but intracellular signaling after stimulation with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is unknown. We investigated mechanistic aspects of oxidized LDL-induced superoxide production by human PMN, with special emphasis on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Oxidized LDL, but not native LDL, evoked an early but sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a delayed production of superoxide. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) could be reduced by fucoidan and completely prevented by U73122, suggesting involvement of the scavenger receptor and coupling to the phospholipase C signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) partly results from protein kinase C-dependent Ca(2+) influx. The relevance of this Ca(2+) entry for oxidized LDL-stimulated effects is illustrated by the finding that superoxide production was markedly reduced in the absence of external Ca(2+). Finally, inhibition of phagocytosis by cytochalasin B abolished oxidized LDL-stimulated superoxide production without affecting, however, the Ca(2+) mobilization. These effects of oxidized LDL on [Ca(2+)](i) and on respiratory burst of PMN may underlie the occurrence of elevated levels of [Ca(2+)](i) of resting PMN in hypercholesterolemia and represent a mechanism by which PMN can amplify processes in the early phase of atherosclerosis.

22344919|t|Cucurbitane triterpenoids from the leaves of Momordica charantia, and their cancer chemopreventive effects and cytotoxicities.
22344919|a|Seventeen cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, 1-17, including six new compounds, (23E)-3b,25-dihydroxy-7b-methoxycucurbita-5,23-dien-19-al (1), (23S*)-3b-hydroxy-7b,23-dimethoxycucurbita-5,24-dien-19-al (6), (23R*)-23-O-methylmomordicine IV (7), (25Î¾)-26-hydroxymomordicoside L (8), 25-oxo-27-normomordicoside L (9), and 25-O-methylkaravilagenin D (12), were isolated from a MeOH extract of the leaves of Japanese Momordica charantia. The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses and comparison with literature. Compounds 1-17 were examined for their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, a known primary screening test for inhibitors of tumor promotion. Four compounds, 1, (23E)-3b,7b-dihydroxy-25-methoxycucurbita-5,23-dien-19-al (2), karavilagenin D (11), and 12, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction with IC(50) values in the range of 242-264 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA. In addition, compounds 1 and 11 exhibited inhibitory effects on skin-tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis test based on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator, and with TPA as a promoter. Furthermore, upon evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of compounds 1-17 against human cancer cell lines, compounds 2, 5-7, 9, and 14 showed potent activities against HL60 cell line, and compound 2 against SK-BR-3 cell line.

19885908|t|Prevalence of hepatitis B and C and risk factors for nonvaccination in inflammatory bowel disease patients in Northeast France.
19885908|a|BACKGROUND: Data regarding the prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) and hepatitis B (HBV) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are conflicting. METHODS: In all, 315 IBD (252 Crohn's disease [CD] and 63 ulcerative colitis [UC]) patients were consecutively recruited between June 2005 and May 2009. RESULTS: The median age was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 24-43) and median disease duration was 5 years (IQR: 2-11). Present and/or past HBV and HCV infection was found in 2.86% of 315 patients (CD: HBsAg 0.79%, anti-HBc 2.78%, anti-HCV 0.79%; UC: HBsAg 1.59%, anti-HBc 1.59%, anti-HCV 1.59%). Effective vaccination (anti-HBs without anti-HBc) was present in 48.9% of 315 patients. In multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis over 31 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.58; P = 0.005), disease duration over 7 years (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.83; P = 0.005), age at inclusion over 33 years (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.20-0.94; P = 0.005), and CD (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.15-0.58; P = 0.005) were associated with the lack of effective vaccination. Two HBsAg-positive patients, including 1 under curative nucleoside/nucleotide analog treatment, had received 6 and 7 infliximab infusions, and 1 HCV RNA-positive subject had been receiving corticosteroid and azathioprine therapies for 12 and 33 months, respectively. No viral reactivation occurred in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in French IBD patients is similar to that of the general population. While the ECCO recommends an effective HBV vaccination in IBD, half of the patients were not vaccinated. The nonvaccination risk factors identified in our study may allow targeted vaccination coverage.

18406100|t|Axillary recurrence after a tumour-negative sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.
18406100|a|BACKGROUND: Sentinel node biopsy became the standard of care before consensus on the technique was reached and without randomized studies having shown a similar or decreased axillary recurrence rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate studies reporting on patients with a negative sentinel node biopsy. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature for studies concerning clinically node-negative breast cancer patients with a tumour-negative sentinel node biopsy and no subsequent axillary node dissection. The axillary recurrence rate was determined, as well as the sensitivity of the sentinel node procedure and the differences in lymphatic mapping techniques. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies concerning 14 959 sentinel node-negative breast cancer patients followed for a median of 34 months were selected. Sixty-seven patients developed an axillary recurrence, resulting in a recurrence rate of 0.3%. The sensitivity of the sentinel node biopsy was 100%. Uni- and multivariable variable analyses showed that the lowest recurrence rates were reported in studies performed in cancer centres, in studies that described the use of (99m)Tc-sulphur colloid, and also when investigators used the superficial injection technique or evaluated the harvested sentinel nodes with haematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic literature review, the axillary recurrence rate in sentinel node-negative patients is 0.3%, which is well within the desired range. The median sensitivity of the procedure appears to be as high as 100%. The recurrence rate is influenced by the differences in the lymphatic mapping technique.

8366286|t|Sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin in males with chronic viral hepatitis during recombinant interferon-alpha 2b therapy.
8366286|a|The effect of long-term treatment with recombinant interferon-alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2b) on luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was evaluated in 7 male patients suffering from chronic viral hepatitis. The drug was given three times a week for 6 months in a single standard dose of 3 x 10(6) units. Hormone evaluations were performed in basal conditions and every 2 months for 12 months. Serum testosterone values decreased after IFN treatment, reaching the lowest levels at the 6th month. However, testosterone values did not fall below the normal range. Serum SHBG concentrations, which were above the normal range in basal conditions, also decreased after IFN. Serum-free testosterone and LH concentrations did not change during IFN therapy. IFN-alpha 2b at the dose and schedule employed was not responsible for any measurable imbalance in male sex hormones.

23877691|t|Characterization of Hepatitis C virus resistance from a multiple-dose clinical trial of the novel NS5A inhibitor GS-5885.
23877691|a|GS-5885 is a novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor. In a 3-day monotherapy study in treatment-naive genotype 1a (GT1a) and GT1b HCV-infected subjects, median viral load reductions ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 log10 HCV RNA IU/ml across dosing cohorts (1, 3, 10, 30, or 90 mg once daily). Here, we report viral sequencing and phenotypic analysis of clinical isolates from this study. Detection of baseline NS5A amino acid substitutions at positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 in GT1a was associated with a reduced treatment response. In the GT1b cohort, Y93H was detected in 100% of subjects at day 4 or 14. In the Gt1a cohort, population sequencing detected NS5A resistance-associated mutations at day 4 or 14 for 3/10 subjects at the 1-mg dose and for all subjects dosed at >= 3 mg. A subset of mutants that confer a low level of reduced susceptibility to GS-5885 was not detected by population sequencing at the 30- and 90-mg doses. Subject-derived M28T, Q30R, L31M, and Y93C mutations all conferred >30-fold reductions in GS-5885 and daclatasvir susceptibilities in vitro. Site-directed NS5A mutants also showed reduced susceptibility to GS-5885. However, all NS5A mutants tested remained fully susceptible to other classes of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), interferon alpha, and ribavirin. Importantly, the nonoverlapping resistance profile and high potency of GS-5885 support its further development with other direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic HCV. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01193478.).

23744810|t|Tenofovir-emtricitabine therapy for the prevention of hepatitis B recurrence in four patients after liver transplantation.
23744810|a|In patients infected with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) that goes untreated, therapeutic options are limited once the disease decompensates, and orthotopic liver transplantation is often the only treatment available to save the patient's life. After liver transplantation, combined therapy with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and a nucleos(t)ide analog is the standard of practice for the prevention of HBV recurrence. Historically, nucleos(t)ide analogs such as lamivudine and adefovir have been used with low-dose HBIG for the prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation. However, these analogs are ineffective when used alone due the emergence of resistance mutations. Newer nucleos(t)ide analogs such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have demonstrated higher resistance thresholds and effective viral suppression when paired with low-dose HBIG. In this case series, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of switching four patients from low-dose HBIG plus nucleos(t)ide analog therapy for the prevention of HBV recurrence to a combination tenofovir-emtricitabine regimen. At the end of follow-up, all patients remained hepatitis B surface antigen negative and had HBV DNA levels of less than 10  IU/ml. Additionally, no tenofovir-associated nephrotoxicity was observed among the four patients. Tenofovir-emtricitabine monotherapy in lieu of HBIG plus nucleos(t)ide analog therapy demonstrated prevention of HBV recurrence without tenofovir-associated nephrotoxicity after 9  months of follow-up in all four patients and up to 15  months in one patient.

25029174|a|Five new flavonoids, cryptoconones A-E (1-5), along with six known compounds (6-11), were isolated from the stems of Cryptocarya concinna. The structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation, and the absolute configurations were determined via circular dichroism spectra and X-ray crystal analysis. The cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of these compounds were also evaluated. Compounds 9 and 10 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against HCT116, HT-29, SW480, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 6.25 to 9.35  µM. Compounds 8 and 11 exhibited antimicrobial activity against Fusarium moniliforme and Botrytis cinerea, respectively, with the same minimum inhibitory concentration of 5  µg/mL.

18158874|t|Dynamic effects of autophagy on arsenic trioxide-induced death of human leukemia cell line HL60 cells.
18158874|a|AIM: To evaluate the contribution of an autophagic mechanism to the As2O3- induced death of human acute myeloid leukaemia cell line HL60 cells. METHODS: The growth inhibition of HL60 cells induced by As2O3 was assessed with 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. The activation of autophagy was determined with monodansylcadaverine labeling and transmission electron microscope. The role of autophagy in the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells was assessed using autophagic and lysosomal inhibitors. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis were used to study the apoptotic and autophagic mechanisms. RESULTS: After treatment with As2O3, the proliferation of HL60 cells was significantly inhibited and the formation of autophagosomes increased. The blockade of autophagy maturation with the autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or the lysosome-neutralizing agent NH4Cl 1 h before As2O3 potentiated the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells. In contrast, 3-MA attenuated As2O3-induced death when administered 30 min after As2O3. 3-MA and NH4Cl also inhibited As2O3-induced upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, the protein required for autophagy in mammalian cells. Following As2O3, lysosomes were activated as indicated by increased levels of cathepsins B and L. The apoptotic response of HL60 cells to As2O3 was suggested by the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the activation of caspase-3. Pretreatment with 3-MA prior to As2O3 amplified these apoptotic signals, while posttreatment with 3-MA 30 min after As2O3 attenuated the apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: Autophagy plays complex roles in the As2O3-induced death of HL60 cells; it inhibits As2O3-induced apoptosis in the initiation stage, but amplifies the As2O3-mediated apoptotic program if it is persistently activated.

8792380|t|Adverse central nervous system effects of older antihistamines in children.
8792380|a|Although older, potentially sedating, "first-generation" antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are commonly used in childhood, their central nervous system (CNS) effects have not been well-documented in young subjects. We hypothesized that diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine would affect CNS function adversely in this population. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these medications on central and peripheral histamine H1-receptors in children. Fifteen subjects with allergic rhinitis were tested before and 2-2.5 h after administration of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo in a double-blind, single-dose, three-way crossover study. Impairment of cognitive processing was assessed objectively by the latency of the P300 event-related potential (P300). Somnolence was assessed subjectively by a visual analog scale. Peripheral H1-blockade was assessed by suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares. At the central (Cz) and frontal (Fz) electrodes, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine increased the P300 latency significantly (P < 0.05) compared to baseline. Hydroxyzine increased somnolence, as recorded on the visual analog scale, significantly compared to baseline (P < 0.05), with a similar trend for diphenhydramine (P = 0.07). Both antihistamines reduced histamine-induced wheals and flares significantly compared to baseline and compared to placebo. In children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are effective H1-receptor antagonists, but both these medications cause CNS dysfunction, as evidenced by increased P300 latency, a measure of cognitive function, and by increased subjective somnolence.

8343420|t|Incidence of renal stones among cadmium exposed battery workers.
8343420|a|The health effects of occupational exposure to cadmium were studied in a group of 902 workers employed for at least one year in a Swedish battery factory between 1931 and 1982. Data on air cadmium concentrations for different periods were combined with company employment records to obtain individual cumulative exposure estimates. A questionnaire including questions on the occurrence of kidney stones was sent to all 601 living workers and to the next of kin of 267 of the deceased workers. The response rate was 88%. 73 workers reported renal calculi that appeared after initial employment. A dose-response relation was found between cumulative exposure to cadmium and age standardised cumulative incidence. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were then computed for three exposure categories (< 250, 250- < 5000, and 5000 micrograms/m3 x years) standardised for calendar time, age, and smoking with the low exposure group as reference level. The IRRs were 1.0, 1.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-3.4], and 3.0 (95% CI 1.3-6.8) respectively. beta 2 Microglobulin measurements were available for 33 workers who formed stones; 13 of these workers had tubular proteinuria (beta 2 microglobulin > or = 34 micrograms/mmole creatinine)--that is, a prevalence of 39%. There was also an indication of a steeper dose-response relation among workers with tubular proteinuria.

23976766|t|Assessment of the physicochemical stability of all-in-one parenteral emulsions for neonates according to USP specifications.
23976766|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the methodology to assess the stability of all-in-one (AIO) parenteral nutrition admixtures, containing glucose, proteins, and lipids, to the standards of U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP <729>). The influence of calcium and commercially available lipid emulsions and amino acid solutions were also examined. METHODS: Four batches of 5 AIO admixtures containing calcium were compounded with commercially available lipid emulsions and amino acid solutions. Two of them contained calcium. Their stability was tested under conditions simulating clinical use. All the admixtures were assessed for criteria set by the USP <729>: (1) mean droplet diameter (MDD) and (2) percentage of volume weighted particles with diameter > 5 µm (PFAT5). RESULTS: All admixtures were within the specifications set by the USP with respect to the MDD at 0, 24, and 48 hours, but only those batches lacking calcium met the benchmarks set by the pharmacopoeia, with respect to PFAT5, on the day of preparation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of calcium destabilized the admixtures, while the use of different commercial ingredients altered the admixtures' characteristics. Only 1 batch of the AIO admixtures studied was found to be compliant with USP <729> standards.

23426615|a|CONTEXT: In recent years changes in screening strategies for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) led to an increased detection of mild forms of CH, associated with eutopic thyroid gland. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the clinical evolution of CH with eutopic thyroid gland and to find out prognostic factors at diagnosis and follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a group of 84 children with CH and eutopic thyroid gland treated at our institution. They all underwent clinical re-evaluation after the age of 3, based on thyroid function testing after l-thyroxine therapy withdrawal, thyroid ultrasonography, and (123)I scintigraphy with perchlorate discharge test. Genetic analysis was performed in selected cases. RESULTS: At re-evaluation, 34.5% of patients showed permanent hypothyroidism and needed l-thyroxine reintroduction, 27.4% had persistent hyperthyrotropinemia (TSH 5-10 mU/L), and 38.1% had transient hypothyroidism. Major risk factors for permanent CH were prematurity, first-degree familial history of goiter/nodules, thyroid hypoplasia at diagnosis, and high l-thyroxine requirements at follow-up. Iodine organification defects were found in 29.7% of patients, 30% of whom harbored DUOX2 mutations. TSH receptor gene mutations were found in 8.7% of patients with persistent thyroid dysfunction and negative perchlorate discharge test. CONCLUSIONS: Only one-third of patients with CH and eutopic thyroid gland needed to continue l-thyroxine therapy after re-evaluation. A frequent finding was the persistence of mild hyperthyrotropinemia. The evolution of CH remains difficult to predict, although different clinical features might suggest different outcomes. Mutations in the genes commonly linked to mild forms of CH were documented in a minority of cases.

23265189|t|Novel immunomodulatory compounds in multiple myeloma.
23265189|a|INTRODUCTION: The treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) remain limited. Immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, have changed the landscape in the treatment of patients with MM while newer IMiDs such as pomalidomide are showing promise in early clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the biologic rationales of IMiDs and the clinical results supporting their use in MM. It includes data on the new IMiD, pomalidomide and also explores the possible utility of combining IMiDs with other agents. A PubMed search and abstracts from oncology scientific meetings (ASCO and ASH) of articles related to IMiDs and MM was conducted. EXPERT OPINION: IMiDs have shown clinical activity as single agents and in combination. Thalidomide was the first in class drug. Lenalidomide has a better toxicity profile than thalidomide. Pomalidomide may overcome resistance to lenalidomide indicating differences in their mechanisms of action and resistance. Molecular biomarkers may allow us to identify patients who will respond to IMiDs.

12074575|t|Effects of a non-IGF binding mutant of IGFBP-5 on cell death in human breast cancer cells.
12074575|a|We have demonstrated previously that IGFBP-5 alone had no effect on cell death but modulated ceramide-induced apoptosis in Hs578T IGF non-responsive cells. To investigate if IGFBP-5 maintains its intrinsic ability to modulate apoptosis in IGF-responsive cells, we used a non-IGF binding mutant of IGFBP-5. In Hs578T cells, non-glycosylated, glycosylated or mutant IGFBP-5 alone each had no effect on cell death, whereas all forms inhibited ceramide-induced apoptosis. In IGF-responsive MCF-7 cells, each wild type form reduced ceramide-induced cell death but mutant IGFBP-5 was without effect. In the presence of mutant IGFBP-5, however, IGF-I no longer conferred survival and in the presence of wild type IGFBP-5, long R3 IGF-I was also unable to confer survival. In summary, all forms of IGFBP-5 modulated ceramide-induced apoptosis in Hs578T cells. In MCF-7 cells, IGF-I-induced survival could be facilitated by IGFBP-5, but also blocked by IGFBP-5 if association with IGFBP-5 was prevented.

11999564|t|Bendamustine mitoxantrone and rituximab (BMR): a new effective regimen for refractory or relapsed indolent lymphomas.
11999564|a|Bendamustine (B) and mitoxantrone (M) have been shown to be potent cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R) has produced an overall response rate (ORR) of 50% as a single agent in relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas. We posed the question whether a combination of the above agents (BMR) could improve these results. This study was an open label, single center pilot study for patients with relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive (indolent) lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The therapy consisted of bendamustine (80 mg/m2, day 1-3), mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2, day 1), rituximab (375 mg/m2, week 2-5). BM was repeated on day 36 or when the haematological parameters had recovered. The maximum therapy consisted of one BMR-cycle, followed by five BM courses. Treatment was stopped when the disease responded with PR/CR. During March 1999 and December 2000, 20 patients received the BMR-regimen (four secondary high grade lymphoma, 12 indolent lymphoma, four B-CLL). The median age of the patients was 67 years (range 36-82) and their performance status ranged from 0 to 3. Median number of previous treatment regimens was two (1-6). Of the lymphoma patients, 14 had stage IV disease, 1 stage III and 1 stage II. B-CLL patients were all Rai stage IV (Binet C). Overall response rate was 95% (19/20) with seven patients achieving a CR (35%) and 12 patients achieving a PR (60%). Median time to progression is 7 months (1-21) with a median observation time of 7 months (1-21). Response is still durable in 15/20 patients (75%) (1+ to 21+ months after therapy). Symptomatic, reversible grade three or four haematotoxicity occurred in 4/20 patients (20%). Non-symptomatic grade three or four haematotoxicity was seen in 9/20 patients (45%). No major non-haematological toxicity was observed. In conclusion, BMR is a well tolerated, very effective outpatient regimen of treatment for relapsed and refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies.

17296540|t|Treatments for late-life bipolar disorder.
17296540|a|BACKGROUND: Bipolar affective disorder is not uncommon in the elderly; prevalence rates in the United States range from 0.1% to 0.4%. However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to review the current literature on both the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management of late-life bipolar disorder. METHODS: English-language articles written on the treatment of bipolar disorder in the elderly were identified. The first step in data collection involved a search for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (up until the third quarter of 2006). Systematic reviews were then located in the following databases: MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), EMBASE (1980-2006 [week 36]), and PsycINFO (1967-September 2006 [week 1]). Additional use was made of these 3 databases in searching for single randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and case reports. "Elderly," used synonymously with "geriatric," was defined as individuals aged > or =60 years. However, to take into account ambiguity in the nomenclature, the key words aged, geriatric, elderly, and older were combined with words indicating pharmacologic treatments such as pharmacotherapy; classes of medications (eg, lithium, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines); and names of selected individual medications (eg, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, zonisamide, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole). These terms were then combined with the diagnostic terms bipolar disorder, mania, hypomania, depression, or bipolar depression. Finally, the terms ECT and psychotherapy were also queried in combination with indicators for age and diagnosis. A few articles on "older adults," usually defined as individuals aged 50 to 55 years, were also included. They may allow for possible extrapolation of data to the geriatric population. Additionally, several mixed-age studies were included for similar considerations. Case reports and case series were described for their potential heuristic value. RESULTS: Unfortunately, there is a considerable dearth of literature involving evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and even randomized controlled trials in elderly individuals with bipolar disorder. Available options for the treatment of bipolar disorder (including those for mania, hypomania, depression, or maintenance) in the elderly include lithium, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data for the treatment of late-life bipolar disorder are limited, but the available evidence shows efficacy for some commonly used treatments. Lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants have all been found to be beneficial in the treatment of elderly patients with bipolar disorder. Although there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of these patients, monotherapy followed by combination therapy of the various classes of drugs may help with the resolution of symptoms. ECT and psychotherapy may be useful in the treatment of refractory disease. There is a need for more controlled studies in this age group before definitive treatment strategies can be enumerated.

19249634|t|Sustained-release oral fampridine in multiple sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial.
19249634|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical studies suggested that fampridine (4-aminopyridine) improves motor function in people with multiple sclerosis. This phase III study assessed efficacy and safety of oral, sustained-release fampridine in people with ambulatory deficits due to multiple sclerosis. METHODS: We undertook a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, controlled phase III trial. We randomly assigned 301 patients with any type of multiple sclerosis to 14 weeks of treatment with either fampridine (10 mg twice daily; n=229) or placebo (n=72), using a computer-generated sequence stratified by centre. We used consistent improvement on timed 25-foot walk to define response, with proportion of timed walk responders in each treatment group as the primary outcome. We used the 12-item multiple sclerosis walking scale to validate the clinical significance of the response criterion. Efficacy analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat population (n=296), which included all patients with any post-treatment efficacy data. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00127530. FINDINGS: The proportion of timed walk responders was higher in the fampridine group (78/224 or 35%) than in the placebo group (6/72 or 8%; p<0.0001). Improvement in walking speed in fampridine-treated timed walk responders, which was maintained throughout the treatment period, was 25.2% (95% CI 21.5% to 28.8%) and 4.7% (1.0% to 8.4%) in the placebo group. Timed walk responders showed greater improvement in 12-item multiple sclerosis walking scale scores (-6.84, 95% CI -9.65 to -4.02) than timed walk non-responders (0.05, -1.48 to 1.57; p=0.0002). Safety data were consistent with previous studies. INTERPRETATION: Fampridine improved walking ability in some people with multiple sclerosis. This improvement was associated with a reduction of patients' reported ambulatory disability, and is a clinically meaningful therapeutic benefit.

22724458|t|Mesoporous silica nanoparticles in nanotechnology.
22724458|a|Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are a versatile drug delivery system that can be used for loading of different guest molecules such as peptides, proteins, anticancer agents, and genetic material. MSNs are considered promising drug carriers due to their tuneable particle size, pore structure, and surface functionalization. Thus, MSNs provide opportunities for their effective application in a wide variety of fields. In the current review, we discuss both conventional and advanced MSNs synthesis methods, including their applications for drug delivery, gatekeepers, and biosensors. In addition, the research progress in biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and internalization mechanisms is reported.

16468536|t|Hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane (Seprafilm) reduces early postoperative small bowel obstruction in gastrointestinal surgery.
16468536|a|This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose membrane (Seprafilm) on early postoperative small bowel obstruction (EPSBO). It also examined whether using Seprafilm affected surgical site infection rates in gastrointestinal surgery. One hundred eighty-four patients who had Seprafilm placed during gastrointestinal surgery between October 2000 and December 2003 were included in the study (Seprafilm group) and were compared with a matched cohort (control group) of patients operated on without Seprafilm. All patients were retrospectively assessed for EPSBO and surgical site infections. The incidence of EPSBO was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the Seprafilm group (12/184) than in the control group (26/183). The incidence of surgical site infection between the Seprafilm (15.2%) and control (13.7%) groups was not statistically significant. The placement of Seprafilm helped to prevent EPSBO and had no significant adverse affect on surgical site infections.

17540037|t|An assessment of serum leptin levels in patients with chronic viral hepatitis: a prospective study.
17540037|a|BACKGROUND: The role of leptin in the course of liver disease due to chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) remains controversial. Our aims were to investigate the relationship between serum leptin concentrations and the severity of liver disease in a cohort of subjects with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC) and to analyze the effect of body composition, the leptin system and insulin resistance together with viral factors on virologic response to antiviral treatment. METHODS: We studied 50 (36 men) consecutive patients suffering from biopsy-proven CVH due to HBV (n = 25) or HCV (n = 25) infection. Thirty-two (17 men) healthy volunteers served as controls. Levels of serum leptin and insulin were determined by immunoassays at baseline and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: A significant association between serum leptin levels and the stage of hepatic fibrosis was noted; patients with cirrhosis presented higher serum leptin levels compared to those with lower fibrosis stage [CHB patients (17436 pg/ml vs 6028.5 pg/ml, p = 0.03), CHC patients (18014 pg/ml vs 4385 pg/ml, p = 0.05]. An inverse correlation between lower leptin levels and response to lamivudine monotherapy was noted in patients with CHB; those with a virologic response presented lower serum leptin levels (5334 vs 13111.5 pg/ml; p-value = 0.003) than non-responders. In genotype 1 CHC patients, insulin resistance played a significant role in the response to antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data clearly suggest that cirrhosis due to CHB or CHC is associated with higher leptin levels. Increased serum leptin levels represent a negative prognostic factor for response to lamivudine monotherapy in patients with CHB. In CHC patients insulin resistance strongly influences the response to antiviral treatment in patients infected with genotype 1.

18973213|t|Aerosols and gaseous contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging of the lung.
18973213|a|Magnetic resonance imaging of lungs and the investigation of pulmonary pathologies with this technique are limited by low proton spin density, degraded magnetic homogeneity and motion. Inhaled contrast agents (gases or aerosols) can improve the diagnostic value of MRI for lung. Paramagnetic contrast agents such as gadolinium chelates aerosol or dioxygen gas increase the relaxivity of proton in lung parenchyma and can be used to assess the ventilated fraction of the bronchoalveolar space. Similarly, inhalation of non proton-MRI nuclei such as perfluorinated gas or hyperpolarized gases ((3)He or (129)Xe) can provide functional ventilation image. In this review paper, the principles, the practical implementation, the limitations and possible safety issues of these different techniques are summarized. The main pre-clinical and clinical applications of these approaches based on oral contrast agents are reviewed and illustrated with cutting-edge lung MRI studies.

10666980|t|Caffeine can affect velocity in the middle cerebral artery during hyperventilation, hypoventilation, and thinking: a transcranial Doppler study.
10666980|a|This study examined possible caffeine-mediated changes in blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (VMCA) induced by tests of cerebrovascular responsiveness. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography provided simultaneous bilateral VMCA measures while healthy college students hypoventilated, hyperventilated, and performed cognitive activities (short-term remembering, generating an autobiographical image, solving problems), each in 31-second tests. VMCA measures were obtained from the same persons, in separate testing sessions, when they were noncaffeinated and under two levels of caffeine: a smaller amount (from a cola, 45 mg/12 oz) and a larger amount (from coffee, 117 mg/8 oz). Compared with the no-caffeine control condition, a smaller amount of caffeine had no significant effects on global VMCA, but a larger amount suppressed VMCA by 5.8%. Time-course analyses showed that VMCA (1) followed a triphasic pattern to increase over baselines during hypoventilation regardless of caffeine condition, (2) slowed below baselines during hyperventilation (with the degree of slowing attenuated under caffeine), and (3) increased over baselines during all cognitive activities (ranges 3.8-6.9%). It is concluded that a large amount of caffeine can suppress VMCA, and this possibility should be anticipated when TCD is used to assess cerebral hemovelocity.

10888030|t|Impulsivity.
10888030|a|Disorders characterized by impulsivity include disorders of impulse control (intermittent explosive disorder, pyromania, kleptomania, pathological gambling and trichotillomania), paraphilias, sexual impulsions and sexual addictions and impulsive aggression personality disorders (borderline, antisocial, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders). Impulsivity has a substantial impact on both individuals and society. Impulse control disorders may be conceptualized as a subset of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. In this article, we examine the genetic and neurobiological aetiology of these disorders and possible treatment options. The link between serotonergic dysfunction and the pathophysiology of impulsivity is discussed, and studies that examine the efficacy of various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other alternatives in the treatment of impulsive disorders such as pathological gambling, sexual addictions and borderline personality disorder are presented.

20130857|t|Does amifostine have radioprotective effects on salivary glands in high-dose radioactive iodine-treated differentiated thyroid cancer.
20130857|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of amifostine on salivary glands in radioactive iodine-treated differentiated thyroid cancer. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled clinical trials which compared the effects of amifostine with those of placebo or acid-stimulating agents. RESULTS: Two randomized controlled clinical trials with a total of 130 patients were included. Both studies had a low risk of bias. There were no statistically significant differences between the effects of amifostine and acid-stimulating agents on the incidence of xerostomia (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.01 to 9.52), the decrease of scintigraphically measured uptake of (99m)Tc by the parotid (RR 0.30, 95% CI -2.28 to 2.88) or submandibular glands (RR 1.90, 95% CI -1.46 to 5.26) at 12 months, or the reduction in blood pressure (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 99.16). Neither of the included trials investigated death from any cause, morbidity, health-related quality of life or costs. CONCLUSION: The results of two randomized controlled clinical trials suggest that amifostine has no significant radioprotective effects on salivary glands in radioactive iodine treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer. The use of acid-stimulating agents to increase salivation should remain the first choice during radioactive iodine treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer. Patients should also be well informed of the importance of hydration and acid stimulation.

18772934|t|Variation of cell surface hydrophobicity and biofilm formation among genotypes of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis under antifungal treatment.
18772934|a|Candida infections are frequently associated with formation of biofilms on artificial medical devices. This work studied variation of cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and formation of biofilm in relation to Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis genotypes and an effect of some conventional antifungal agents on both CSH and biofilm. The 50 isolates of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis were classified into genotypes A, B, C, and D, genotype D being exclusively represented by C. dubliniensis. No significant differences between CSH of genotypes A and B and B and C were observed with respect to cultivation temperature 25 or 37 degrees C. Candida dubliniensis showed increased CSH in comparison with other C. albicans genotypes (p < 0.001) regardless of temperature used. Using XTT reduction assay and dry masses, genotypes B and C showed reduced ability to form biofilm in comparison with genotype A (p < 0.05) and C. dubliniensis (p < 0.001). Fluconazole reduced biofilm in C. albicans genotypes A, B, and C (p < 0.05) but not CSH. The opposite effect was observed in C. dubliniensis. Voriconazole effectively reduced both biofilm formation and CSH in all tested genotypes of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis (p < 0.05).

10332937|t|Clinical benefits of a new piperidine-class AChE inhibitor.
10332937|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a deficiency of acetylcholine (ACh) in the forebrain that correlates with brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction. The most promising approach to enhancing central ACh neurotransmission has been the utilization of agents that inhibit cholinesterases which block its catabolism. Initially, the success of this strategy was limited by subtherapeutic levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, tolerability problems and toxicity of the first agents. Donepezil HCI represents a new chemical class of AChE inhibitors, the piperidines. In clinical trials, donepezil has been shown to improve significantly cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderately severe AD, and has demonstrated an excellent tolerability and safety profile. These benefits, as well as a simple, once-daily dosing regimen, make donepezil a viable therapeutic option for AD patients.

21495939|t|Predictors of deferral of treatment for hepatitis C infection in Australian clinics.
21495939|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine uptake of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and predictors of deferral of treatment for HCV by using prospectively collected data from the Australian Chronic Hepatitis C Observational Study (ACHOS). DESIGN, PATIENTS AND SETTING: Cohort study involving interview and medical record review at enrolment and routine follow-up clinic visits of patients with chronic HCV and compensated liver disease attending a national network of 24 HCV clinics between April 2008 and December 2009. Eligible patients were those who had not been previously treated, were enrolled within 6 months of their first clinic visit, were eligible for treatment and had been enrolled for at least 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Predictors of patients undergoing HCV treatment within the first 6 months of assessment. RESULTS: 1239 patients were enrolled in ACHOS, of whom 406 met the criteria for inclusion in the subcohort for this study. Among this subcohort, 171 (42%) received treatment within 6 months of their first clinic visit. Current injecting drug use (odds ratio [OR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.77), past and current treatment for drug dependency (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.67, and OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.81, respectively) and alcohol use above 20 g/day (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.46) were independent predictors of deferral of treatment. At least one of these factors applied to 41% of the subcohort. Clinical factors, including HCV genotype, HCV RNA level, and stage of liver disease were not associated with deferral of treatment for HCV. CONCLUSION: Factors related to drug and alcohol use, rather than clinical factors, influenced uptake of treatment for HCV. Further support for patients with drug and alcohol dependency is required to optimise treatment uptake.

18463509|t|Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab combined with verteporfin photodynamic therapy for choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration.
18463509|a|PURPOSE: To report the outcome for eyes treated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab combined with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Interventional, consecutive, retrospective case series including 40 eyes of 40 patients with newly diagnosed juxtafoveal or subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. METHODS: The charts of patients treated with a 1.25-mg intravitreal injection of bevacizumab followed by PDT within a 2-week period were reviewed. Main outcome measures were visual acuity stabilization (defined as no change or a gain in visual acuity) and need for retreatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three (83%) of 40 eyes had stabilization of visual acuity. Mean improvement in visual acuity was 1.73 lines. Twenty-six eyes (65%) required only a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab combined with PDT. Of the 23 eyes with 12 months of follow-up, 17 (74%) had stabilization of visual acuity, while 9 (40%) had improvement in visual acuity (mean, 1.22 Snellen lines). Eleven eyes (48%) required only a single combined treatment for CNV resolution at the 12-month follow-up. Fifteen (88%) of 17 eyes with only 6 months of follow-up required only a single combined treatment. There were no complications such as endophthalmitis, uveitis, or ocular hypertension. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that eyes treated with both intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and PDT require none to a minimal number of re-treatments to have stabilization of vision, even at 12 months of follow-up. Further investigation with large controlled trials is warranted to outline the appropriate treatment paradigm for combination therapy.

19716209|t|Self organizing molecular field analysis on a series of human 5alpha-reductase inhibitors: unsaturated 3-carboxysteroid.
19716209|a|Steroidal 5alpha-reductase is a NADPH dependent enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 4-en-3-oxo-steroid testosterone to the corresponding 5alpha-H-3-oxo-steroid dihydrotestosterone thus involved in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). As the crystal structure of target enzyme is not available; we have carried out ligand based designing using Self Organizing Molecular Field Analysis (SOMFA). SOMFA, a novel 3D-QSAR methodology used in present case to study the correlation between molecular properties and human 5alpha-reductase inhibitory activities of a series of unsaturated 3-carboxysteroid. The statistical results, good cross-validated r(2)(cv) (0.693) and non cross-validated r(2) (0.732), showed satisfied predictive ability. All analysis of SOMFA model may provide some useful information in the design of human steroidal 5alpha-reductase inhibitors with better spectrum of activity.

19053755|a|In prior investigation, we discovered that (3'R,4'R)-3-cyanomethyl-4-methyl-3',4'-di-O-(S)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (4, 3-cyanomethyl-4-methyl-DCK) showed promising anti-HIV activity. In these current studies, we developed and optimized successfully a practical 10-step synthesis for scale-up preparation to increase the overall yield of 4 from 7.8% to 32%. Furthermore, compound 4 exhibited broad-spectrum anti-HIV activity against wild-type and drug-resistant viral infection of CD4+ T cell lines as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells by both laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates with distinct subtypes and tropisms. Compound 4 was further subjected to in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. These studies indicated that 4 has moderate cell permeability, moderate oral bioavailability, and low systemic clearance. These results suggest that 4 should be developed as a promising anti-HIV agent for development as a clinical trial candidate.

21883230|t|Molecular events associated with ciclosporin A-induced gingival overgrowth are attenuated by Smad7 overexpression in fibroblasts.
21883230|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ciclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth is attributed to an exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix, which is mainly due to an increased expression of transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1). Herein, the in vitro investigation of effects of overexpression of Smad7, a TGF-b1 signaling inhibitor, in the events associated with CsA-induced extracellular matrix accumulation was performed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effects of Smad7 were assessed by stable overexpression of Smad7 in fibroblasts from normal gingiva. Smad7-overexpressing cells and control cells were incubated with CsA, and synthesis of type I collagen, production and activity of MMP-2 and cellular proliferation were evaluated by ELISA, zymography, growth curve, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay and cell cycle analysis. The effects of CsA on cell viability and apoptosis of fibroblasts from normal gingiva were also evaluated. Western blot and immunofluorescence for phospho-Smad2 were performed to measure the activation of TGF-b1 signaling. RESULTS: Although the treatment with CsA stimulated TGF-b1 production in both control and Smad7-overexpressing fibroblasts, its signaling was markedly inhibited in Smad7-overexpressing cells, as revealed by low levels of phospho-Smad2. In Smad7-overexpressing cells, the effects of CsA on proliferation, synthesis of type I collagen and the production and activity of MMP-2 were significantly blocked. Smad7 overexpression blocked CsA-induced fibroblast proliferation via p27 regulation. Neither CsA nor Smad7 overexpression induced cell death. CONCLUSION: The data presented here confirm that TGF-b1 expression is related to the molecular events associated with CsA-induced gingival overgrowth and suggest that Smad7 overexpression is effective in blocking these events, including proliferation, type I collagen synthesis and MMP-2 activity.

16617642|t|Dynamic airflow limitation after topical anaesthesia of the upper airway.
16617642|a|This prospective before-and-after observational study investigated the effect of upper airway anaesthesia on dynamic airflow. Six consenting ASA 1 adults, all authors of this study, underwent a series of spirometric measurements before and after topical anaesthesia of the upper airway using lignocaine. Peak inspiratory flow rate, forced inspiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the maximum inhaled volume, forced expiratory volume at 1 second, and forced vital capacity in the supine and sitting positions were measured. The measured inspiratory parameters were significantly reduced after lignocaine topical anaesthesia of the upper airway. Expiratory flow parameters were not affected. We conclude that topical anaesthesia of the upper airway leads to dynamic inspiratory airflow limitation.

21768515|t|Pyrazinamide susceptibility testing in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a systematic review with meta-analyses.
21768515|a|Standard culture-based testing of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is difficult to perform. This systematic review with meta-analyses evaluated the roles of molecular assays targeting pncA and of pyrazinamidase assays. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant publications in English. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated in bivariate random-effects models. Of 128 articles identified, 73 sets of data involving culture isolates were initially included in meta-analyses. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 87% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 29), 75% and 95% for PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (n = 5), 96% and 97% for a mixture of other molecular assays (n = 6), and 89% and 97% for pyrazinamidase assays using the Wayne method (n = 33). The median prevalence (range) of pyrazinamide resistance was 51% (31% to 89%) in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and 5% (0% to 9%) in non-multidrug-resistant isolates. Excluding studies with possibly considerable false resistance in the reference assay gave the following estimates of sensitivity and specificity, respectively: 92% and 93% for PCR-DNA sequencing (n = 20), 98% and 96% for other molecular assays (n = 5), and 91% and 97% for the Wayne assay (n = 27). The Wayne assay had significant funnel plot asymmetry, so the test performance might have been overestimated. Considering the prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in different clinical settings, PCR-DNA sequencing, and possibly other molecular assays targeting pncA, can detect pyrazinamide resistance in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, with predictive values largely exceeding 90%, and rule out pyrazinamide resistance in non-multidrug-resistant isolates, with predictive values exceeding 99%. Molecular assays are probably the way forward for detecting pyrazinamide resistance.

2246945|t|Chlamydial infections.
2246945|a|Chlamydia trachomatis is a unique intracellular parasite that causes a number of common sexually transmitted disease syndromes, including nongonococcal urethritis in both men and women, epididymitis in men, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Infants exposed at delivery are at risk for the development of conjunctivitis and pneumonia. There is strong evidence that Chlamydia is a cause of obstructive infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women. It appears that these complications result from the chronic inflammatory response and secondary scarring that are elicited by long-term asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic fallopian tube infections. Because treatment with tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin is simple, effective, and inexpensive, major efforts should be put into identifying asymptomatic young women through screening of the subpopulations at highest risk. These include sexually active adolescent women and older women who are not monogamous. Blacks are at higher risk than other ethnic groups for infection. The cost of diagnosing chlamydial infection has decreased with the introduction of new nonculture diagnostic tests. This should increase the availability of testing for screening purposes. It is critical to remember that male sex partners of infected women must be treated; otherwise all efforts to prevent long-term complications by identifying and treating asymptomatic women are doomed to failure.

17879500|a|The endocannabinoid system (EC) plays a significant role in appetite drive and associated behaviours. Therefore attenuation of the activity of the EC system would have therapeutic benefit in treating disorders that might have a component of excess appetite drive or over-activity of the endocannabinoid system, such as obesity, ethanol and other drug abuse, and a variety of central nervous system and other disorders. Antagonists of cannabinoid receptors have been designed through rational drug discovery essential to exploit these novel targets for potential in obesity, metabolism, addiction, pain and neurologic disorders. Rimonabant is the only compound in this group which along this pathway is now approved as a selective CB (1) (cannabinoid receptor subtype 1) antagonist, or inverse agonist, in the European Union and India and under regulatory review in the United States for the treatment of obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk.

23869810|t|Polymer-based cancer nanotheranostics: retrospectives of multi-functionalities and pharmacokinetics.
23869810|a|The pressing need for targeting, detecting, monitoring, and treating diseased cells concomitantly gives rise to multi-functional nanomedicines, especially those that can combine diagnostic and therapeutic abilities, which are referred to as nanotheranostics. Recently, nanotheranostics are of significant clinical interest as these nanomedicines offer new opportunities to directly visualize drug blood circulation and biodistribution, thus facilitating the development of more personalized treatment regimens. To date, much research has shown the exciting potential of nanotheranostics in cancer therapy and imaging. In particular, the advancements of polymeric nanomaterials in the past decades have paved the way for the development of cancer nanotheranostics that are primarily comprised of polymers or conjugates of polymer and other types of nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Additionally, to improve the therapeutic and diagnostic efficiency of cancer nanotheranostics, various strategies have been utilized to provide targeted-delivery across biological barriers and environmental-responsive delivery, leading to the alteration of pharmacokinetics such as drug distribution, cellular partition, and elimination routes. In this review, we will summarize recent development of polymer-based cancer nanotheranostics and some novel strategies to improve their pharmacokinetics, especially biodistribution, followed by a brief discussion of their applications in cancer therapies as well as their toxicity and safety.

21279402|t|Effect of a newly synthesized Zn sulfophthalocyanine derivative on cell morphology, viability, proliferation, and cytotoxicity in a human lung cancer cell line (A549).
21279402|a|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemotherapeutic process that is used for the treatment of cancer. Photofrin is the most widely used photosensitizer, however, the chemical composition of Photofrin is unclear and it has a low absorption in the therapeutic wavelength (600-900  nm). This factor has stimulated research in synthesis and testing of new photosensitizers. This in vitro study evaluated the effectiveness of a Zn sulfophthalocyanine (ZnPcS(mix)) as a potential photosensitizer in the treatment of human lung cancer. Lung cancer cells (A549) were divided into four groups: group 1 was control cells receiving neither light nor drug; group 2 was light control for cells exposed to laser irradiation at a fluence of 4.98  J/cm(2); group 3 was drug control for cells incubated with 15.8  µM photosensitizer and not exposed to laser irradiation, while group 4 was cells receiving the experimental treatment with 15.8  µM photosensitizer and irradiation with 4.98  J/cm(2). Laser irradiations were performed using a 636-nm diode laser with an output power of 110  mW at 4.98  J/cm(2). Changes in cellular responses were evaluated by cell morphology, viability, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. While control groups 1, 2, and 3 showed no changes in cell morphology, viability, proliferation, or cytotoxicity, group 4 receiving both photosensitizer and irradiation showed changes in cell morphology, a decrease in cell viability and proliferation, and an increase in cytotoxicity, cell death, and cell membrane damage. Irradiation or photosensitizer alone had no effect on the lung cancer cells since the cells remained viable and showed no evidence of damage. However, irradiation in the presence of a photosensitizer induced cell death.

11230476|t|Duration of chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized trial of three versus six courses of mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin.
11230476|a|PURPOSE: So far there are no published data on optimal duration of chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); six or more courses are usually recommended. We have carried out a multicenter randomized trial comparing three versus six courses of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC were randomized at start of treatment to receive either three or six courses of mitomycin 8 mg/m(2) (courses 1, 2, 4, and 6), vinblastine 6 mg/m(2), and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) (MVP) every 21 days. Treatment was stopped early in both arms for progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Key end points were overall survival, duration of symptom relief, and quality-of-life assessment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire QLQ-C30 with lung cancer-specific module QLQ-LC13. RESULTS: Three hundred eight patients were randomized. Seventy-two percent of the 155 patients randomized to three courses completed treatment. In the 153 patients randomized to six courses, 73% completed three courses and 31% six courses. Median survival was 6 versus 7 months, respectively, and 1-year survival 22% versus 25% (P =.2). Median duration of symptom relief was 4.5 months (both arms), and 8% versus 18% had continuing symptom relief (P =.4). Quality-of-life parameters were the same or improved for patients randomized to only three courses, including significantly decreased fatigue (P =.03) and a trend toward decreased nausea and vomiting (P =.06). CONCLUSION: Our findings show no evidence for additional clinical benefit by continuing MVP chemotherapy beyond three courses. This challenges current orthodoxy of six courses or more. Further trials addressing duration of chemotherapy are now warranted, particularly with newer chemotherapy schedules.

15215876|t|Imatinib therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia: strategies to avoid and overcome resistance.
15215876|a|Imatinib is a molecularly targeted therapy that inhibits the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL, the tyrosine kinase involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Selective inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of CML, particularly in chronic phase. Some patients, however, primarily those with advanced disease, are either refractory to imatinib or eventually relapse. Relapse with imatinib frequently depends not only on re-emergence of BCR-ABL kinase activity but may also indicate BCR-ABL-independent disease progression not amenable to imatinib inhibition. Results from phase 2/3 trials suggest that rates of resistance and relapse correlate with the stage of disease and with the monitoring parameters--hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular response. These observations and more recent trials with imatinib, combined with insights provided by an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance, have established the rationale for strategies to avoid and overcome imatinib resistance in the management of CML patients. To prevent resistance, early diagnosis and prompt treatment with appropriate initial dosing is essential. Management of resistance may include therapeutic strategies such as dose escalation to achieve individual optimal levels, combination therapy, as well as treatment interruption.

9921434|t|Postoperative hepatic dysfunction in perspective. 1970.
9921434|a|Postoperative hepatic dysfunction will remain a difficult entity to place in perspective until increased data are obtained from prospective clinical trials. Ideally these data should compare hepatic dysfunction not only to other postoperative complications, both with regard to overall incidence and to mortality, but also to the overall risks of anesthesia and surgery. The contribution of drug-induced hepatic damage to postoperative hepatic dysfunction has remained unsettled since chloroform was first incriminated during the nineteenth century. The drug was condemned in 1912, without any attempt being made to determine the incidence of the so-called delayed chloroform poisoning, with the result that the drug is still in use and the chloroform controversy remains unsettled to this day. The halothane controversy is also unsettled and currently overshadows the former controversy, although academically of no greater importance. Although not an anesthetic, cincophen is another drug about which there is controversy concerning its hepatotoxic potential. Babior and Davidson noted that it was the first drug implicated in hepatic necrosis--presumably with the exception of chloroform--the first report appearing in 1922. In 1941 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association concluded that the case against cincophen was not proved and that an urgent need existed for controlled clinical studies. Twenty-five years later Babior and Davidson noted that such studies had still not been undertaken and that the situation was the same as it was a quarter of a century earlier. Perhaps the time has come for a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to be undertaken so as to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of one of these drugs. Perhaps an anesthetic agent such as halothane, concerning multiple administrations of which there is currently serious question, would be a suitable choice for such a study. The drug is in wide use today, partly because of evidence of satisfactory death rates following its administration, but also because on the basis of much excellent physiological data--but an almost total lack of any confirmatory epidemiological evidence--it is thought to contribute positively toward a low overall incidence of postoperative morbidity. Perhaps in addition, as a corollary, the time has come when, as attempts to illuminate a well--enunciated problem of this nature--that is, to test a clearly formulated hypothesis--the isolated case report, the collection of isolated case reports, the series of patients reported in the absence of a proven comparable control group, and the uncontrolled survey, should be "laid to rest." At best they provide only additional hypothesis-formulating information. At worst, however, they give increased exposure to a suggestion concerning cause and effect upon which physicians may act to their patients' detriment if the hypothesis ultimately proves to be erroneous. MacMahon et al. have stated that although there is no clear-cut dividing line between descriptive and analytical epidemiology, most epidemiological studies can indeed be classified primarily as either hypothesis-formulating or hypothesis-testing. Just as we have conducted the definitive retrospective hypothesis-testing study--the National Halothane Study--demanded by the "halothane hepatitis" controversy, so must we now move to the final stage of epidemiological investigation (experimental epidemiology) by investigating the effects of multiple administrations of the drug. On this point the National Halothane Study acts more as a hypothesis-formulating study than as a hypothesis-testing study. Hill has noted that statistical problems must be dealt with by the statistical method. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

16006690|t|Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with gemcitabine: a case report and review of literature.
16006690|a|CONTEXT: Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare condition compromising the clinical triad of acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be associated with a variety of etiologies, and chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, including mitomycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, and most recently gemcitabine. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old Caucasian male treated with four cycles of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 developed clinical and laboratory findings compatible with hemolytic uremic syndrome. He developed microangiopathic hemolysis, rapidly declining renal function with proteinuria and hematuria, and renal biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. Hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, and corticosteroid therapy were utilized but the process ultimately was irreversible. CONCLUSION: With multiple reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome complicating gemcitabine therapy, it is imperative that clinicians heighten their awareness of this potentially lethal complication.

22773546|t|A systematic approach to therapeutic target selection in oesophago-gastric cancer.
22773546|a|OBJECTIVE: The success of personalised therapy depends on identification and inhibition of the oncogene(s) on which that tumour is dependent. We aimed to determine whether a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array could be used to select the most effective therapeutic strategies in molecularly heterogeneous oesophago-gastric adenocarcinomas. DESIGN: Gene expression profiling from oesophago-gastric tumours (n=75) and preinvasive stages (n=57) identified the active signalling pathways, which was confirmed using immunohistochemistry (n=434). RTK arrays on a cell line panel (n=14) determined therapeutic targets for in vitro cytotoxic testing. Feasibility of this personalised approach was tested in tumour samples (n=46). RESULTS: MAPK was the most frequently activated pathway (32/75 samples (42.7%)) with progressive enrichment in preinvasive disease stages (p<0.05) and ERK phosphorylation in 148/434 (34.3%) independent samples. Cell lines displayed a range of RTK activation profiles. When no RTKs were activated, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and a Mek inhibitor were not useful (MKN1). In lines with a dominant phosphorylated RTK (OE19, MKN45 and KATOIII), selection of this TKI or Mek in nM concentrations induced cytotoxicity and inhibited Erk and Akt phosphorylation. In cells lines with complex activation profiles (HSC39 and OE33), a combination of TKIs or Mek inhibition (in nM concentrations) was necessary for cytotoxicity and inhibition of Erk and Akt phosphorylation. Human tumours demonstrated diverse activation profiles and 65% of cases had two or more active RTKs. CONCLUSIONS: The MAPK pathway is commonly activated in oesophago-gastric cancer following activation of a variety of RTKs. Molecular phenotyping can inform a rational choice of targeted therapy.

7882601|t|Effects of age and sex on sodium chloride sensitivity: association with plasma renin activity.
7882601|a|The mechanism by which excessive NaCl intake raises blood pressure has not been fully clarified. The present study was undertaken in 87 Japanese inpatients with essential hypertension to investigate the interrelation among effects of age, sex and the renin-angiotensin system on NaCl sensitivity. After ingesting a regular NaCl diet (170 mmol/day) for one week, subjects were placed sequentially on a week of low NaCl diet (50 mmol/day) and a week of high NaCl diet (340 mmol/day). NaCl sensitivity defined as the difference in mean blood pressure between the low and high NaCl diets did not differ between genders. NaCl sensitivity was positively correlated with age and the change in PRA. The fall in PRA after NaCl loading was significantly smaller in women than in men. By multiple regression analysis, age and the change in PRA independently contributed to the change in mean blood pressure. Furthermore, the interaction between sex and the change in PRA was selected as a statistically significant variable. In conclusion, NaCl sensitivity of blood pressure is independently associated with age and the inadequate suppression of the renin-angiotensin system. Because the contribution of the change in PRA to NaCl sensitivity was greater in women than in men, the mechanism of blood pressure elevation after NaCl loading may differ between genders.

24081314|t|Drugs for cognitive loss and dementia.
24081314|a|The drugs currently available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias can provide limited symptomatic improvement. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine and the NMDA-receptor antagonist memantine have produced modest but apparently persistent improvements in cognition, activities of daily living, and behavior in patients with disease severity ranging from mild to severe. Among the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, transdermal rivastigmine causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the oral formulation. Whether adding memantine to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is more effective than an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor alone remains to be established; clinical trial results have been mixed. None of these agents have been shown to stop or reverse the underlying neurodegenerative process.

21510504|t|GPs should be vigilant for pelvic inflammatory disease.
21510504|a|Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) typically results from ascending infection through the endocervix, from the lower to the upper genital tract. This leads to inflammation of the endometrium, uterus, fallopian tubes, adnexal structures or pelvic peritoneum. PID accounts for one in 60 GP consultations by women under 45. The long-term effects of PID include chronic pelvic pain, subfertility and ectopic pregnancy. The most common cause of PID is sexually transmitted infection. Patients with PID may be asymptomatic or may present with a spectrum of symptoms including: lower abdominal pain (typically bilateral, sometimes radiating to the legs, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge (often purulent), dysuria, deep dyspareunia and abnormal vaginal bleeding (postcoital, intermenstrual and breakthrough). A general, abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed. Outpatient therapy is considered to be as effective as inpatient treatment for patients with clinically mild to moderate PID. Most clinical trial data support the use of IM cefoxitin, however, as this drug is not readily available in the U.K. ceftriaxone has been deemed a suitable alternative. Metronidazole is usually included in most outpatient regimens to cover for the presence of anaerobes. The duration of outpatient treatment is usually 14 days. Patients should be told to avoid any form of sexual intercourse until they, and their partner(s) have completed their full course of treatment.

19583683|t|Complete atrioventricular block associated with dapsone therapy: a rare complication of dapsone-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.
19583683|a|Dapsone is still widely used for a range of infectious and inflammatory diseases. A potential severe side-effect, known as dapsone-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS), may occur. DHS is characterized by fever, skin rashes, lymphadenopathy and multiorgan dysfunction manifesting as hepatitis, cholangitis, pneumonitis, colitis, thyroiditis and myocarditis. However, DHS-associated complete atrioventricular block has not previously been reported. We describe here a 45-year-old Chinese woman who developed DHS after 5 weeks of dapsone therapy for pustular palmoplantar psoriasis. In addition to typical DHS symptoms, she experienced several episodes of syncope as a result of complete atrioventricular block which was successfully reversed with a permanent pacemaker implantation.

22303523|t|The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) task force recommendations for the management of patients with mood disorders and comorbid metabolic disorders.
22303523|a|BACKGROUND: One goal of the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) is to develop evidence-based and best practice educational programs and recommendations. Our group conducted a comprehensive literature review to provide evidence-based recommendations for treating metabolic comorbidity in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). METHODS: We searched PubMed for all English-language articles published January 1966 to November 2010 using BD and MDD cross-referenced with metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. That search was augmented by a review of articles reporting outcomes of an intervention targeting components of metabolic syndrome in individuals with MDD or BD. RESULTS: Consensus exists for the recommendation that individuals with MDD and BD should be routinely screened for risk factors that increase risk for metabolic syndrome. For excess weight, the best-studied pharmacologic approaches are metformin and topiramate, with emerging evidence for liraglutide and modafinil. For binge eating disorder, the best evidence in mood disorders was for cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as topiramate, zonisamide, and in select cases selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, evidence supports cognitive-behavioral interventions and anti-diabetic, antilipidemic, and antihypertensive treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive care of individuals with mood disorders should include routine evaluation of the risk and presence of metabolic syndrome and its components. Systematic evaluation of preventative and targeted treatments of metabolic syndrome in mood disorder populations is insufficient.

9226599|t|Cardiovascular disease and sleep-related erections.
9226599|a|Sexual difficulties are highly prevalent in male patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and hypercholesterolemia. Recently, several studies have been conducted on the effects of cardiovascular diseases, as well as associated drug and nondrug treatments, on nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) and other measures of sexual function. Although an overall trend has been observed toward decreased NPT in patients with chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions, design and methodological difficulties have been noted in most studies, and results have been generally, inconclusive. Similarly, antihypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers and diuretics have been associated with diminished NPT in several studies, although methodological problems have again been noted. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of antihypertensive drugs on sleep-related erections has not been determined. Most recently, a positive effect of cholesterol-lowering drugs (pravastatin, lovastatin) on NPT has been observed in middle-aged males with chronic hypercholesterolemia. Additional studies of the effects of cardiovascular disease on NPT and other measures of sexual function are needed.

17249213|t|Changes in some metalloenzymes and trace metals among workers occupationally exposed to lead in battery manufacture.
17249213|a|The present study was conducted aiming to evaluate the impact of lead [Pb] exposure on the activities of some metaloenzymes as TIBC, SOD, ALP and MAO and their related trace metals among workers. Ninety workers occupationally exposed to Pb in a battery manufacturing plant in Alexandria city were included in this study, 50 of them were the exposed group and 40 control subjects. The present study showed a statistically significant higher level of biological indices of exposure (p < 0.01) of lead in blood among the exposed group than the control subjects. Exposure to Pb led to decreased levels of Zn and Fe which was accompanied by increase in the level of TIBC and decrease in activity of ALP. However, no significant variation could be detected in the level of Cu and its metalloenzyme as SOD and MAO between exposed and control subjects.

23185923|t|Analgesic effect of intrathecal neostigmine combined with bupivacaine and fentanyl.
23185923|a|BACKGROUND: The spinal route of analgesia has consolidated its place as a major modality in the management of both acute and chronic pain. The search for ideal additives to local anaesthetic agents to prolong the analgesic effects poses a challenge to the anaesthetists. Neostigmine, an anticholinesterase, presents a novel approach to providing analgesia. Neostigmine, when given intrathecally, inhibits breakdown of an endogenous spinal neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, thereby inducing analgesia. We aimed to determine the analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal neostigmine combined with hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl. METHOD: Sixty male adults, ASA I-II requiring lower abdominal surgical procedures under spinal anaesthesia were randomly allocated to 2 groups: Neostigmine group, received intrathecal (IT) 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 15 mg, fentanyl 25 microg and preservative-free neostigmine 25 microg while saline group, received same dose of bupivacaine and fentanyl plus 0.5 ml saline. The duration of analgesia, time to use first rescue analgesics and the incidence of adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: The mean duration of effective analgesia was 485.6 +/- 37.6 minutes in neostigmine group compared with saline group, 316.0 +/- 49.15 minutes, p < 0.001. Total analgesic consumption 12 hours post-intrathecal injection was also less in the neostigmine group. The incidence of adverse effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were not statistically significant in both groups, p > 0.05. CONCLUSION: This study showed that spinal neostigmine 25 microg added to hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl provided a significantly longer surgical analgesia and insignificant adverse effects in male adults who had lower abdominal surgery under spinal anaesthesia.

8612858|t|Midluteal buserelin is superior to early follicular phase buserelin in combined gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and gonadotropin stimulation in in vitro fertilization.
8612858|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish whether time to down-regulation and pregnancy and live birth rates were different when buserelin acetate was started in the midluteal phase or early follicular phase in IVF-ET patients. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomized, parallel-group multicenter clinical study. SETTING: Women attending seven infertility clinics. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-four women with tubal or unexplained infertility with normal menstruation and fertile partners. INTERVENTIONS: Intranasal buserelin acetate started in the midluteal or early follicular phase combined with standard hMG and hCG stimulation after achievement of down-regulation. Established IVF-ET methods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of down-regulation; clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimations of the duration of down-regulation were 15.5 days when buserelin acetate was started in the early follicular phase (127 cycles) and 14.6 days when it was started in the midluteal phase (96 cycles). This difference was statistically significant. The pregnancy rates per first treatment cycle, treatment cycle, oocyte retrieval, and ET were significantly higher when buserelin acetate was started in the midluteal phase. The live birth rates were also higher, but only significantly so for the rate per first treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates are better when buserelin acetate is started in the midluteal phase rather than the early follicle phase before hMG and hCG stimulation in preparation for IVF-ET.

24338277|t|Activity of the hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 in hypoxic and perivascular regions of solid tumors and its potential to enhance therapeutic effects of chemotherapy.
24338277|a|Many chemotherapy drugs have poor therapeutic activity in regions distant from tumor blood vessels because of poor tissue penetration and low cytotoxic activity against slowly-proliferating cells. The hypoxia-activated pro-drug TH-302 may have selective toxicity for hypoxic and neighboring cells in tumors. Here we characterize the spatial distribution and ability of TH-302 to selectively target hypoxic regions and complement the effect of doxorubicin and docetaxel by modifying biomarker distribution. Athymic nude mice bearing human breast MCF-7 or prostate PC-3 tumors were treated with doxorubicin or docetaxel respectively and TH-302 alone or in combination. Biomarkers of drug effect including yH2aX (a marker of DNA damage), cleaved caspase-3 or -6 (markers of apoptosis) and reduction in Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation) were quantified in tumor sections in relation to functional blood vessels (recognized by DiOC7) and hypoxia (recognized by EF5) using immunohistochemistry. yH2aX expression at 10 min and cleaved caspase-3 or -6 at 24 hr after doxorubicin or docetaxel decreased with increasing distance from tumor blood vessels, with minimal expression in hypoxic regions; maximum reduction in Ki67 levels was observed in regions closest to vasculature at 24 hr. TH-302 induced maximal cell damage in hypoxic and neighboring regions, but was also active in tumor regions closer to blood vessels. TH-302 given 4 hr before doxorubicin or docetaxel increased DNA damage and apoptosis throughout the tumor compared to chemotherapy alone. When given with doxorubicin or docetaxel, TH-302 complements and enhances anticancer effects in both perivascular and hypoxic regions but also increases toxicity.

23894901|t|Liver histology of chronic hepatitis C patients who relapsed or not responded to conventional interferon and ribavirin therapy.
23894901|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate liver histology of chronic hepatitis C patients, who were relapsers or non-responders to previous conventional therapy. METHODS: The descriptive case series was conducted in the Hepatology section of Medical Unit-III at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan, from January to December 2008. The study had 109 hepatitis C patients who had relapsed or not responded to the conventional interferon and ribavirin for at least 24 weeks. All the patients were subjected to liver biopsy. The inflammatory activity and fibrosis shown by the liver biopsies were assessed according to the Batts-Ludwig classification. SPSS version 15 was used to analyse data. RESULTS: A majority (n = 57; 52.3%) of the 109 patients were female with hepatitis C virus genotype 3. Among these, 100 (91.7%) patients were non-responders and 9 (8.3%) were relapsers. The mean age of the patients was 38.9 +/- 8.8 years. The non-responders had elevated levels of serum aminotransferase. According to Batts-Ludwig classification, Grade 0 inflammation was not present in the non-responders and relapsers; grade 1 in 51 (46.8%); grade 2 in 47 (43.1%); grade 3 in 10 (9.2%); and grade 4 in 1(0.9%). Stage 0 fibrosis was present in 10 (9.2%); stage 1 in 34 (31.2%); stage 2 in 36 (33.0%); stage 3 in 13 (11.9%); and stage 4 in 16 (14.7%). CONCLUSION: Results suggested that even if it failed to eradicate hepatitis C virus, the conventional interferon and ribavirin therapy was able to halt the progress of necroinflammation and fibrosis.

19067471|t|Efficacy and tolerability of olmesartan medoxomil combined with amlodipine in patients with moderate to severe hypertension after amlodipine monotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study.
19067471|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebrovascular and cardiac adverse events can be significantly reduced by effective antihypertensive therapy; however, BP control rates remain poor. The objective of this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study was to determine the efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine combination therapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension who had failed to respond to treatment with 8 weeks of open-label amlodipine. METHODS: A total of 1017 patients entered the open-label amlodipine monotherapy stage; mean BP at week 0 was 164/102 mmHg. After 8 weeks of amlodipine monotherapy (5 mg/day), non-responding patients (n = 755) were randomized to receive placebo plus amlodipine 5 mg or a combination of olmesartan medoxomil (10-40 mg) with amlodipine 5 mg for 8 weeks. At week 16, patients who had achieved diastolic BP (DBP) <90 mmHg and/or systolic BP (SBP) <140 mmHg continued on randomized treatment for a further 8 weeks. Patients in whom both SBP and DBP were >or=140/90 mmHg at week 16 had their medication uptitrated to olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20/5 mg, olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/5 mg or olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/10 mg. RESULTS: Combination of olmesartan medoxomil (10-40 mg) with amlodipine 5 mg for 8 weeks (double-blind) reduced mean SBP/DBP by up to 16.8 mmHg and 9.6 mmHg, respectively. The additional adjusted mean change in seated DBP (SeDBP) [primary endpoint] with last observation carried forward (LOCF) compared with placebo/amlodipine 5 mg was -2.0 mmHg (p = 0.0207), -3.7 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and -3.8 mmHg (p < 0.0001) for olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 10/5 mg, 20/5 mg and 40/5 mg, respectively. The corresponding additional adjusted mean change in SeSBP compared with placebo/amlodipine 5 mg was -3.5 mmHg (p = 0.0103), -5.8 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and -7.1 mmHg (p < 0.0001) for the olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 10/5 mg, 20/5 mg and 40/5 mg groups, respectively. Uptitration was associated with further mean reductions of up to 12.6 mmHg (SeSBP) and 8.2 mmHg (SeDBP), and allowed additional patients to achieve goal BP. Target BP was defined using both SBP and DBP criteria (patients without diabetes <140/90 mmHg; patients with diabetes <130/80 mmHg). More than 70% of patients on active combination therapy achieved their BP goal by week 24. All combination regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that olmesartan medoxomil combined with amlodipine is effective and well tolerated in reducing BP in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.

1784994|t|Localized prostate carcinoma treated with TUR and neodymium-YAG laser irradiation.
1784994|a|Neodymium-YAG laser irradiation subsequent to extended transurethral resection has been practised in our department since 1981 as an alternative treatment for patients with localized prostate carcinoma. The treatment is performed endoscopically in two separate steps. The procedure is simple and complications are few. One hundred and twenty-four patients have been treated and followed up for more than 6 months. One hundred and ten patients are evaluated as disease free survivors and the overall actuarial disease free survival rate is 88% at 4-9 years of follow-up. The initial promising results persist and the results from other clinics confirm the method to be a fair alternative or patients with localized prostate carcinoma.

1667243|t|Retinoids inhibit the respiratory burst and degranulation of stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
1667243|a|Retinoids exhibit a wide spectrum of activities, including antiinflammatory properties. We have investigated the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and retinyl acetate (RAc) on the production of reactive oxygen metabolites and the release of lysosomal enzymes by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Incubation of PMN with RAc or RA (1-100 microM) caused a dose-dependent inhibition (upto 90%) in O2- production and chemiluminescence induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylanaline (fMLP), opsonized zymosan or ionophore A23187. Both retinoids (1-100 microM) also inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, degranulation induced by fMLP (upto 85% at the highest concentration of RA). These inhibitory effects appear irreversible, since they persist after the drugs are removed and the cells washed before stimulation. Inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase activity such as acetylsalicyclic acid and indomethacin did not influence the effects of RAc. In contrast, BW755, an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, reversed the inhibitory action of RAc, suggesting that the effect of retinoids occurs possibly through the mediation of lipoxygenase products. The modulation of PMN oxidative metabolism and degranulation might help explain the antiinflammatory properties of retinoids.

15693702|t|Inhibition of platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced aggregation of human thrombocytes by ginkgolides: considerations on possible bleeding complications after oral intake of Ginkgo biloba extracts.
15693702|a|The special Ginkgo biloba leaf extract EGb 761 is marketed for more then two decades. During this time its therapeutic efficacy and favorable safety profile have been proven in numerous clinical trails as well as by postmarketing surveillance in accordance with German drug regulations. During recent years, however, several cases of hemorrhage have been reported to occur in coincidence with the use of Ginkgo products. Although a clear causality between Ginkgo intake and bleeding could not be established, these observations have generally been explained by the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-antagonistic action of ginkgolides, which represent characteristic constituents of Ginkgo extracts. PAF was originally characterized by inducing aggregation and secretion of serotonin and histamine from rabbit platelets. We now confirmed that induction of aggregation of human platelets by PAF requires at least 200 times higher concentration when compared to rabbit cells. Under the chosen experimental conditions, PAF-mediated aggregation of human platelets was half-maximally inhibited by ginkgolide B, A, C and J at concentrations of 2.5, 15.8, 29.8 and 43.5 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations are generally more than 100 times higher as the peak plasma values measured after oral intake of EGb 761 at recommended doses between 120 and 240 mg. As PAF is a 'weak' platelet activator, which does not appear to be of importance for primary hemostasis, our results rise serious doubts that the PAF antagonistic effect of ginkgolides could be responsible for hemorrhage in patients taking EGb 761.

25267759|t|Multi-institutional study of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide as single-agent graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using myeloablative busulfan and fludarabine conditioning.
25267759|a|PURPOSE: The clinical safety and efficacy of intravenous busulfan and fludarabine (IV Bu/Flu) myeloablative conditioning as well as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) have been demonstrated independently in several single-institutional studies. We hypothesized that combining these two promising approaches in a multi-institutional study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched bone marrow transplantation would provide low rates of severe acute and chronic GVHD, low toxicity, and effective disease control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two adult patients (median age, 49 years; range, 21 to 65 years) with high-risk hematologic malignancies were enrolled at three centers (clinical trial No. NCT00809276). Forty-five patients received related allografts, and 47 received unrelated allografts. GVHD prophylaxis was solely with PTCy at 50 mg/kg/day on post-transplantation days +3 and +4. RESULTS: The cumulative incidences of grades 2 to 4 acute, grades 3 to 4 acute, and chronic GVHD were 51%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 1 year were 9% and 16%, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 2.2 years, the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 62% and 67%, respectively. Donor relatedness did not affect NRM, DFS, or OS. Patients in complete remission (CR) without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) had markedly better DFS (80%) and OS (80%) than patients in CR with MRD or with active disease at the time of transplantation (DFS, P = .0005; OS, P = .019). CONCLUSION: This multi-institutional study demonstrates that PTCy can be safely and effectively combined with IV Bu/Flu myeloablative conditioning and confirms PTCy's efficacy as single-agent, short-course GVHD prophylaxis for both acute and chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation from HLA-matched donors.

21335988|t|Whole cow's milk in early life.
21335988|a|Cow's milk is a major food for young children. Whole cow's milk is known to be detrimental to infants, mainly due to its low iron content. The negative association with iron status led to recommending the introduction of formula feeding in infancy during the weaning period or when breastfeeding ceased. More recently, the literature suggests that consuming whole cow's milk in infancy has unfortunate effects on growth, especially weight acceleration and development of overweight in childhood. These issues are discussed in the following chapter. Other suggested reasons for the avoidance of whole cow's milk in infancy are touched upon, such as milk protein allergy and high renal solute load. The hypothesis about early cow's milk introduction in the pathology of certain diseases, mainly through the peptide b-casomorphin-7, is briefly reviewed, showing that there is no clear evidence for the suggested associations. The chapter gives a recent example of introducing formula at 6 months of age instead of whole cow's milk in infants' diet in Iceland. Several aspects of consuming whole cow's milk in infancy can be found in recent reviews.

12391198|t|The role of the Ets2 transcription factor in the proliferation, maturation, and survival of mouse thymocytes.
12391198|a|In this study, we investigated the effects of Ets2 expression on the proliferation, maturation, and survival of thymocytes by establishing transgenic mice that specifically express Ets2 or a dominant negative form of Ets2, Deltaets2, in the thymus. We show that, in young animals, there are fewer T cells in Deltaets2 transgenic thymi and that the maturation of these T cells is affected at the CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative to CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive transition compared with wild-type littermate mice. Partial recovery in the number of thymocytes and full T cell maturation are restored with increasing age of Deltaets2 transgenic animals. However, thymocytes from adult Deltaets2 transgenic mice cultured ex vivo are more sensitive to cell death and to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis than are T cells from control littermate mice. We also show that T cells from adult ets2 transgenic mice proliferate faster than their wild-type littermates. The proliferation and survival of these T cells are clearly affected upon apoptotic signals: glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis induces T cells from ets2 transgenic mice to continue to proliferate in vivo and to survive better ex vivo than T cells from control littermates. It has been shown that c-Myc expression is required for thymic proliferation and improves thymocyte survival of dexamethasone-treated animals. We show that the expression of c-Myc, an Ets2 target, is elevated in T cells freshly isolated from thymi of ets2 transgenic mice pretreated with dexamethasone. Together, these results show that Ets2 plays a role in the proliferation and survival of thymocytes, implicating a Myc-dependent pathway.

17805036|t|BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis in pediatric cancer patients receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide.
17805036|a|Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a known complication of oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. BK virus (BKV) has been commonly found to be associated with hematuria in stem cell transplant patients; however, it has rarely been reported after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone. The authors present 3 cases of BK viruria with HC in nontransplant pediatric oncology patients. The 3 patients with BKV had more prolonged hematuria (14 to 16 wk) compared with 1 patient with BKV-negative HC (10 wk). The HC necessitated chemotherapy delays and also prolonged supportive care. One patient was treated with intravenous cidofovir with resolution of BK viruria and hematuria. BKV may have an association with the development of HC in nonstem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose oxazophosphorine chemotherapy. HC may present early and be more prolonged in patients with BK viruria. Patients with HC after cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with negative bacterial cultures should be studied for BKV. Cidofovir may be beneficial in certain patients with BK viruria and HC; however, definitive data will require a clinical trial.

7993413|t|Elevation of systemic oxygen delivery in the treatment of critically ill patients.
7993413|a|BACKGROUND: Elevation of systemic oxygen delivery and consumption has been associated with an improved outcome in critically ill patients. We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether boosting oxygen delivery by infusing the inotropic agent dobutamine would improve the outcome in a diverse group of such patients. METHODS: On the basis of previously published recommendations, we established the following goals: a cardiac index above 4.5 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area, oxygen delivery above 600 ml per minute per square meter, and oxygen consumption above 170 ml per minute per square meter. If these goals were not achieved with volume expansion alone, patients were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. The treatment group received intravenous dobutamine (5 to 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute) until all three goals had been achieved. Dobutamine was administered to the control group only if the cardiac index was below 2.8 liters per minute per square meter. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were studied. In nine patients the therapeutic goals were achieved with volume expansion alone; all nine patients survived to leave the hospital. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group, and 50 to the control group. During treatment, there were no differences between the two groups in mean arterial pressure or oxygen consumption, despite a significantly higher cardiac index and level of oxygen delivery in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Although the predicted risk of death during hospitalization was 34 percent for both groups, the in-hospital mortality was lower in the control group (34 percent) than in the treatment group (54 percent) (P = 0.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 39.1 percent). CONCLUSIONS: The use of dobutamine to boost the cardiac index and systemic oxygen delivery failed to improve the outcome in this heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. Contrary to what might have been expected, our results suggest that in some cases aggressive efforts to increase oxygen consumption may have been detrimental.

1874208|t|Effects and arterial concentration of prostaglandin E1 during cardiopulmonary bypass.
1874208|a|The effects an infusion prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on both haemodynamics and PGE1 arterial blood concentration during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied in 15 patients (eight patients received PGE1 30 ng kg-1 min-1; seven served as controls and did not receive PGE1 administration). Mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were significantly lower in the PGE1 group than in the control group during CPB. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to mean pulmonary-artery pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac or perfusion index. The arterial blood concentration of PGE1 in the control group during CPB was about 50 pg ml-1. In the PGE1 group it increased rapidly after the beginning of CPB and reached a level of 1500 pg ml-1 at 60 min of CPB. After weaning off CPB, PGE1 concentration decreased rapidly to 70 pg ml-1 in spite of the continuous PGE1 infusion. It is concluded that the metabolism of PGE1 is strongly inhibited during CPB and the effects of PGE1 may be unexpectedly heightened. Therefore, the infusion rate of PGE1 during CPB should be 30 ng kg-1 min-1 or less in order to avoid severe hypotension.

7516978|t|Safety, side effects and patient acceptance of the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist leuprolide in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
7516978|a|The luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist leuprolide was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comprising 50 evaluable patients with moderate to severe symptoms resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia. Patients received 3.75 mg. leuprolide depot or placebo as an injection every 28 days for 24 weeks. Hemoglobin level decreased by 0.8 gm/100 ml. (p = 0.0052) for patients receiving leuprolide. Mean testicular volume decreased by 28.9% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo. Of 26 patients receiving leuprolide 5 had a weight gain of more than 3 kg. Almost all patients receiving leuprolide experienced hot flushes. Breast changes, and loss of energy and vigor were not more pronounced than for patients receiving placebo. Erectile function and sexual activity were lost during treatment. Libido also decreased but was still partially retained. Despite this, patients receiving leuprolide were generally contented with their sexual life during treatment. Side effects were bothersome for some patients but were reversible. Of the patients in our study 73% expressed that they could repeat or continue treatment if that had been possible. The high cost of these drugs will limit their use for a benign condition, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia.

2306747|t|Lack of cardiovascular side effects of the new tricyclic antidepressant tianeptine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in young healthy volunteers.
2306747|a|In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, the effects of therapeutic doses of the new tricyclic antidepressant tianeptine on cardiovascular function were closely monitored in 21 healthy volunteers during a 2-week treatment period. Blood pressure measurements, ECG recording, 24-h Holter monitoring, and echocardiography were carried out at 1-week intervals. Isotopic ventriculography was measured twice under each treatment. Tianeptine did not produce orthostatic hypotension or increase heart rate. No ECG changes could be observed and the cardiac conduction time remained unchanged. One subject presented with an increase in frequency of ventricular premature beats that could not be definitely attributed to the drug. Cardiac output assessed at rest and after a bicycle exercise stress test was not altered. The present study suggests that tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant endowed with less cardiac toxicity than classical tricyclic antidepressants.

16217983|t|Insulin resistance in polycystic ovarian disease.
16217983|a|The classic polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was originally described by Stein and Leventhal as the association of amenorrhea with polycystic ovaries and, variably, hirsutism and/or obesity. It is estimated that 5 to 10% of women of reproductive age have PCOS. Although insulin resistance is not part of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS, its importance in the pathogenesis of PCOS can not be denied. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, independent of total or fat-free body mass. Postreceptor defects in the action of insulin have been described in PCOS that are similar to those found in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Treatment with insulin sensitizers, metformin, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve both metabolic and hormonal patterns and also improve ovulation in PCOS. Recent studies have shown that women who have PCOS have higher circulating levels of inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). It is possible that the beneficial effect of insulin sensitizers in PCOS may be partly due to a decrease in inflammation.

21720768|t|Expression of b1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases during differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia cells.
21720768|a|The expressions of b1,3-N-acetylglucosamonyltransferase-2 and -8 (b3GnT-2, b3GnT-8),-the two main glycosyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) in glycans, and b3GnT-5 participating in the syntheses of sphingoglycolipids were studied in leukemia cell lines during differentiation using RT-PCR method. b3GnT-2 and b3GnT-8 distribute widely in six myeloid and monocytoid leukemia cell lines with different abundances, while b3GnT-4 was only present in NB4 cells. ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which induce the differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 (two human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines) to myelocytic lineage, up-regulated these two enzymes with various degrees at 2 and 72 h of treatment. In HL-60 cells treated with ATRA, the increase of b3GnT-8 was more than b3GnT-2, while in NB4 cells treated with DMSO, the increase of b3GnT-2 was more than b3GnT-8. However, when HL-60 and NB4 were differentiated to monocytic lineage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the expressions of b3GnT-2 and b3GnT-8 showed no alterations or the increase of expressions was far less than those in myelocytic differentiation. By means of FITC-labeled tomato lectin affinity staining and flow-cytometry, it was found that the product of b3GnT-2 and -8, polyLacNAc was also increased on the cell surface of HL-60 and NB4 treated with ATRA or DMSO, but unchanged when treated with PMA. These results were in accordance with the up-regulation of the mRNAs of b3GnT-2 and -8. The expression of b3GnT-5, however, was not changed both in myelocytic and monocytic differentiations. The difference in the up-regulation of b3GnT-2 and -8, especially their products may become a useful index to discriminate the myelocytic and monocytic differentiation of leukemia cells.

19818996|t|Value of serum CA125 levels in patients with high-risk, early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
19818996|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to ascertain whether serum CA125 level is predictive of disease progression in patients with high-risk, early stage (stage IA/B grade 3, stage IC any grade, stage I clear cell, or stage II) epithelial ovarian cancer who have achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. METHODS: Between January 1998 and April 2004, we reviewed the records of 95 patients with high-risk, early stage epithelial ovarian cancer who had elevated CA125 levels at the time of diagnosis and were complete responders after 6 cycles of adjuvant paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the most useful CA125 level in predicting disease progression and Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for covariates were used for analyses. RESULTS: The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 70.5%. The optimal cutoff point of CA125 after completing adjuvant chemotherapy to predict disease progression was 12 U/mL (sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 82.1%). On multivariate analysis, CA125 level>12 U/mL after completing adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor predictive for disease progression. The risk of recurrence was higher for CA125 level>12 U/mL (hazards ratio=10.567; P<0.001). The 5-year PFS rate for patients with CA125 level< or =12 U/mL was 83.3%, which was higher than a PFS of 37.5% for CA125>12 U/mL (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CA125 level after 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy is a strong independent prognostic factor for high-risk, early stage epithelial ovarian cancer after achieving a complete response.

9165488|t|Acrylamide and carbon disulfide treatments increase the rate of rat brain tubulin polymerization.
9165488|a|Acrylamide and carbon disulfide produce central-peripheral distal axonopathy in experimental animals and humans. The main feature of this disease is the focal swellings containing neurofilaments in distal axons, followed by nerve degeneration beyond these swellings. We studied the possible role of tubulin assembly kinetics in this disease. The rats were either administered acrylamide (50 mg/kg, ip, saline) or exposed to carbon disulfide (700 ppm, 9 h) via inhalation for 12 and 15 d, respectively. Tubulin, purified from both acrylamide-(10.37 +/- 0.3 vs 11.3 +/- 0.15) and carbon disulfide-treated (9.72 +/- 0.5 vs 11.18 +/- 0.25) rat brains showed increase in Vmax (OD/min x 10(3)) of its polymerization. However, only acrylamide treatment showed a decrease in time to Vmax, when brain supernatant was used for tubulin polymerization. In vitro addition of acrylamide (0.1-1 mM) to bovine brain tubulin also showed a decrease in time to Vmax (16-21%) of its polymerization. Carbon disulfide treatment of rats, on the other hand, showed a decrease in MAP-2 and an increase in a 120-kDa peptide concentration. The latter showed immunoreactivity with anti-MAP-2. The increase in the rate of tubulin polymerization by acrylamide and carbon disulfide treatment may alter the rate of transport of axonal constituents, including neurofilament, and contribute toward their accumulation in the focal swellings observed in this neuropathy.

9009112|t|Effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide and atropine on human colonic motility, tone, and transit.
9009112|a|The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in postprandial control of colonic motility is controversial. To test the hypothesis that CCK stimulates colonic tone, motility, and transit we measured these colonic functions in 16 healthy subjects using intraluminal manometry, barostatic balloon measurements, and radioscintigraphy. This was a randomized-order, double-blind, sequential study design in each subject of saline and either atropine (0.01 mg/kg stat and 0.01 mg/kg/hr by infusion) or CCK-octapeptide (OP, 30 ng/kg stat and 60 ng/kg/hr by infusion). Atropine was used as control to demonstrate responsiveness of selected parameters of colonic motility. Atropine significantly reduced whole colon (change from fasting = 52 +/- 11%) and left colon (change from fasting 61 +/- 8%) phasic pressure activity and transverse colon tone (change from fasting 159 +/- 40%); CCK-OP had no significant effects on phasic contractility, tone or transit. Thus, a CCK-OP infusion that maximally stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion and gallbladder contraction has no effect on motor function or transit in prepared colon of healthy subjects.

18987459|t|Improvement in medication compliance and glycemic control with voglibose oral disintegrating tablet.
18987459|a|Good compliance with hypoglycemic therapy is important for diabetes treatment, since positive relationship between medication compliance and glycemic control has been reported. To improve medication compliance, the oral disintegrating tablet technology that facilitates drug administration without water has been employed in various drugs, including voglibose, an alpha glucosidase inhibitor. In the present survey, we investigated safety profile of voglibose oral disintegrating tablet (VODT), and whether treatment with VODT results in improvement of medication compliance and glycemic control. Patients with diabetes received VODT 0.6 or 0.9 mg/day for 12 weeks. Among 2,930 eligible patients, adverse drug reactions were observed in 3.6%, with the most common being abdominal distension, flatulence, diarrhea, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. In 1,067 patients who received conventional voglibose tablet (CVT) prior to VODT, 53.1% reported that taking VODT was easier than taking CVT. Medication compliance was improved after switching to VODT in 28.4% of patients who missed taking tablets more than one time a week during CVT treatment. A significant decrease in HbA(1C) levels was observed in patients whose medication compliance was improved after switching to VODT (P = 0.033), but there was no significant reduction in HbA(1C) levels in patients whose medication compliance did not change. In conclusion, the present survey suggests that the safety profile of VODT is comparable with that of CVT, and switching from CVT to VODT has positive impact on medication compliance which may lead to an improvement in glycemic control.

21697298|t|Diet, environmental factors, and lifestyle underlie the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in healthy adults in Scotland, and supplementation reduces the proportion that are severely deficient.
21697298|a|Vitamin D deficiency has recently been implicated as a possible risk factor in the etiology of numerous diseases, including nonskeletal conditions. In humans, skin synthesis following exposure to UVB is a potent source of vitamin D, but in regions with low UVB, individuals are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and to investigate determinants of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations in a high northern latitude country. Detailed dietary, lifestyle, and demographic data were collected for 2235 healthy adults (21-82 y) from Scotland. Plasma 25-OHD was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Among study participants, 34.5% were severely deficient (25-OHD <25 nmol/L) and 28.9% were at high risk of deficiency (25-40 nmol/L). Only 36.6% of participants were at low risk of vitamin D deficiency or had adequate levels (>40 nmol/L). Among participants who were taking supplements, 21.3% had a May-standardized 25-OHD concentration >50 nmol/L, 54.2% had 25-50 nmol/L, and 24.5% had <25 nmol/L, whereas this was 15.6, 43.3, and 41%, respectively, among those who did not take supplements (P < 0.0001). The most important sources of vitamin D were supplements and fish consumption. Vitamin D deficiency in Scotland is highly prevalent due to a combination of insufficient exposure to UVB and insufficient dietary intake. Higher dietary vitamin D intake modestly improved the plasma 25-OHD concentration (P = 0.02) and reduced the proportion of severely deficient individuals (P < 0.0001). In regions with low UVB exposure, dietary and supplement intake may be much more important than previously thought and consideration should be given to increasing the current recommended dietary allowance of 0-10 µg/d for adults in Scotland.

19485979|t|Endoscopic band ligation could decrease recurrent bleeding in Mallory-Weiss syndrome as compared to haemostasis by hemoclips plus epinephrine.
19485979|a|BACKGROUND: Mallory-Weiss syndrome (MWS) with active bleeding at endoscopy may require endoscopic haemostasis the modalities of which are not well-defined. AIM: To compare the efficacy of endoscopic band ligation vs. hemoclip plus epinephrine (adrenaline) in bleeding MWS. METHODS: From 2001 to 2008, 218 consecutive patients with a MWS at endoscopy were hospitalized in our Gastrointestinal Bleeding Unit. In 56 patients (26%), an endoscopic haemostasis was required because of active bleeding. Band ligation was performed in 29 patients (Banding group), while hemoclip application plus epinephrine injection was performed in 27 patients (H&E group). Treatment efficacy and early recurrent bleeding were retrospectively compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Primary endoscopic haemostasis was achieved in all patients. Recurrent bleeding occurred in 0% in Banding group vs. 18% in H&E group (P = 0.02). The use of hemoclips plus epinephrine (OR = 3; 95% CI = 1.15-15.8) and active bleeding at endoscopy (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.04-5.2) were independent predictive factors of early recurrent bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Haemostasis by hemoclips plus epinephrine was an independent predictive factor of rebleeding. This result suggests that band ligation could be the first choice endoscopic treatment for bleeding MWS, but requires further prospective assessment.

16230742|t|ADRP/adipophilin is degraded through the proteasome-dependent pathway during regression of lipid-storing cells.
16230742|a|Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a major protein associated with lipid droplets in various types of cells, including macrophage-derived foam cells and liver cells. However, the role of ADRP in the processes of formation and regression of these cells is not understood. When J774 murine macrophages were incubated with either VLDL or oleic acid, their content of both ADRP and triacylglycerol (TG) increased 3- to 4-fold. Induction of ADRP during TG accumulation was also observed in oleic acid-treated HuH-7 human liver cells. Addition of triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, for 6 h decreased the amount of TG in VLDL-induced foam cells and oleic acid-treated liver cells; it decreased the amount of ADRP protein in parallel, indicating the amount of ADRP reduced during regression of the lipid-storing cells. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor during triacsin C treatment abolished the ADRP decrease and accumulated polyubiquitinated ADRP. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor reversed not only the degradation of ADRP but also TG reduction by triacsin C. These results suggest that cellular amounts of ADRP and TG regulate each other and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in degradation of ADRP during regression of lipid-storing cells.

2196924|a|In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of PTT-119, a new tripeptide which is known to be a bifunctional alkylating agent, on two tumor cell lines with different origins: SK-DHL-2 (B-cell diffuse histiocytic lymphoma cell line) and RPMI 8226 (Multiple myeloma patient cell line) and compared the toxicity of PTT-119 toward normal human bone marrow granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and pluripotent (CFU-GEM) progenitors. Reduction of at least four logs was achieved on clonogenic myeloma cells after 1 hr of treatment with 25 micrograms/mL of PTT-119 either in the presence or absence of irradiated bone marrow (BM) cells. More than three and at least four logs of lymphoma cell kill were found after 1 hr of incubation with 25 and 40 micrograms/mL of the tripeptide, respectively. PTT-119 antitumor effects on SK-DHL-2 were only slightly affected in the presence of an excess of BM cells. BM cells treated for 1 hr with 25 micrograms/mL of PTT-119 showed a mean recovery of 4.5, 3.8, and 13.8% of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM, respectively. The addition of 5- and 10-fold excesses of red blood cells (RBC) produced a slightly higher recovery of these hematopoietic progenitors. These results suggest that PTT-119 may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent for the ex vivo treatment of bone marrow grafts.

8030848|t|Antagonic-stress. A new treatment in gerontopsychiatry and for a healthy productive life.
8030848|a|A complex antiaging formula--Antagonic-Stress--was investigated vs. placebo (PL), meclofenoxate (MF)--neurometabolic nootropic and vs. nicergoline (NE)--cerebral vasodilator by comparative multiple trials (double-blind, randomized, and parallel) in gerontopsychiatry (DSM-III-R, 1987 and ICD-10, 1992 criteria). AS vs. PL studies in organic mental disorders--amnestic, depressive, anxiety, associated with axis III physical disorders or conditions, and in multiinfarct dementia were followed by AS vs. MF or NE investigations in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type. A total of 343 old people, distributed in 4 PL groups, 1 MF group, 1 NE group, and 5 AS groups were studied. Multiple investigations, before and after three-month treatments were made: psychometric evaluation by Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric, Self-Assessment Scale-Geriatric and their 5 subscales; psychopathological rating by Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales; as well as psychometric testing by digit symbol of WAIS, Wechsler Memory Scale and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Except PL, prolonged and large dose treatments with these cerebral activators (MF, NE and especially AS) reduced the psychogeriatric-psychopathological scores and the deterioration index, and improved cognitive performance. The therapeutical effectiveness of AS multiple formula in gerontopsychiatry and its superiority vs. monotherapy (MF or NE) are discussed in connection with its complex neurometabolic and synergetic composition, multiple antioxidative combinations, free radical scavengers, lipofuscinolytic agents, the antiischemic action of antioxidants, multivitamin and multimineral supplementation, and with the better efficacy of multitherapy vs. monotherapy in geriatrics.

1977006|t|Hypothesis: is lung disease after silicate inhalation caused by oxidant generation?
1977006|a|Inhaled silicate dusts may cause lung disease through their surface coordination of iron with subsequent oxidant generation via the Fenton reaction. Pneumoconiosis, irritant bronchitis, focal emphysema, and carcinoma may be produced by oxidants either directly through lipid peroxidation and protein inactivation, or indirectly by oxidant-mediated release of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor. The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor.

12562049|t|Future directions in the treatment and prevention of bone metastases.
12562049|a|Preclinical studies are providing a growing body of evidence that bisphosphonates, particularly nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, have antitumor activity. Bisphosphonates induce tumor cell apoptosis and reduce skeletal tumor burden in tumor xenograft models. Clinical studies with daily oral clodronate suggest that bisphosphonates can prevent bone metastases when used in the adjuvant setting, but the effect on overall survival is less certain. The more potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, i.e., pamidronate and zoledronic acid, have demonstrated antitumor activity at approximately 10- to 100-fold lower concentrations than clodronate in vitro. A number of important unanswered questions must be addressed regarding the optimal use of bisphosphonates for prevention of bone metastases. For example, when should treatment begin, how long must treatment be continued, and what are the optimal dose and schedule to achieve clinically meaningful antitumor effects? Adjuvant studies of zoledronic acid in patients with breast and prostate cancer are under development, and the results are eagerly anticipated.

2389747|t|Diet and the risk of pancreatic cancer in men.
2389747|a|To examine the relation between diet and pancreatic cancer, we conducted a population-based case-control study in western Washington. Cases (n = 148) were married men, aged 20-74 years, who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from July 1982 to June 1986. Controls (n = 188), identified by random digit dialing, were frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age groups. Wives responded as surrogates for both cases and controls. Wives were interviewed by telephone, and they completed a mailed, self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Results indicated that pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing protein intake. The increased risk for heavy consumers of protein was largely confined to individuals aged 65 years and above. In that group, the odds ratio for those in the highest quartile of protein intake, relative to the lowest, was 6.0 (95% confidence interval 1.7-20.6). No association was found between pancreatic cancer risk and the intake of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, or vitamins A and C. There was an unexpected inverse association between calcium intake and pancreatic cancer risk in these data. These findings are discussed in relation to possible etiologic mechanisms that they suggest.

8182216|t|The lymphocyte transformation test with sulphadiminidum and with prealbumin-sulphadiminidum complex in patients with drug allergy.
8182216|a|Earlier results (the absence or a decreased level of prealbumin [PA] in the serum, a higher proportion of PA-bearing lymphocytes as antigen-binding cells, and the presence of PA in the eluate of lymphocytes in patients with drug allergy) permitted the conclusion that, besides its other relevant functions, PA may also behave as a hapten carrier protein. The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) involving measurement of 3H-thymidine uptake was therefore carried out with sulphadiminidum (SA) alone, with the PA-SA complex, and with the albumin-SA complex in patients with proven (3 cases) or suspected (63 cases) sensitivity to SA. In all 3 cases with proven drug allergy to SA and in 5 of the 63 suspect cases, the LTT was positive in response to both the drug alone and to the PA-SA complex (The albumin-SA complex gave positivity in only one case). In 5 of the 63 suspect cases, the LTT was positive only in response to the PA-SA complex. It is suggested that the sensitivity of the LTT could be increased if the test could be run with a complex of a protein (hapten carrier?) and a drug.

24565837|t|Saikosaponin C inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis by suppressing caspase-3 activation and subsequent degradation of focal adhesion kinase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
24565837|a|Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important mediator of inflammation and a potent inducer of endothelial cell damage and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of saikosaponin C (SSc), one of the active ingredients produced by the traditional Chinese herb, Radix Bupleuri, against LPS-induced apoptosis in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). LPS triggered caspase-3 activation, which was found to be important in LPS-induced HUVEC apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-3 also inhibited LPS-induced degradation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), indicating that caspase-3 is important in LPS-mediated FAK degradation as well as in apoptosis in HUVECs. SSc significantly inhibited LPS-induced apoptotic cell death in HUVECs through the selective suppression of caspase-3. SSc was also shown to rescue LPS-induced FAK degradation and other cell adhesion signals. Furthermore, the protective effects of SSc against LPS-induced apoptosis were abolished upon pretreatment with a FAK inhibitor, highlighting the importance of FAK in SSc activity. Taken together, these results show that SSc efficiently inhibited LPS-induced apoptotic cell death via inhibition of caspase-3 activation and caspase-3-mediated-FAK degradation. Therefore, SSc represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of vascular endothelial cell injury and cellular dysfunction.

12370400|t|TGF-beta and IL-13 synergistically increase eotaxin-1 production in human airway fibroblasts.
12370400|a|Chronic diseases may involve an "innate" response followed by an adaptive immune response, of a Th1 or Th2 variety. Little is known regarding the interactions of these responses. We hypothesized that TGF-beta1 (innate response factor associated with wound repair) in combination with IL-13 (Th2 factor) might augment inflammatory processes associated with asthma. Airway fibroblasts were cultured from asthmatic subjects and normal controls. These fibroblasts were exposed to TGF-beta1 and IL-13 alone or in combination, and eotaxin-1 expression and production were evaluated. At 48 h, eotaxin-1 production was markedly increased with the combination of TGF-beta1 and IL-13 (p < 0.0001) compared with either stimulus alone. mRNA increased slightly at 1 h with IL-13 or TGF-beta1 plus IL13, peaked, and became significantly increased over IL-13 alone at 24 h. Protein was measurable from 6 h with IL-13 and TGF-beta1 plus IL-13, but greater levels were measured over time with the combination. Actinomycin ablated the increase in mRNA and protein seen with IL-13 alone and with TGF-beta1 plus IL-13. Cycloheximide blocked the increase in mRNA at 6 h in both conditions, but also blocked the increase at 24 h with TGF-beta1 plus IL-13. STAT-6 was rapidly activated with both IL-13 and the combination, without difference. Finally, eotaxin-1-positive fibroblasts were identified in severe asthma biopsies in greater numbers than in normals. These results support the concept that interactions of innate and adaptive immune systems may be important in promoting the tissue eosinophilia of asthma, particularly in those with more severe disease.

8768828|t|Effects of a 7-day treatment with a novel, orally active, growth hormone (GH) secretagogue, MK-677, on 24-hour GH profiles, insulin-like growth factor I, and adrenocortical function in normal young men.
8768828|a|To assess the effects of prolonged administration of a novel analog of GH-releasing peptide (MK-677), nine healthy young men participated in a randomized, double blind, three-period cross-over comparison of orally administered placebo and 5- and 25-mg doses of MK-677. Each period involved bedtime administration of the drug for 7 consecutive days. At the end of each period, plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were measured at 0745 h, and 24-h profiles of plasma GH and cortisol were obtained at 15-min intervals together with the 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol. Profiles of plasma free cortisol were calculated at hourly intervals. The amounts of GH secreted were similar in all three conditions, but GH pulse frequency was increased with both dosages of the drug, primarily because of an increase in the number of low amplitude pulses. Plasma IGF-I levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas IGFBP-3 levels were increased only with the highest dosage. There was a positive relationship between GH pulse frequency and IGF-I increase. Except for an advance in the nocturnal nadir and in the morning elevation, MK-677 had no effect on cortisol profiles. In particular, 24-h mean levels of plasma total and free cortisol and urinary excretion of free cortisol were similar under all conditions. The present data suggest that the use of MK-677 for the treatment of relative somatotropic deficiency, particularly in older adults compromised by such deficiency, deserves further investigation.

19135138|t|Decaarginine-PEG-liposome enhanced transfection efficiency and function of arginine length and PEG.
19135138|a|Oligoarginine-conjugated lipids ((Arg)n-PEG-lipid) (n=4, 6, 8, and 10: number of arginine residues) are novel gene delivery vectors. We prepared two oligoarginine-modified liposomes using (Arg)n-lipid without and with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer ((Arg)n-L and (Arg)n-PEG-L), and investigated the effect of PEG spacer and oligoarginine length of liposomes on cellular uptake, gene transfection, and its mechanism in HeLa cells, using complexes with plasmid DNA (DNA) or oligodeoxynucleotide. Transfection efficiency increased as the number of arginine residues increased and Arg10-PEG-L/DNA complexes (lipoplexes) showed the highest gene transfection efficiency among (Arg)n- and (Arg)n-PEG-lipoplexes. Arg4- and Arg4-PEG-lipoplexes were taken up greatly into cells, but showed lower transfection efficiency than Arg10- and Arg10-PEG-lipoplexes, respectively. The different gene expression by Arg4-L to Arg10-L with or without PEG spacer may be explained by the different intracellular uptake mechanism. The main cellular uptake mechanism of Arg10-L and Arg10-PEG-L was the macropinocytosis pathway, whereas that of Arg4-L and Arg4-PEG-L was not. PEG spacer was more effective for intracellular trafficking than Arg length and surface charge of lipoplex which depends on Arg length at the almost same size of lipoplexes. The findings suggested that Arg10-PEG-L was a superior vector since Arg10 induced the macropinocytosis uptake pathway.

10507745|t|Newer pharmacologic alternatives for erectile dysfunction.
10507745|a|With the introduction of effective pharmacologic therapies for erectile dysfunction, more men are seeking treatment. The underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is usually a chronic medical illness or a side effect of certain drugs. Less commonly, the problem is psychogenic. Even after optimal treatment of common medical disorders such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, erectile dysfunction may persist. Pharmacologic treatments, such as the intracavernosal or transurethral administration of alprostadil or the use of the new oral medication sildenafil, may offer patients substantial benefit. Before any of these drugs are prescribed, consideration should be given to existing medical illnesses and medications, partner satisfaction, comfort with the method of administration and the side effect profile.

17397100|t|Cardiovascular effects of high dose venlafaxine XL in patients with major depressive disorder.
17397100|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess cardiovascular safety profile of high dose Venlafaxine XL in patients with major depression. METHOD: Effects of high dose venlafaxine (mean 346.15 mg;) on the cardiovascular system in 37 patients with major depressive disorder were evaluated: BP, ECG (PR, QT, QRSD and QTc intervals) and heart rate. RESULTS: 12.5% of patients developed hypertension after starting treatment with venlafaxine. There was an association between heart rate and the dose of venlafaxine although not statistically significant. There was no association between dose of venlafaxine and PR, QT, QRSD and QTc intervals. One patient on 300 mg who was hypertensive and on other medications that may prolong QTc, had mildly prolonged QTc. However this was not clinically significant. CONCLUSION: This study of subjects on high dose venlafaxine (mean 346.15 mg; range 225-525 mg) did not demonstrate any clinical or statistically significant effects on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including PR, QT, QRSD and QTc interval.

9808489|t|Immunosuppressive effects and safety of a sirolimus/cyclosporine combination regimen for renal transplantation.
9808489|a|BACKGROUND: Sirolimus, a novel immunosuppressant that inhibits cytokine-driven cell proliferation and maturation, prolongs allograft survival in animal models. After a phase I trial in stable renal transplant recipients documented that cyclosporine and sirolimus have few overlapping toxicities, we conducted an open-label, single-center, phase I/II dose-escalation trial to examine the safety and efficacy of this drug combination. METHODS: Forty mismatched living-donor renal transplant recipients were sequentially assigned to receive escalating initial doses of sirolimus (0.5-7.0 mg/m2/day), in addition to courses of prednisone and a concentration-controlled regimen of cyclosporine. We conducted surveillance for drug-induced side effects among sirolimus-treated patients and compared their incidence of acute rejection episodes as well as mean laboratory values with those of a historical cohort of 65 consecutive, immediately precedent, demographically similar recipients treated with the same concentration-controlled regimen of cyclosporine and tapering doses of prednisone. RESULTS: The addition of sirolimus reduced the overall incidence of acute allograft rejection episodes to 7.5% from 32% in the immediately precedent cyclosporine/prednisone-treated patients. At 18- to 47-month follow-up periods, both treatment groups displayed similar rates of patient and graft survival, as well as morbid complications. Although sirolimus-treated patients displayed comparatively lower platelet and white blood cell counts and higher levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides, sirolimus did not augment the nephrotoxic or hypertensive proclivities of cyclosporine. The degree of change in the laboratory values was more directly associated with whole blood trough drug concentrations than with doses of sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus potentiates the immunosuppressive effects of a cyclosporine-based regimen by reducing the rate of acute rejection episodes.

9130331|t|Compliance with stimulant medications in patients with narcolepsy.
9130331|a|The goals of this descriptive study were to determine what percentage of our treated narcoleptic subjects took their stimulant medications as prescribed and to examine the relationship between compliance and response to stimulant medications. Data obtained from a screening questionnaire, sleep diaries, and medical records showed that 22 of our 43 treated narcoleptic subjects reduced their dosage of stimulant medications or had not taken any stimulant medications during a 24-hour monitoring period during which they were expected to be on medication. Although we had expected better compliance among subjects who responded to stimulant medications (day-wake subjects), statistical testing revealed no significant differences between the two groups. Nor were there any significant differences in age, gender, or educational level when compliant and noncompliant subjects were compared. Only the type of drug prescribed (short versus long-acting stimulant) affected compliance; 39.4% of the subjects with prescriptions for dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate took the amount of medication prescribed compared to 87.5% of the subjects with prescriptions for pemoline.

8262734|t|Polyethylene glycol conjugated interleukin-2: clinical and immunologic effects in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
8262734|a|Recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) modified with monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG IL-2) was utilized in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in two separate multi-institutional trials. PEG IL-2 was administered as an I.V. bolus days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with cycles repeated every six weeks. The two trials employed different dose levels: A) 20 x 10(6) I.U./m2 day 1 followed by 12 x 10(6) I.U./m2 days 8, 15, 22; and B) 12 x 10(6) I.U./m2 days 1, 8, 15, 22. Thirty-five patients were entered and 31 were evaluable for response (A-15/18, B-16/17). Two of 31 patients had partial responses. Median therapy duration was four weeks (range 1-15), and dose reduction for grade III or IV toxicity was required in 14/35 patients (A-6/18, B-8/17). Toxicity (> or = grade III) seen included: hypotension 51%, dyspnea 17%, seizures 6%, and mental status changes 11%. No differences in response or toxicity between the two schedules were noted. Hematologic changes included lymphocytosis and eosinophilia in the majority of patients. PEG IL-2 given once weekly has significant toxicity, and may produce tumor regression in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

14973114|t|Cyclooxygenase-2 is essential for HER2/neu to suppress N- (4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells.
14973114|a|We reported that HER2/neu reduces the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR) by suppressing nitric oxide production. We show that HER2/neu uses Akt to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and that inhibition of Akt or COX-2 increases 4-HPR-induced apoptosis and nitric oxide production. Apoptosis induced by the 4-HPR and COX-2 inhibitor combination, although unaffected by an anti-HER2/neu antibody, was reversed by the COX-2 product prostaglandin E(2), indicating that COX-2 is a major mechanism by which HER2/neu suppresses 4-HPR apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Combining 4-HPR with COX-2 inhibitors may be a novel chemopreventive strategy against HER2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors.

11406023|t|Antidepressant drug treatment for postnatal depression.
11406023|a|BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression is a common disorder, which can have profound short and long term effects on maternal morbidity, the new infant and the family as a whole. Social factors appear to be particularly important in the aetiology and prognosis of postnatal depression and treatment is often largely social support and psychological interventions. It is not known whether antidepressants are an effective and safe choice for treatment of this disorder. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressant drugs and compare their effectiveness with other forms of treatment. To assess any adverse effects of antidepressants in the mother or the nursing baby. SEARCH STRATEGY: The registers of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group were searched. Other databases (outlined below) were also searched and contacts were made with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials were considered in which women with depression in the first six months postpartum were randomised to receive antidepressants alone or in combination with another treatment, or to receive any other treatment including placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted independently from the trial reports by the reviewers. Missing information was requested from investigators wherever possible. Data was sought to allow an "intention to treat" analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Only one trial could be included in this review, leaving most of the objectives of the review unfulfilled. Appleby et al (1997) reported that Fluoxetine was significantly more effective than placebo and, after an initial session of counselling, as effective as a full course of cognitive-behavioural counselling in the treatment of postnatal depression. There was no interaction between medication and counselling. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Women with postnatal depression can be effectively treated with fluoxetine, which is as effective as a course of cognitive-behavioural counselling in the short-term. However, more trials with a longer follow-up period are needed to compare different antidepressants in the treatment of postnatal depression, and to compare antidepressant treatment with psychosocial interventions. This is an area that has been neglected despite the large public health impact described above.

2252128|t|Stunned myocardium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
2252128|a|The "stunned myocardium" is a syndrome of reversible myocardial dysfunction that may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. This phenomenon has been seen in some neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We performed echocardiograms and measured creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes and lipid peroxide levels in 16 neonates before, during, and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Infants who developed stunned myocardia by echocardiography did so shortly after initiation of bypass and exhibited concurrent elevations of the MB fraction of creatine phosphokinase. Lipid peroxide levels did not simultaneously rise. These data suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may not cause the stunned myocardium seen in neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

8252318|t|Additive effect of combined naproxen and paracetamol in rheumatoid arthritis.
8252318|a|The clinical effect and plasma naproxen levels were studied in 20 patients with RA receiving three doses of naproxen and two naproxen doses combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in a randomized, double-blind, comparison in five 2-wk treatment periods. A significant dose-concentration effect relationship was found for the three naproxen doses (500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily). The following variables were measured: global clinical effect, joint index, morning stiffness, activity of daily living (ADL), pain during movement and at rest. The naproxen dose-concentration effect relationship curve was moved to the left by the addition of 4 g paracetamol daily. No major side effects were observed, but complaints concerning the gastrointestinal tract were fewer on lower naproxen doses and these were not increased by concomitant paracetamol treatment. The results show that the clinical effect of naproxen in RA may be significantly increased by concomitant paracetamol administration.

17766838|t|A platelet biomarker for assessing phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition during cancer chemotherapy.
17766838|a|Thrombin cleavages of selective proteinase-activated receptors (PAR) as well as PAR-activating peptide ligands can initiate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade in platelets. Downstream to this event, fibrinogen receptors on platelets undergo conformational changes that enhance fibrinogen binding. In our study, we used this phenomenon as a surrogate biomarker for assessing effects on PI3K activity. Our method, using flow cytometric measurement of fluorescent ligand and antibody binding, uncovered a 16- to 45-fold signal window after PAR-induced platelet activation. Pretreatment (in vitro) with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition at predicted potencies. In addition, platelets taken from mice treated with wortmannin were blocked from PAR-induced ex vivo activation concomitantly with a decrease in phosphorylation of AKT from excised tumor xenografts. This surrogate biomarker assay was successfully tested (in vitro) on blood specimens received from volunteer cancer patients. Our results indicate that measurement of platelet activation could serve as an effective drug activity biomarker during clinical evaluation of putative PI3K inhibitors.

11738568|t|Synthesis of bis-spermine dimers that are potent polyamine transport inhibitors.
11738568|a|A series of novel spermine dimer analogues was synthesized and assessed for their ability to inhibit spermidine transport into MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Two spermine molecules were tethered via their N(1) primary amines with naphthalenedisulfonic acid, adamantanedicarboxylic acid and a series of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. The linked spermine analogues were potent polyamine transport inhibitors and inhibited cell growth cytostatically in combination with a polyamine synthesis inhibitor. Variation in the linker length did not alter polyamine transport inhibition. The amount of charge on the molecule may influence the molecular interaction with the transporter since the most potent spermidine transport inhibitors contained 5-6 positive charges.

11042673|t|CD40 ligand, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL spare group I Burkitt lymphoma cells from CD77-directed killing via Verotoxin-1 B chain but fail to protect against the holotoxin.
11042673|a|Owing to its lineage and differentiation stage-restricted expression, CD77 has been mooted as a therapeutic target in Burkitt lymphoma (BL). The recognition that the globotriaosyl moiety of this neutral glycosphingolipid is a receptor for Escherichia coli-derived Verotoxin-1 (Shiga-Like Toxin-1) offers a potential delivery system for the attack. Here we show that CD77-expressing Group I BL cells which are normally susceptible to activation-induced death on binding Verotoxin-1 B chain are protected in the presence of CD40 ligand. Ectopic expression of either bcl-2 or bcl-xL also afforded resistance to the actions of the B chain. In total contrast, neither of the survival genes nor a CD40 signal - even when acting in concert - protected against killing mediated by the holotoxin. These findings indicate that while therapeutic modalities for CD77-expressing B cell tumors (which include follicular lymphoma) based on the use of Verotoxin-1 B chain might be compromised by the activation of endogenous or exogenous survival pathways, those exploiting the holotoxin should be left unscathed.

19694722|t|Interleukin-4 distinctively modifies responses of germinal centre-like and activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas to immuno-chemotherapy.
19694722|a|Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) can be classified into two subtypes: germinal-centre B-cell (GCB)-like and Activated B-cell (ABC)-like tumours, which are associated with longer or shorter patient overall survival, respectively. In our previous studies, we have shown that, although DLBCL tumours of GCB-like and ABC-like subtypes express similar levels of IL4 mRNA, they exhibit distinct patterns of IL-4-induced intracellular signalling and different expression of IL-4 target genes. We hypothesized that these differences may contribute to the different clinical behaviour and outcome of DLBCL subtypes. Herein, we demonstrated that IL-4 increased the sensitivity of GCB-like DLBCL to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and complement-dependent rituximab cell killing. In contrast, IL-4 protected ABC-like DLBCL from the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and rituximab. The distinct effects of IL-4 on doxorubicin sensitivity in GCB-like and ABC-like DLBCL cells may be partially attributed to the contrasting effects of the cytokine on Bcl-2 and Bad protein levels in the DLBCL subtypes. These findings suggest that the different effects of IL-4 on chemotherapy and immunotherapy-induced cytotoxicity of GCB- and ABC-like DLBCL could contribute to the different clinical outcomes exhibited by patients with these two subtypes of DLBCL.

18056697|t|Male-to-female transsexuals show sex-atypical hypothalamus activation when smelling odorous steroids.
18056697|a|One working hypothesis behind transsexuality is that the normal sex differentiation of certain hypothalamic networks is altered. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of cerebral activation in 12 nonhomosexual male-to-female transsexuals (MFTRs) when smelling 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). These steroids are reported to activate the hypothalamic networks in a sex-differentiated way. Like in female controls the hypothalamus in MFTRs activated with AND, whereas smelling of EST engaged the amygdala and piriform cortex. Male controls, on the other hand, activated the hypothalamus with EST. However, when restricting the volume of interest to the hypothalamus activation was detected in MFTR also with EST, and explorative conjunctional analysis revealed that MFTR shared a hypothalamic cluster with women when smelling AND, and with men when smelling EST. Because the EST effect was limited, MFTR differed significantly only from male controls, and only for EST-AIR and EST-AND. These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features. Because our MFTRs were nonhomosexual, the results are unlikely to be an effect of sexual practice. Instead, the data implicate that transsexuality may be associated with sex-atypical physiological responses in specific hypothalamic circuits, possibly as a consequence of a variant neuronal differentiation.

9510858|t|Isolation and identification of a C39 demethylated metabolite of rapamycin from pig liver microsomes and evaluation of its immunosuppressive activity.
9510858|a|We studied in vitro metabolism of rapamycin using pig liver microsomes. After extraction of the metabolites from the incubation medium, the crude metabolite extract was submitted to normal and subsequently to reversed-phase HPLC chromatography. We describe in the current study a metabolite of retention time 23.2 min collected from reversed-phase HPLC and identified by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (MS) and electrospray MS-MS as a C39 demethylated rapamycin metabolite. In vitro immunosuppressive activity of this metabolite, determined by the mixed lymphocyte reaction, was negligible compared with that of the parent compound. The decrease of in vitro immunosuppressive activity compared with the parent compound is likely to be attributed to important structural modifications of the rapamycin binding region to the FK-506 binding protein.

23778534|t|Proteomic analysis of endothelial progenitor cells exposed to oxidative stress.
23778534|a|Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) repair vascular damage and participate in neovascularization. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that EPCs have therapeutic potential in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated vascular diseases. In this study, to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on EPCs, EPCs were treated with H2O2 at different final concentrations for 3 h. MTT assay, scratch-wound assay and Matrigel invasion assay revealed that cell proliferation, migration and tubule formation and function, respectively, were impaired under H2O2 stress in a concentration-dependent manner. To determine protein response to H2O2 stress, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry were performed. The results revealed that triosephosphate isomerase and ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase were downregulated, while peroxiredoxin-2, thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (Prx  -3), peroxiredoxin-6, EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, vimentin and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor a were upregulated in the H2O2-treated EPCs. To further confirm the results from mass spectrometry, the expression pattern of Prx-3 in response to H2O2 stress was examined by western blot analysis. The data presented in this study provide novel insight into the defensive mechanisms of EPCs and the pathways of oxidative damage in an oxidative environment.

16153828|t|Bioisosteric phentolamine analogs as potent alpha-adrenergic antagonists.
16153828|a|The synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of bioisosteric phentolamine analogs are described. Replacement of the carbon next to the imidazoline ring of phentolamine with a nitrogen atom provides compounds (2, 3) that are about 1.6 times and 4.1 times more potent functionally than phentolamine on rat alpha1-adrenergic receptors, respectively. In receptor binding assays, the affinities of phentolamine and its bioisosteric analogs were determined on the human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing the human alpha1- and alpha2-AR subtypes, respectively. Analogs 2 and 3, both, displayed higher binding affinities at the alpha2- versus the alpha1-ARs, affinities being the least at the alpha1B-AR. Binding affinities of the methoxy ether analog 2 were greater than those of the phenolic analog 3 at all six alpha-AR subtypes. One of the nitrogen atoms in the imidazoline ring of phentolamine was replaced with an oxygen atom to give compounds 4 and 5, resulting in a 2-substituted oxazoline ring. The low functional antagonist activity on rat aorta, and binding potencies of these two compounds on human alpha1A- and alpha2A-AR subtypes indicate that a basic functional group is important for optimum binding to the alpha1- and alpha2A-adrenergic receptors.

A 71-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes underwent a laminectomy for an epidural abscess. On the 6th and 8th postoperative days, he underwent debridement for fasciitis in the both arms and iodoform gauze was applied to the wounds (both arms and lumbar region) at the end of the first debridement and then changed every day. His consciousness then gradually deteriorated after the debridement. His plasma iodine level was measured and was shown to be remarkably high (6,280 microg/dl) 19 days after the laminectomy (13 days after the beginning of iodoform application). His consciousness recovered gradually with a concomitant decrease in the plasma iodine level. Three months after the removal of the iodoform he became almost alert. Caution should be exercised in using iodoform gauze because of the possibility that it could affect consciousness.

10983860|t|Azithromycin versus pivampicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a single-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study.
10983860|a|This single-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study compared oral azithromycin, administered as tablets, 500 mg once daily for 3 days, versus oral pivampicillin, 700 mg twice daily for 10 days, in adults with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (not needing parenteral antibiotic therapy, hospitalization or oxygen support). Clinical success (cure + improvement) rates were similar for both groups at the end of treatment (day 10; azithromycin, 124 of 133 [93%]; pivampicillin, 79 of 92 [86%]) and at follow-up (day 52; 98 of 126 [78%] versus 66 of 81 [81%]). The treatments produced similar levels of pathogen eradication at the end of treatment (49 of 54 [91%] versus 32 of 37 [86%]). Azithromycin-treated patients had significantly reduced chest discomfort at the end of treatment, and a trend towards improved lung function. The two groups were similar with respect to improvements in other clinical symptoms and patient well-being, and to the incidences of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. This oral azithromycin regime is an effective treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, similar in efficacy to the longer pivampicillin regime and may offer superior patient compliance.

12734218|t|Evaluation and utilization as a public health tool of a national molecular epidemiological tuberculosis outbreak database within the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2001.
12734218|a|The aim of this study was to develop a national model and analyze the value of a molecular epidemiological Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA fingerprint-outbreak database. Incidents were investigated by the United Kingdom PHLS Mycobacterium Reference Unit (MRU) from June 1997 to December 2001, inclusive. A total of 124 incidents involving 972 tuberculosis cases, including 520 patient cultures from referred incidents and 452 patient cultures related to two population studies, were examined by using restriction fragment length polymorphism IS6110 fingerprinting and rapid epidemiological typing. Investigations were divided into the following three categories, reflecting different operational strategies: retrospective passive analysis, retrospective active analysis, and retrospective prospective analysis. The majority of incidents were in the retrospective passive analysis category, i.e., the individual submitting isolates has a suspicion they may be linked. Outbreaks were examined in schools, hospitals, farms, prisons, and public houses, and laboratory cross-contamination events and unusual clinical presentations were investigated. Retrospective active analysis involved a major outbreak centered on a high school. Contact tracing of a teenager with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis matched 14 individuals, including members of his class, and another 60 cases were identified in schools clinically and radiologically and by skin testing. Retrospective prospective analysis involved an outbreak of 94 isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis cases in London, United Kingdom, that began after cases were identified at one hospital in January 2000. Contact tracing and comparison with MRU databases indicated that the earliest matched case had occurred in 1995. Subsequently, the MRU changed to an active prospective analysis targeting linked isoniazid-monoresistant isolates for follow up. The patients were multiethnic, born mainly in the United Kingdom, and included professionals, individuals from the music industry, intravenous drug abusers, and prisoners.

24342529|t|Flavonol intake and stroke risk: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.
24342529|a|OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic findings are inconsistent regarding the association between flavonol intake and the risk for stroke. The aim of this study was to determine whether an association exists between them in observational studies. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies conducted from 1966 to August 2013. Prospective cohort studies that provided relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between flavonol intake and risk for stroke were included. A random effects model was used to combine study-specific risk estimates. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included eight studies, with 5228 stroke cases among 280 174 participants. The summary RR indicated a significant association between highest flavonol intake and reduced risk for stroke (summary RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.99). Furthermore, an increase in flavonol intake of 20 mg/d was associated with a 14% decrease in the risk for developing stroke (summary RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96). Subgroup analyses suggested a significant inverse association between highest flavonol intake and stroke risk among men (summary RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97) but not women (summary RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). CONCLUSIONS: Higher dietary flavonol intake is associated with a reduced risk for stroke, especially among men. Our results support recommendations for higher consumption of flavonol-rich foods to prevent stroke.

18265708|t|Effect of Er:YAG laser treatment on the microstructure of the dentin/adhesive interface after acid-base challenge.
18265708|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Er:YAG laser ablation on the microstructure of the dentin/adhesive interface after acid-base challenge in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two extracted third molars were used. One pair of disk-shaped specimens was obtained from the midcoronal dentin of each tooth. One surface in each pair was subjected to Er:YAG laser irradiation, while the other was ground using 600-grit SiC abrasive paper. The specimens were assigned to 4 groups with 8 pairs in each group. A self-etching primer (Clearfil SE-Bond), a bonding adhesive (Clearfil SE-Bond), and a photocuring composite (Clearfil AP-X) were applied accordingto manufacturer's instructionsto create dentin-resin "sandwiches" of each pair, except in group IV, where no primer was applied. The specimens were stored in demineralizing solution for 20 min in groups I and IV, 60 min in group II, and 120 min in group III. After immersion in 5% NaOCl, all the specimens were polished and argon-ion etched. Finally, the interfaces between the dentin and bonding agent were observed under a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: All specimens in groups I to III showed an acid-base resistant zone, except those of group IV, which debonded completely. A statistically significant difference was found in the thickness of the acid-base resistant zone between group I vs groups II and III for both abraded and Er:YAG-irradiated surfaces. There was no statistically significant difference in the thickness of the acid-base resistant zone between groups II and III for both conventionally prepared and Er:YAG-irradiated surfaces. CONCLUSION: The existence of an acid-base resistant zone followingthe application of the SE Bond system on both abraded and Er:YAG-lased human dentin, regardless of the acid-base challenge duration, was confirmed.

18549926|t|In vitro and ex vivo anti-inflammatory activity of quercetin in healthy volunteers.
18549926|a|OBJECTIVE: Quercetin, a commonly occurring flavonoid and well known antioxidant, has been suggested to possess other beneficial activities. The present study investigated the possible anti-inflammatory effects of physiologically attainable quercetin concentrations. METHODS: The effects of quercetin were tested in vitro, i.e., added to blood in the test tube, and ex vivo and in vivo, i.e., in blood taken after 4 wk of administration of quercetin in an intervention study. RESULTS: Quercetin dose-dependently inhibited in vitro lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in the blood of healthy volunteers. At a concentration of 1 muM, quercetin caused a 23% reduction. The in vitro lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-10 production remained unaffected by quercetin. A 4-wk quercetin intervention resulted in a significant increase in plasma quercetin concentration. The supplementation also increased total plasma antioxidant status but did not affect glutathione, vitamin C, and uric acid plasma concentrations. Basal and ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were not altered by the intervention. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that quercetin increases antioxidant capacity in vivo and displays anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, but not in vivo or ex vivo, in the blood of healthy volunteers. This lack of effect is probably due to their low cytokine and high antioxidant levels at baseline, indicating that neither inflammation nor oxidative stress is present. Only in people with increased levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, e.g., patients with a disease of which the pathology is associated with these two processes, might antioxidant supplementation be fruitful.

22669426|t|Estrogen inhibits vaginal tropoelastin and TGF-b1 production.
22669426|a|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of estrogen on vaginal smooth muscle cell (SMC) tropoelastin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 production. METHODS: Primary SMC were incubated with estradiol, and cell proliferation was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at 48 h. Supernatants were collected and tropoelastin and TGF-b1 levels measured. RESULTS: SMC proliferation was significantly increased by estradiol [relative cell number, mean  ± standard error (SE), estradiol 0.1 µM 116  ± 19 % of control (P = NS), 1 µM 127  ± 13 % of control (P < 0.05), 10 µM 153  ± 26 % of control, (P < 0.05)]. Tropoelastin production was significantly decreased by estrogen [mean  ± SE, estradiol 0.1 µM 78  ± 2 % of control (P < 0.05), 1 µM 76  ± 4 % of control (P < 0.05), 10 µM 67  ± 3 % of control, (P < 0.05)]. In addition, TGF-b1 production was significantly decreased [mean  ± SE, estradiol 0.1 µM 96  ± 4 % of control (P = NS), 1 µM 84  ± 6 % of control (P < 0.05), 10 µM 70  ± 6 % of control, (P < 0.05)]. CONCLUSION: Estrogen increases vaginal SMC proliferation and inhibits tropoelastin and TGF-b1 production.

19862529|t|Recurrent pneumothorax associated with pulmonary nodules after leflunomide therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: a case report and review of the literature.
19862529|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by destructive synovitis and systemic extraarticular involvement. One of the most common pulmonary manifestations of RA is rheumatoid nodule. Spontaneous pneumothorax also very rare pulmonary finding and could be associated with pulmonary nodules. Antirheumatic drugs, methotrexate, leflunomide (LEF), infliximab and etanercept, were known as risk factors for developing rheumatoid nodule. However, there was no case report of rheumatoid nodule-associated pneumothorax with the use of LEF. We report, first, herein a case of 46-year-old woman with RA who suffered recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax associated with multiple bilateral subpleural cavitary nodules during treatment with LEF. We reviewed the cases of LEF-related pulmonary nodules developed in patients with RA. Thus, we suggested that pneumothorax can be a rare respiratory fatal complication in patients with RA with pulmonary nodules and LEF can be a rare cause of these manifestations.

11757882|t|A cross-national study of acute otitis media: risk factors, severity, and treatment at initial visit. Report from the International Primary Care Network (IPCN) and the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN).
11757882|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) differs worldwide. The Dutch avoid antimicrobials unless fever and pain persist; the British use them for 5 to 7 days, and Americans use them for 10 days. If effects of therapies are to be compared, it is necessary to evaluate rates of risk factors, severity of attacks, and their influence on treatment decisions. We wanted to compare the prevalence of risk factors for AOM and evaluate their association with severity of attacks and of severity with antimicrobial treatment. METHODS: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 2,165 patients with AOM enrolled by primary care physicians; 895 were enrolled from North America, 571 were enrolled from the United Kingdom, and 699 were enrolled from The Netherlands. The literature was searched using the key words "acute otitis media," "severity," and "international comparisons." RESULTS: The prevalence of several AOM risk factors differs significantly among patients from the three country networks; these factors include race, parent smoking habits, previous episodes, previous episodes without a physician visit, tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, frequency of upper respiratory tract infections, day care, and recumbent bottle-feeding. Dutch children have the most severe attacks as defined by fever, ear discharge, decreased hearing during the previous week, and moderate or severe ear pain. In country-adjusted univariate analyses, increasing age, exposure to tobacco smoke, day care, previous attacks of AOM, previous attacks without physician care, past prophylactic antimicrobials, ear tubes, adenoidectomy, and tonsillectomy all contribute to severity. Only country network, age, history of AOM, previous episode without physician care, and history of adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tubes are independently related to increased severity, while current breast-feeding is protective. Severity of attacks influences treatment decisions. Dutch children are least likely to receive antimicrobials, and even for severe attacks the British and Dutch physicians usually use amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfa; North American children with severe attacks are more likely to receive a broad-spectrum second-line antimicrobial. CONCLUSION: Dutch children have the highest ratings in all severity measures, possibly reflecting parental decisions about care seeking for earaches. When comparing groups of patients with AOM, it is necessary to adjust for baseline characteristics. Severity of episode affects physician treatment decisions. Adoption of Dutch guidelines restricting use of antimicrobials for AOM in the United States could result in annual savings of about $185 million.

20884859|t|WY-14 643, a selective PPAR{alpha} agonist, induces proinflammatory and proangiogenic responses in human ocular cells.
20884859|a|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa) agonism in ocular inflammation has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this investigation was to determine the effect of WY-14 643, a selective PPARa agonist, on inflammatory cytokine release in human ocular cells. Stimulation of primary human corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes, and retinal endothelial cells with 1 to 10 ng/mL interleukin 1b (IL-1b) resulted in a significant increase in numerous inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a); and dexamethasone was able to significantly inhibit these effects. However, WY-14 643 did not effectively block IL-1b-induced cytokine release in ocular cells; rather, significant increases in IL-1b-induced inflammatory cytokines were observed in these cells but not in aortic smooth muscle cells. WY-14 643 also significantly upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in corneal epithelial cells and keratocytes. These studies demonstrate for the first time that PPARa agonism may be proinflammatory and proangiogenic in a variety of ocular cells and suggest that therapeutic applications of such agents in ophthalmology may be limited.

24676508|t|Cardiovascular actions of GLP-1 and incretin-based pharmacotherapy.
24676508|a|Incretin-based therapy became recently available as antihyperglycemic treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Incretin therapy comprises glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4-I): these classes of drugs not only have the ability to reduce blood glucose, but also can exert several cardioprotective effects. They have been shown to positively influence some risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), to improve endothelial function, and to directly affect cardiac function. For these reasons incretins are considered not only antidiabetic drugs, but also cardiovascular effective. The first clinical trials aimed to demonstrate the safety of DPP4 inhibitors have been recently published: their clinical significance will be discussed in light of the prior experimental findings.

15662978|t|Phase II study of temozolomide and cisplatin as primary treatment prior to radiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients with measurable disease. A study of the Spanish Medical Neuro-Oncology Group (GENOM).
15662978|a|This phase II study evaluates the activity of temozolomide and cisplatin administered before radiation therapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients, in terms of response, time to progression and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with measurable disease after surgery, a Karnofsky status > 60, and Barthel Index > 10 were included. They were treated with three cycles of temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day for 5 days and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1. Conventional focal radiation therapy to 60 Gy was administered after response evaluation. RESULTS: Three patients were not evaluable for central reviewed response but all 40 were evaluable for toxicity, time to progression and survival. Objective responses by Macdonald criteria on an intent to treat basis were 45% including complete response in three patients (7.5%), and partial response in 15 patients (37.5%). Responses were seen in biopsy-only patients (33.4%) as well as in partial surgery patients (52%). Median survival for all patients was 12.5 months. Biopsy-only patients had a median survival of 12.8 months. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was the most important toxicity, and occurred in 37.5% of patients. A delay in 18.2% and a dose reduction in 9.6% of cycles were necessary due to myelosuppression on day 28. Two patients had neutropenic fever resulting in one treatment-related death. Eighty-two percent of patients received radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: This regimen has significant activity, as it induces objective responses even in biopsy-only patients, appearing to improve their median survival. A better combination schedule is needed to improve the toxicity profile.

22049203|t|Intravenous dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of refractory primary headaches.
22049203|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine dosing and side effects of dihydroergotamine as they affect outcomes in primary headache disorders. METHODS: We audited our use of dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of disabling primary headache, focusing on the commonly treated problems. RESULTS: Of patients interviewed, 114 had chronic migraine, 38 had cluster headache, and 11 had new daily persistent headache (NDPH). The mean time to follow-up for the entire cohort was 11 months. The data suggest that IV dihydroergotamine given over 5 days produces improvement in headache and disability in patients with migraine more than shorter courses. It does so with a cumulative effect after discharge up to a month. Giving more dihydroergotamine predicts a greater pain-free rate. Patients with cluster headache benefit from IV dihydroergotamine. In patients with NDPH, only those with migrainous symptoms responded and in that group the response was less robust compared with that seen in the chronic migraine cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous dihydroergotamine is well-tolerated, and longer treatments produce a better outcome. Nausea is the most common adverse effect, and its control is associated with a better outcome.

18305486|t|The relationship between hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction.
18305486|a|It is well known that testosterone enhances sexual interest leading to an increased frequency of sexual acts and an increase in the frequency of sleep-related erections. However, it has little effect on fantasy- or visually induced erections. Exact contribution to erection from testosterone in men remains unclear. Animal studies have well demonstrated that testosterone plays critical physiological (activity of nitric oxide synthases and phosphodiesterases), biochemical (through an endothelial-independent pathway and adrenergic tonicity) and structural (change of fibroelasticity and hollow cell accumulation) roles in erectile function. The supplementation of testosterone to castrated animals can restore erectile function. Clinically, reports of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) combined with hypogonadism who receive testosterone therapy have inconsistent results. However, testosterone may ameliorate the expression of the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, and the use of testosterone in conjunction with the PDE5 inhibitor revealed convincing results. Because of potential risks in clinical use, testosterone therapy should be individualized, carefully considered and closely monitored, especially, in patients with possible occult prostate cancer, and large benign prostatic hyperplasia. Lower urinary tract symptoms might be worsened by this treatment, since the prostate is an androgen-dependent tissue.

22932170|t|An uncontrolled open-label, multicenter study to monitor the antiviral activity and safety of inhaled zanamivir (as Rotadisk via Diskhaler device) among Chinese adolescents and adults with influenza-like illness.
22932170|a|BACKGROUND: It is the first multicenter clinical study in China to investigate zanamivir use among Chinese adolescents and adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) since 2009, when inhaled zanamivir (RELENZA( ®)) was marketed in China. METHODS: An uncontrolled open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the antiviral activity, and safety of inhaled zanamivir (as Rotadisk via Diskhaler device); 10 mg administered twice daily for 5 days in subjects >=  12 years old with ILI. Patients were enrolled within 48 hours of onset and followed for eight days. Patients were defined as being influenza-positive if the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test had positive results. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients >=  12 years old were screened from 11 centers in seven provinces from March 2010 to January 2011. Three hundred and ninety-two patients who took at least one dose of zanamivir were entered into the safety analysis. The mean age was 33.8 years and 50% were male. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. All the reported adverse events, such as rash, nasal ache, muscle ache, nausea, diarrhea, headache, occurred in less than 1% of subjects. Mild sinus bradycadia or arrhythmia occurred in four subjects (1%). Most of the adverse events were mild and did not require any change of treatment. No severe adverse events (SAE) or fatal cases were reported. Bronchospasm was found in a 38 years old woman whose symptoms disappeared after stopping zanamivir and without additional treatment. All the 61 influenza virus isolates (43 before enrollment, 18 during treatment) proved to be sensitive to zanamivir. CONCLUSIONS: Zanamivir is well tolerated by Chinese adolescents and adults with ILIs. There is no evidence for the emergence of drug-resistant isolates during treatment with zanamivir.

2089356|t|Double-blind study in the treatment of normal tension glaucoma with naftidrofuryl.
2089356|a|Naftidrofuryl is an antiserotonin S2-specific agent, with the three following effects: (1) peripheral vasodilatation, (2) antiaggregation and (3) increase in cellular metabolic. These effects could be interesting in the management of the optic nerve ischemia of glaucomatous patients and especially of those with normal tension glaucoma. The administration of 2 x 200 mg/day of naftidrofuryl during 6 weeks to 12 patients with normal tension glaucoma has shown an improvement of the visual acuity and the visual field compared with a 6-week period of placebo administration, with a double-blind study method. It suggested that naftidrofuryl might be administered as a useful complement to conventional hypotensive therapy, since it acts positively on the glaucomatous optic nerve damage.

16029794|t|Association of statin use with a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.
16029794|a|PURPOSE: To assess whether 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, might enhance the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1996 and 2001, 358 patients with clinically resectable, nonmetastatic rectal cancer underwent surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for either locally advanced tumors or low-lying tumors that would require abdominoperineal resection. We excluded 9 patients for radiation therapy dose <45 Gy or if statin use was unknown, leaving 349 evaluable patients. Median radiation therapy dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-55.8 Gy), and 308 patients (88%) received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Medication use, comorbid illnesses, clinical stage as assessed by digital rectal examination and ultrasound, and type of chemotherapy were analyzed for associations with pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as no microscopic evidence of tumor. Fisher's exact test was used for categoric variables, Mantel-Haenszel test for ordered categoric variables, and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (9%) used a statin, with no differences in clinical stage according to digital rectal examination or ultrasound compared with the other 324 patients. At the time of surgery, 23 nonstatin patients (7%) were found to have metastatic disease, compared with 0% for statin patients. The unadjusted pCR rates with and without statin use were 30% and 17%, respectively (p = 0.10). Variables significant univariately at the p = 0.15 level were entered into a multivariate model, as were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which were strongly associated with statin use. The odds ratio for statin use on pCR was 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-12.1; p = 0.003) after adjusting for NSAID use, clinical stage, and type of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: In multivariate analysis, statin use is associated with an improved pCR rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer. The low prevalence of statin use limits the power to detect a significant difference at a type I error threshold of p = 0.05 in this analysis. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn on the basis of this retrospective study, the unusually high incidence of pCR after chemoradiation suggests that the use of statins in the treatment of rectal cancer warrants further evaluation.

16815487|t|Fat oxidation and plasma removal capacity of an intravenous fat emulsion in elderly and young men.
16815487|a|OBJECTIVE: We explored metabolic and thermogenic responses to exogenous fat in relation to age as a basis for a rational design of parenteral nutrition in elderly patients. METHODS: Ten healthy elderly men (70-78 y of age, body mass index 21-27 kg/m(2)) and 10 healthy young men (19-45 y of age, body mass index 19-26 kg/m(2)) were studied with a hypertriglyceridemic clamp (primed infusion of a long-chain triacylglycerol emulsion to reach and stabilize at a triacylglycerol concentration of 4 mmol/L for 180 min). Continuous indirect calorimetry was carried out in the basal state and throughout the study period. RESULTS: The infusion rates required to maintain plasma triacylglycerol levels at 4 mmol/L were similar in elderly and young individuals (mean +/- SEM 0.201 +/- 0.027 versus 0.203 +/- 0.014 mmol/min, not significant). Plasma concentrations of free fatty acids and beta-OH-butyrate were higher in the elderly before the infusion and increased in a similar manner in both groups during infusion. Energy expenditure at baseline was higher in the young than in the elderly (79 +/- 2 versus 64 +/- 3 kcal/h; P < 0.001), although the respiratory quotient was similar in the two groups (0.80 +/- 0.01 versus 0.78 +/- 0.01, not significant). During lipid administration there was a similar increase in energy expenditure in the old and young individuals (+9.0 +/- 1.3% versus +6.0 +/- 1.8%, not significant). Lipid infusion resulted in similar increments in fat oxidation in the young and elderly (23.9 +/- 7.0% versus 15.1 +/- 4.9%, respectively, not significant). Plasma lipoprotein lipase activity was almost three times higher in the young than in the elderly subjects (0.23 +/- 0.02 versus 0.65 +/- 0.09 mU/mL, respectively, P < 0.001). During lipid infusion, a similar increment (four- to five-fold) in plasma lipoprotein lipase activity was noted in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly healthy men have a similar capacity as young healthy men to clear and oxidize a high triacylglycerol load administered as a hypertriglyceridemic clamp.

15088832|t|Ocular photodynamic therapy in choroidal neovascularization complicating idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy.
15088832|a|Two consecutive patients with idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy and decreased vision subsequent to subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes were treated with photodynamic therapy applied using the protocol of the Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic Therapy Study Group. Main outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopic appearance, and leakage on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. Photodynamic therapy offered anatomical, angiographic, and functional improvement. After an initial complete response, the patients required re-treatment at 3 and 4 months, respectively. Cessation of leakage with improvement in visual acuity occurred, but subretinal fibrosis posed a possible limitation for full functional recovery. Although choroidal neovascular membranes complicating idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy portend a poor visual prognosis, the overall response to photodynamic therapy was favorable.

16374211|t|Management of hepatitis C/HIV coinfection.
16374211|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: One third of HIV-infected individuals in Europe and the USA have a hepatitis C coinfection. With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV, liver disease caused by chronic hepatitis C virus infection has now become an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Therefore, treatment strategies for management of hepatitis C coinfection in HIV-infected individuals are urgently needed. RECENT FINDINGS: With the introduction of pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination therapy significantly improved treatment options for HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients have become available, leading to sustained virological response rates of over 40%. Increasing knowledge on the management of adverse events under hepatitis C therapy and optimized selection of antiretrovirals in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients has helped to reduce complications and improve overall treatment outcome. SUMMARY: Treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is safe and effective in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients. Longer treatment durations of 48 weeks are recommended for genotype 2 or 3. Positive predictive factors for sustained response are hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 and early treatment response.

11891102|t|Tubulo-interstitial nephritis caused by sodium valproate.
11891102|a|A severely handicapped 14-year-old Japanese girl had epilepsy and was treated with sodium valproate (SV) from the age of 7 years. Although the epileptic seizures were well controlled, she sometimes had a fever and hypokalemia from the age of 13 years. Laboratory examinations revealed metabolic acidosis, hypouricemia, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, proteinuria and aminoaciduria, thus suggesting Fanconi syndrome. Gallium scanning showed marked renal uptake. A renal biopsy revealed interstitial nephritis without immuno-deposition. SV was replaced since it was considered to be the most probable cause of the renal involvement. Thereafter, she showed marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and the laboratory data gradually, and she never had a fever. Although SV is an effective anti-epileptic drug, we have to pay attention to adverse renal effects such as Fanconi syndrome and interstitial nephritis.

15345198|t|Respiratory risks in tunnel construction workers.
15345198|a|Respiratory diseases are frequent in tunnel construction workers. A group of 144 subjects randomly selected from the population of 2516 workers engaged in the construction of the railway tunnel under the Appennine Mountains, from Bologna to Firenze was investigated. A group of 69 males comparable for age, living area and habits was studied as a control group. Assessment of air pollutants (NO, NO2, SO2, total dust, silica %) was carried out by means of fixed monitoring stations as well as personal monitors. All the subjects included in the study were examined with a standardised protocol which included physical examination, lung function tests (before and after shift work) and a questionnaire to college respiratory symptoms. Low concentrations of environmental pollutants were evidenced. Significantly lower values of FEV1 and PEF were determined in the worker group pared to controls. A significant decrease in respiratory parameters was shown after shift work. Variables capable of influencing the decrease in parameters include smoking habits, work activity, presence of cough and expectoration, period of the year (spirometries resulted worse in the winter time). Significantly lower values of FEV1 and PEF were evidenced in the workers compared to controls. In spite of the present low work environmental exposure conditions, some physiologic parameters appear altered in tunnel construction workers. This may depend on a variety of noxious agents present in the working environment.

10077512|t|Global biventricular dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease may be caused by myocarditis.
10077512|a|BACKGROUND: The causal role of asymptomatic critical coronary artery obstruction in patients presenting with severe global biventricular dysfunction but no evidence of myocardial infarction is uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 291 patients aged >40 years undergoing a noninvasive (2-dimensional echocardiography) and invasive (catheterization, coronary angiography, and biventricular endomyocardial biopsy, 6 to 8 samples/patient) cardiac study because of progressive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) with global biventricular dysfunction and no history of myocardial ischemic events, 7 patients (2.4%; 7 men; mean age, 49+/-6.9 years) had severe coronary artery disease (3 vessels in 4 patients; 2 vessels in 1 patient, proximal occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery in 2 patients). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction by 2-dimensional echocardiography were 73+/-10.5 mm and 23+/-6.5%, respectively, and right ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction were 39+/-7 mm and 29+/-7.2%, respectively. Biopsy specimens showed extensive lymphocytic infiltrates with focal myocytolysis meeting the Dallas criteria for myocarditis in all patients (in 5 patients with and 2 patients without fibrosis). Cardiac autoantibodies were detected with indirect immunofluorescence in the serum of 2 patients with active myocarditis. The 2 patients with active inflammation received prednisone (1 mg. kg-1. d-1 for 4 weeks followed by 0.33 mg. kg-1. d-1 for 5 months) and azathioprine (2 mg. kg-1. d-1 for 5 months) in addition to conventional drug therapy for heart failure. At 8-month overall follow-up, cardiac volume and function improved considerably in immunosuppressed patients but remained unchanged in conventionally treated patients, of whom 1 died. CONCLUSIONS: Global biventricular dysfunction in patients with severe asymptomatic coronary artery disease and no evidence of previous myocardial infarction may be caused by myocarditis. Histologic findings may influence the treatment.

24016507|t|Documentation of study medication dispensing in a prospective large randomized clinical trial: experiences from the ARISTOTLE Trial.
24016507|a|BACKGROUND: In ARISTOTLE, apixaban resulted in a 21% reduction in stroke, a 31% reduction in major bleeding, and an 11% reduction in death. However, approval of apixaban was delayed to investigate a statement in the clinical study report that "7.3% of subjects in the apixaban group and 1.2% of subjects in the warfarin group received, at some point during the study, a container of the wrong type." METHODS: Rates of study medication dispensing error were characterized through reviews of study medication container tear-off labels in 6,520 participants from randomly selected study sites. The potential effect of dispensing errors on study outcomes was statistically simulated in sensitivity analyses in the overall population. RESULTS: The rate of medication dispensing error resulting in treatment error was 0.04%. Rates of participants receiving at least 1 incorrect container were 1.04% (34/3,273) in the apixaban group and 0.77% (25/3,247) in the warfarin group. Most of the originally reported errors were data entry errors in which the correct medication container was dispensed but the wrong container number was entered into the case report form. Sensitivity simulations in the overall trial population showed no meaningful effect of medication dispensing error on the main efficacy and safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of medication dispensing error were low and balanced between treatment groups. The initially reported dispensing error rate was the result of data recording and data management errors and not true medication dispensing errors. These analyses confirm the previously reported results of ARISTOTLE.

8912966|t|Multiple recurrent branch retinal artery occlusions associated with varicella zoster virus.
8912966|a|PURPOSE: The authors describe an immunocompetent patient who developed multiple recurrent branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs) associated with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). METHODS: A 69-year-old woman with mild bilateral vitritis developed superior and inferior BRAOs in her right eye with decreased visual acuity to 20/40, and a peripheral BRAO inferotemporally in her left eye. One month later, the inferotemporal BRAO progressed proximally in her left eye with a decrease of visual acuity to 20/40. After an extensive negative systemic evaluation, she underwent a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy of her right eye. RESULTS: Vitreous fluid was positive for VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and systemic oral steroids. After remaining disease free for 3 months, the patient had two recurrences: 1) a mild vitritis and 2) development of a new superior temporal artery occlusion in the left eye. Both recurrences were treated with oral acyclovir and systemic steroids. The patient remained recurrence free for 12 months on a maintenance dose of oral acyclovir, and for 4 additional months without acyclovir. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella zoster virus can be associated with the syndrome of multiple recurrent BRAOs. The diagnosis of VZV-associated BRAO can be established by PCR of intraocular fluid.

18719443|t|Novel ryanodine receptor mutation that may cause malignant hyperthermia.
18719443|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a hypermetabolic condition caused by a genetic disposition leading to increased Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after exposure to triggering agents. In the authors' ongoing evaluation of patients undergoing MH testing in Austria, they detected a family with a new variant of the ryanodine receptor 1. Guidelines suggest that genetic tests are possible only for individuals from families in which the mutations are known. The aim of this study was to provide functional data that establish a potential link between this new variant and susceptibility to MH, and thus enable application in genetic tests. METHODS: Messenger RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle cells grown in culture and used for synthesis of complementary DNA, which served as a template for 23 polymerase chain reactions. The sequences of all reaction products were analyzed. Functional studies in differentiated muscle cells included the Ca releasing activity of caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. The authors measured the intracellular Ca concentration and, in combined patch clamp-Ca detection experiments, the voltage dependence of the Ca release. RESULTS: In a single family, the authors found a transition from a highly conserved thymine to cysteine at position 11953, leading to the exchange of tryptophan to arginine at position 3985. This variant was absent in 100 MH-nonsusceptible individuals. Functionally, cells carrying this variant were more sensitive to caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol than wild-type cells and showed a shift in the voltage-dependent Ca release to more negative potentials. CONCLUSION: These data document a role of the new W3985R variant in MH susceptibility.

21791936|t|Indomethacin impairs coronary perfusion in infants with hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus.
21791936|a|BACKGROUND: A haemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus (HSDA) is commonly associated with morbidity in preterm infants. AIM: To study the effect of the first dose of indomethacin on coronary blood flow in preterm neonates diagnosed with an HSDA. METHOD: A prospective observational echocardiographic study was performed on preterm infants. A single study dose of intravenous indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg) was administered over 1 h. Serial echocardiography was performed before and after indomethacin treatment to study the effect on coronary artery perfusion and cardiovascular performance. RESULTS: Eighteen infants born at a median gestation of 25.8 (24.2, 28.1) weeks and a birth weight of 773 g (704, 1,002) were evaluated. The median age at indomethacin administration was 7.5 days (4, 17). There was no significant change in arterial pressure or ventilatory indices. Left anterior descending artery diastolic velocity and time integral declined from 0.3  ± 0.1 and 3.19  ± 1.2 m/s to 0.22  ± 0.08 and 2.01  ± 0.9 m/s, respectively, within 10 min of completion of infusion. These indices showed partial recovery when reassessed after 60 min. There were no changes in left ventricular output or transductal flow. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous indomethacin was followed by a decline in coronary arterial diastolic blood flow.

12803319|t|Immunological effects of thalidomide and its chemical and functional analogs.
12803319|a|Thalidomide has recently shown considerable promise in the treatment of a number of conditions, such as leprosy and cancer. Its effectiveness in the clinic has been ascribed to wide-ranging properties, including anti-TNF-alpha, T-cell costimulatory and antiangiogenic activity. Novel compounds with improved immunomodulatory activity and side effect profiles are also being evaluated. These include selective cytokine inhibitory drugs (SelCIDs), with greatly improved TNF-alpha inhibitory activity, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) that are structural analogs of thalidomide, with improved properties. A third group recently identified within the SelCID group, with phosphodiesterase type 4-independent activity, is in the process of being characterized in laboratory studies. This review describes the emerging immunological properties of thalidomide, from a historical context to present-day clinical applications, most notably in multiple myeloma but also in other cancers, inflammatory disease, and HIV. We also describe the laboratory studies that have led to the characterization and development of SelCIDs and IMiDs into potentially clinically relevant drugs. Early trial data suggest that these novel immunomodulatory compounds may supercede thalidomide to become established therapies, particularly in certain cancers. Further evidence is required, however, to correlate the clinical efficacy of these compounds with their known immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties.

25552168|t|Comparison of estrogen and betamethasone in the topical treatment of labial adhesions in prepubertal girls.
25552168|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: To compare estrogen and betamethasone in the topical treatment of labial adhesions in prepubertal girls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated 39 girls with labial adhesions covering at least 50% of the vaginal opening. Of the total patients, 20 were treated with a topical estrogen preparation, while the remaining 19 patients were treated with a combination of betamethasone cream and petroleum ointment (Vaseline) for 3 to 9 weeks. RESULTS: Sixteen of 20 (80%) patients in the estrogen treatment group were treated successfully with topical estrogen cream only, and 17 of 19 (89.4%) patients in the second group were treated successfully with a combination of betamethasone cream and petroleum ointment. Two patients (2/20) in the estrogen treatment group underwent a surgical procedure for the manual separation of the labial adhesion. One patient (1/19) treated with betamethasone cream and petroleum ointment required a manual separation procedure. We observed a side effect of labial enlargement in 2 patients (10%) who were treated with estrogen only, while the only side effect of the betamethasone treatment was local irritation, which occurred in a single patient (5.2%). In addition, the success rate of the betamethasone treatment exceeded that of the topical estrogen (89.4% and 80%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Betamethasone cream with petroleum ointment is a safe and effective primary therapy for prepubertal labial adhesions.

21384452|t|GST pi modulates JNK activity through a direct interaction with JNK substrate, ATF2.
21384452|a|Human GSTpi, an important detoxification enzyme, has been shown to modulate the activity of JNKs by inhibiting apoptosis and by causing cell proliferation and tumor growth. In this work, we describe a detailed analysis of the interaction in vitro between GSTpi and JNK isoforms (both in their inactive and active, phosphorylated forms). The ability of active JNK1 or JNK2 to phosphorylate their substrate, ATF2, is inhibited by two naturally occurring GSTpi haplotypes (Ile105/Ala114, WT or haplotype A, and Val105/Val114, haplotype C). Haplotype C of GSTpi is a more potent inhibitor of JNK activity than haplotype A, yielding 75-80% and 25-45% inhibition, respectively. We show that GSTpi is not a substrate of JNK, as was earlier suggested by others. Through binding studies, we demonstrate that the interaction between GSTpi and phosphorylated, active JNKs is isoform specific, with JNK1 being the preferred isoform. In contrast, GSTpi does not interact with unphosphorylated, inactive JNKs unless a JNK substrate, ATF2, is present. We also demonstrate, for the first time, a direct interaction: between GSTpi and ATF2. GSTpi binds with similar affinity to active JNK + ATF2 and to ATF2 alone. Direct binding experiments between ATF2 and GSTpi, either alone or in the presence of glutathione analogs or phosphorylated ATF2, indicate that the xenobiotic portion of the GSTpi active site and the JNK binding domain of ATF2 are involved in this interaction. Competition between GSTpi and active JNK for the substrate ATF2 may be responsible for the inhibition of JNK catalysis by GSTpi.

14718589|t|Imatinib-mesylate blocks recombinant T-type calcium channels expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells by a protein tyrosine kinase-independent mechanism.
14718589|a|The 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative imatinib-mesylate, a powerful protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor that targets abl, c-kit, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors, is rapidly gaining a relevant role in the treatment of several types of neoplasms. Because first generation PTK inhibitors affect the activity of a large number of voltage-dependent ion channels, the present study explored the possibility that imatinib-mesylate could interfere with the activity of T-type channels, a class of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels that take part in the chain of events elicited by PTK activation. The effect of the drug on T-type channel activity was examined using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique with Ba2+ (10 mM) as the permeant ion in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, stably expressing the rat Ca(V)3.3 channels. Imatinib-mesylate concentrations, ranging from 30 to 300 microM, reversibly decreased Ca(V)3.3 current amplitude with an IC(50) value of 56.9 microM. By contrast, when imatinib-mesylate (500 microM) was intracellularly dialyzed with the pipette solution, no reduction in Ba2+ current density was observed. The 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative modified neither the voltage dependence of activation nor the steady-state inactivation of Ca(V)3.3 channels. The decrease in extracellular Ba2+ concentration from 10 to 2 mM and the substitution of Ca2+ for Ba2+ increased the extent of 30 microM imatinib-mesylate-induced percentage of channel blockade from 25.9 +/- 2.4 to 36.3 +/- 0.9% in 2 mM Ba2+ and 44.2 +/- 2.3% in 2 mM Ca2+. In conclusion, imatinib-mesylate blocked the cloned Ca(V)3.3 channels by a PTK-independent mechanism. Specifically, the drug did not affect the activation or the inactivation of the channel but interfered with the ion permeation process.

18679595|t|Enhancement of recombinant human ADAM15 disintegrin domain expression level by releasing the rare codons and amino acids restriction.
18679595|a|This study was aimed at increasing the production of the recombinant human ADAM15 disintegrin domain (RADD) in Escherichia coli by releasing the rare codons and restricting amino acid residues. Three different strategies for increasing RADD production were examined: to select the suitable host strain, to optimize the rare codons, and to delete the amino acids residues. The total fusion protein glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-RADD concentration of 298 mg/l and 326 mg/l were achieved by selecting E. coli Rosetta (DE3) as the host strain and by changing GGA to GGC at the GST-RADD cassette, respectively. The RADD concentration was increased by 35.7% by eliminating the "Pro-Glu-Phe" residues at the GST-RADD junction. By combinational utilizing the preferred codon introduction and amino acid sequence optimization in E. coli Rosetta (DE3), the highest RADD concentration of 68 mg/l was achieved. The proposed strategy may provide an alternative approach for other enhanced recombinant protein production by E. coli.

10391496|t|Inhibitory effects of adrenaline on the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves in human dental pulp.
10391496|a|The effects of adrenaline on the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves in human dental pulp in vitro were examined. Sympathetic nerves were stimulated at 5 Hz for 100 sec following incubation of pulp with [3H]noradrenaline (0.6 micromol/l). In the presence of desipramine (DMI, 0.3 micromol/l), adrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micromol/l) inhibited the release of [3H]noradrenaline, an effect which was inhibited by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (0.1 micromol/l) and by the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 (0.1 micromol/l). The release of [3H]noradrenaline was unaffected by adrenaline (0.001 and 0.01 micromol/l) in the presence of DMI and DMI plus rauwolscine. Although presynaptic inhibitory alpha2- and facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors are present on sympathetic nerves in human dental pulp, these results imply that adrenaline activates only the inhibitory alpha2-receptors.

22716215|t|Chloroquine enhances the chemotherapeutic activity of 5-fluorouracil in a colon cancer cell line via cell cycle alteration.
22716215|a|Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that degrades cytoplasmic proteins and organelles for recycling. The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is controversial because autophagy can be either protective or damaging to tumor cells, and its effects may change during tumor progression. A number of cancer cell lines have been exposed to chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, with the aim of inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell death. In addition, chloroquine inhibits a late phase of autophagy. This study was conducted to investigate the anti-cancer effect of autophagy inhibition, using chloroquine together with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a colon cancer cell line. Human colon cancer DLD-1 cells were treated with 5-FU (10 µÎ) or chloroquine (100 µÎ), or a combination of both. Autophagy was evaluated by western blot analysis of microtubule-associated protein light chain3 (LC3). Proliferative activity, alterations of the cell cycle, and apoptosis were measured by MTT assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting. LC3-II protein increased after treatment with 5-FU, and chloroquine potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. MTT assays showed that 5-FU inhibited proliferation of the DLD-1 cells and that chloroquine enhanced this inhibitory effect of 5-FU. The combination of 5-FU and chloroquine induced G1 arrest, up-regulation of p27 and p53, and down-regulation of CDK2 and cyclin D1. These results suggest that chloroquine may potentiate the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU via cell cycle inhibition. Chloroquine potentiates the anti-cancer effect of 5-FU in colon cancer cells. Supplementation of conventional chemotherapy with chloroquine may provide a new cancer therapy modality.

7647979|t|Intrinsic activity of the non-prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, daltroban (BM 13,505), in human platelets in vitro and in the rat vasculature in vivo.
7647979|a|1. We evaluated the effects of daltroban on (i) human platelet shape change and aggregation in vitro, and (ii) mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures (MAP and MPAP, respectively) as well as haematocrit, in anaesthetized, open-chest Sprague-Dawley rats, compared with those of a chemically distinct prostanoid thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548, and agonist, U-46619. 2. In human platelets in vitro, daltroban (10 nM-100 microM; n = 6 per group) concentration-dependently induced shape change, attaining at 50 microM, a maximum amplitude of 0.83 +/- 0.09 mV representing 46.4 +/- 4.8% of that evoked by U-46619 (1.78 +/- 0.20 mV at 0.2 microM; n = 9); and inhibited U-46619-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 77 (41-161)nM. SQ 29,548 (10 nM-100 microM; n = 6 per group) failed to evoke any platelet shape change, but potently inhibited U-46619-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 < 10 nM. 3. In anaesthetized rats in vivo, daltroban (10-2500 micrograms kg-1, i.v. infused over 2 min; n = 4-8 per group) produced a bell-shaped dose-response curve for MPAP and haematocrit, and evoked maximal increases of 12.7 +/- 2.1 mmHg and 5.8 +/- 1.5% at 80 micrograms kg-1 (n = 6) and 630 micrograms kg-1 (n = 8), respectively (both P < 0.05) with ED50s of 20 (16-29) and 217 (129-331) micrograms kg-1, respectively. By comparison, U-46619(0.16-20 microg kg-1, i.v.), induced dose-dependent increases in MPAP and haematocrit (25.4 +/- 1.0 mmHg and 16.1 +/- 2.9% at the highest dose; n = 12, both P<0.01), with ED50s of 1.8 (1.3-2.5) and 3.9(3.5- 5.4) microg kg- 1, respectively. Daltroban dose-dependently increased MAP with a maximum amplitude of 42.2 +/- 4.4 mmHg at a dose of 80 microg kg-1 [ED50 = 94 (64-125) microg kg-1], similar to that induced by U-46619 (41.3 +/- 9.6 mmHg) at a dose of 0.63 microg kg-1 [ED50= 0.22 (0.13-0.24) microg kg-1]. SQ 29,548(10-2500 microg kg-1, i.v.; n =4 per group) failed to modify significantly any of these parameters.4. Our results clearly demonstrate that daltroban, in a similar manner to the TxA2 analogue, U-46619,but unlike the TxA2 receptor antagonist, SQ 29,548, exhibits significant intrinsic activity in human platelets in vitro and in the rat vasculature in vivo, possibly through TxA2 receptor activation.

23829234|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous cellular messenger molecule in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. Mitochondrion is the main area where endogenous NO is synthesized by inducible NOS enzymes in mammalian cells. Thus, real-time monitoring NO in mitochondria is very meaningful for NO chemical biology. Although a variety of fluorescent probes for NO have been successfully developed, they are not suited for detecting mitochondrial NO because none of them can specifically localize in mitochondria. Herein, Mito-Rh-NO, the first mitochondria-targetable "turn-on" fluorescent probe for NO, has been developed through attaching a triphenylphosphonium to a rhodamine spirolactam. The characteristics of this probe are as following: (1) Mito-Rh-NO exhibits high sensitivity toward NO. In solution, Mito-Rh-NO responds to NO by significant fluorescence enhancement up to 60-fold, and its NO detection limit is as low as 4.0 nM. (2) The NO sensing of Mito-Rh-NO is highly selective, which will not interfere with the other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. (3) Mito-Rh-NO has a low cytotoxic effect: after being treated with 10 µM Mito-Rh-NO for 24 h, the survival rate is higher than 90%. (4) Mito-Rh-NO specifically localizing in mitochondria: colocalization experiment of Mito-Rh-NO and Rh 123, a typical mitotracker, shows the merged fluorescent microcopy image with a high Pearson's colocalization coefficient 0.92 and overlap coefficient 0.99. (5) Mito-Rh-NO demonstrates high applicability for real-time monitoring of mitochondrial NO in live cells. Both the exogenous NO released by the donor NOC13 and endogenous NO generated in cells under stimulation have been visualized under confocal microscopy.

21957973|t|Metal allergy and second-generation metal-on-metal arthroplasties.
21957973|a|There are concerns about the induction of metal allergy with second-generation metal-on-metal prostheses, and the role that this may play in the development of complications such as 'pseudotumours' or failure of the implant. In this review, we attempt to set out the current knowledge on this subject. From a review of the literature, it is apparent that the first-generation metal-on-metal replacement hips did cause metal sensitization, and that joint failure was associated with this, although it is still not clear which one led to the other. Highly engineered second-generation metal-on-metal arthroplasties used in joint resurfacings are now increasingly employed. Several studies have recently shown an association between metal sensitization and peri-implant hypersensitivity reactions and implant loosening and failure, although the overall risk appears to be low. The pragmatic approach adopted by most contact dermatologists for patients known to be allergic to nickel, cobalt or chromium and who require joint replacement is to recommend prostheses made of titanium-based alloys. Patch testing continues to be a useful tool as laboratory investigations for metal hypersensitivity continue to emerge. The development of guidelines on the management of patients receiving metal-on-metal arthroplasties suspected of being metal-allergic is desirable.

19015962|t|R(+)-methanandamide-induced apoptosis of human cervical carcinoma cells involves a cyclooxygenase-2-dependent pathway.
19015962|a|PURPOSE: Cannabinoids have received renewed interest due to their antitumorigenic effects. Using human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), this study investigates the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in apoptosis elicited by the endocannabinoid analog R(+)-methanandamide (MA). METHODS: COX-2 expression was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. PGE2/PGD2 levels in cell culture supernatants and DNA fragmentation were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: MA led to an induction of COX-2 expression, PGD2 and PGE2 synthesis. Cells were significantly less sensitive to MA-induced apoptosis when COX-2 was suppressed by siRNA or the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. COX-2 expression and apoptosis by MA was also prevented by the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1, but not by antagonists to cannabinoid receptors and TRPV1. In line with the established role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in the proapoptotic action of PGs of the D and J series, inhibition of MA-induced apoptosis was also achieved by siRNA targeting lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS) or PPARgamma. A role of COX-2 and PPARgamma in MA-induced apoptosis was confirmed in another human cervical cancer cell line (C33A) and in human lung carcinoma cells (A549). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates COX-2 induction and synthesis of L-PGDS-derived, PPARgamma-activating PGs as a possible mechanism of apoptosis by MA.

17407365|t|Serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced perinatal complications.
17407365|a|There are a growing number of concerns about the utilization of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in late pregnancy and the onset of perinatal complications. This review aimed to analyze and summarize the studies evaluating the risk of perinatal complications (such as low birth weight, preterm delivery, withdrawal or toxic phenomena, and other detrimental events/poor neonatal outcomes) related to maternal SRI use in late pregnancy. A computerized search of MEDLINE (1966-January 2007) and PsycINFO (1974-January 2007) databases was performed. Articles describing perinatal complications after late in utero exposure to SRIs were selected and also reviewed for additional references. Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. Exposure to SRIs late in pregnancy is clearly associated with an increased risk of infants developing a constellation of symptoms, including CNS and respiratory effects, often requiring close infant observation and supportive or specific treatment in intensive care units. Such symptoms are not always due to toxic or withdrawal reactions. Indeed, some evidence suggests that SRIs may interfere with the physiology of the respiratory system and parasympathetic activity in neonates. Of the most methodologically relevant studies reviewed, 50% have been published in the last 3 years. Hence, it is possible that further concerning data will become available in the future. For these reasons, the opportunity of tapering and discontinuing SRIs in late pregnancy should be taken into consideration, although to date the evidence to support such a clinical decision is preliminary.

23497788|t|Impact of DCS-facilitated cue exposure therapy on brain activation to cocaine cues in cocaine dependence.
23497788|a|BACKGROUND: The development of addiction is marked by a pathological associative learning process that imbues incentive salience to stimuli associated with drug use. Recent efforts to treat addiction have targeted this learning process using cue exposure therapy augmented with d-cycloserine (DCS), a glutamatergic agent hypothesized to enhance extinction learning. To better understand the impact of DCS-facilitated extinction on neural reactivity to drug cues, the present study reports fMRI findings from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DCS-facilitated cue exposure for cocaine dependence. METHODS: Twenty-five participants completed two MRI sessions (before and after intervention), with a cocaine-cue reactivity fMRI task. The intervention consisted of 50mg of DCS or placebo, combined with two sessions of cocaine cue exposure and skills training. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated cocaine cue activation in a variety of brain regions at baseline. From the pre- to post-study scan, participants experienced decreased activation to cues in a number of regions (e.g., accumbens, caudate, frontal poles). Unexpectedly, placebo participants experienced decreases in activation to cues in the left angular and middle temporal gyri and the lateral occipital cortex, while DCS participants did not. CONCLUSIONS: Three trials of DCS-facilitated cue exposure therapy for cocaine dependence have found that DCS either increases or does not significantly impact response to cocaine cues. The present study adds to this literature by demonstrating that DCS may prevent extinction to cocaine cues in temporal and occipital brain regions. Although consistent with past research, results from the present study should be considered preliminary until replicated in larger samples.

16454977|t|Comparison of short- and mid-term outcomes between CYPHER and TAXUS stents in patients with complex lesions of the coronary arteries.
16454977|a|BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stent (DES) could obviously reduce in-stent restenosis, which has been proved by international multi-center clinical trials. However, the types of the lesions for stenting were highly selected in these trials. Up to now, there has been no large scale study on the effect of DES in treating complex lesions in real world. Although REALITY trial was just reported during American College of Cardiology Congress 2005, the entry criteria for lesions were limited to one or two de novo lesions. This study was conducted to compare the short- and mid-term clinical outcomes between sirolimus-eluting stent (CYPHER stent) and paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS stent) in patients with complex lesion. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. From April 2002 to June 2004, a total of 1061 patients were treated with DES in Fu Wai Hospital, of which, 611 patients (642 lesions with 698 CYPHER stents) were in CYPHER group, and 450 patients (534 lesions with 600 TAXUS stents) were in TAXUS group. There was no significant difference in clinical data and lesion types between CYPHER group and TAXUS group. RESULTS: Success rates of stent implantation were 99.2% and 98.8% in CYPHER and TAXUS stent groups respectively. The major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during in-hospital and 6-8-month follow-up were 0.7% and 2.3% in CYPHER stent group versus 1.3% and 3.2% in TAXUS stent group. There was no significant difference in MACE rate between these two groups. Restenosis rate was a little higher in TAXUS stent group than that in CYPHER stent group (14.0% vs 7.3%), but there was no significant difference. The incidence of acute occlusion of side branch after implanting DES in main vessel was 6.9% in CYPHER group and 11.9% in TAXUS group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CYPHER and TAXUS DES were safe and effective in patients with complex lesion. Clinical outcomes of CYPHER stent were better than TAXUS stent in bifurcation lesions. There was an increasing tendency in restenosis rate and late thrombosis in TAXUS group as compared with that of CYPHER group.

24460797|t|Switch from tenofovir to raltegravir increases low bone mineral density and decreases markers of bone turnover over 48 weeks.
24460797|a|BACKGROUND: Tenofovir, particularly when given with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (rPI), reduces bone mineral density (BMD) and increases bone turnover markers (BTMs), both of which are associated with increased fracture risk. Raltegravir has not been associated with bone loss. METHODS: In an open-label, nonrandomized, pilot study, tenofovir was switched to raltegravir in adults also receiving a rPI for at least 6 months with a spine or hip T-score  <=   -1.0 and plasma HIV RNA < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL for at least 3 months. The primary endpoint was BMD change by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Student's paired t-test was used to compare continuous variables. Factors associated with BMD increase were assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in the study: 97% were male, the mean age was 49 years, the mean T-scores were -1.4 (spine) and -1.3 (total left hip), and the mean tenofovir treatment duration was 3.1 years. BMD increases were significant at weeks 24 and 48. At week 48, spine BMD increased by 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9, 4.0%; P < 0.0001] and left total hip BMD increased by 2.5% (95% CI 1.6, 3.3%; P < 0.0001). BTMs (N-telopeptide, osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase) all decreased significantly at week 24 (P  <= 0.0017). There were no raltegravir-related serious or grade 3-4 adverse events. HIV viral load remained <50 copies/mL plasma on raltegravir/rPI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Switching virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults with low BMD taking an rPI from tenofovir to raltegravir was safe and significantly improved hip and spine BMD and reduced markers of bone turnover over 48 weeks.

24777654|t|Cardiovascular effects of drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease.
24777654|a|Drugs that are used to treat Alzheimer's disease include the acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors (ACHIs) donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. Adverse cardiovascular events with these drugs are very uncommon. However, there is evidence that ACHI therapy is associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of syncope and bradycardia. There are also a few reports that these drugs may occasionally be associated with QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Adverse cardiovascular effects of ACHIs including syncope and bradycardia are less common than their adverse gastrointestinal effects, but they remain important considerations in susceptible individuals. In contrast, animal studies and some observational studies suggest that ACHIs may reduce myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality and have favourable effects on hemodynamics and survival in heart failure. Further research is required to confirm these potential beneficial effects. Little is known about the cardiovascular effects of memantine but there have been reports of bradycardia and reduced cardiovascular survival associated with its use.

7648164|t|Effect of aberrant hepatic arterial anatomy on tumour response to hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine for colorectal liver metastases.
7648164|a|Regional hepatic artery infusion of colorectal liver metastases produces the highest reported treatment response. The effect of variation in hepatic artery anatomy on tumour response to regional floxuridine (FUdR) was studied. Aberrant hepatic arterial anatomy occurred in 13 of 74 patients (18 per cent) who underwent cannulation of the hepatic artery and infusion of FUdR for colorectal liver metastases. The non-dominant hepatic artery was ligated and the dominant artery cannulated in those with aberrant anatomy. Despite evidence of a collateral circulation to the non-dominant area of the liver in these patients, there was no significant reduction in median tumour volume with treatment (before treatment 214 ml, after treatment 339 ml). By contrast, there was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in median tumour volume (before treatment 329 ml, after treatment 148 ml) in those with normal anatomy. Delivery of FUdR to metastases via an intrahepatic collateral circulation was not as effective as through a main hepatic artery.

16302678|t|Acute lupus myocarditis: clinical features and outcome of an oriental case series.
16302678|a|Symptomatic myocarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncommon. We describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of 11 SLE patients without any atherosclerotic risk factors, who presented with acute lupus myocarditis (ALM). All patients were female, 46% Chinese with mean age of 27 +/- 10 years at diagnosis of SLE. ALM was one of the initial manifestations of SLE in eight (73%) patients. The median duration from onset ALM to initiation of treatment was two weeks (range: 0.3-8). All had clinical feature of left ventricle dysfunction. The most common electrocardiographic feature was nonspecific ST/T wave changes (91%). Common echocardiographic findings included segmental wall motion abnormalities (81%) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (81%). Median SLE disease activity index at presentation was 16 (range: 4-30). All patients received high dose corticosteroids and 64% received intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide. There were two deaths (18%) from infections. The remaining nine survivors had no recurrence of ALM nor suffer any SLE-related damage (median SLICC damage score of 0), up to a median follow-up of four years (range: 2.5-10.1). Repeat echocardiography after six months or later showed normal LVEF in eight patients (89%). Early immunosuppressive therapy in ALM, with high dose corticosteroids and pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide, results in good cardiac outcome.

18635408|t|Development and validation of a rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy assay for determination of 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and 17-(amino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in human plasma.
18635408|a|A sensitive method was developed and validated for the measurement of 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) and its active metabolite 17-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AG) in human plasma using 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17DMAG) as an internal standard. After the addition of internal standard, 200 microL of plasma was extracted using ice cold acetonitrile followed by analysis on a Thermo Finnigan triple-quadruple mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Chromatography was carried out on a 50 mm x 2.1 mm Agilent Zorbax SB-phenyl 5 microm column coupled to a 3mm Varian metaguard diphenyl pre-column using glacial acetic acid 0.1% and a gradient of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 500 microL/min. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and detection of 17AAG, 17AG and 17DMAG were accomplished using selected reaction monitoring of m/z 584.3>541.3, 544.2>501.2, and 615.3>572.3, respectively in negative ion mode. Retention times for 17AAG, 17AG, and 17DMAG were 4.1, 3.5, and 2.9 min, respectively, with a total run time of 7 min. The assay was linear over the range 0.5-3000 ng/mL for 17AAG and 17AG. Replicate sample analysis indicated within- and between-run accuracy and precision within 15%. The recovery of 17AAG and 17AG from 200 microL of plasma containing 1, 25, 300, and 2500 ng/mL was 93% or greater. This high-performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC/MS/MS) method is superior to previous methods. It is the first analytical method reported to date for the quantitation of both 17AAG and its metabolite 17AG and can reliably quantitate concentrations of both compounds as low as 0.5 ng/mL.

20837883|t|Aldosterone synthase inhibition with LCI699: a proof-of-concept study in patients with primary aldosteronism.
20837883|a|We report the first administration of an orally active aldosterone synthase inhibitor, LCI699, to 14 patients with primary aldosteronism. After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients received oral LCI699 (0.5 mg BID) for 2 weeks, LCI699 (1.0 mg BID) for 2 weeks, and placebo for 1 week. We assessed changes in hormone concentrations, plasma potassium levels, and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure and safety. The supine plasma aldosterone concentration decreased from 540 pmol/L (95% CI: 394 to 739 pmol/L) to 171 pmol/L (95% CI: 128 to 230 pmol/L) after 0.5 mg of LCI699 (-68%; P<0.0001) and to 133 pmol/L (95% CI: 100 to 177 pmol/L) after 1.0 mg of LCI699 (-75%; P<0.0001). Plasma 11-deoxycorticosterone concentrations increased by 710% after 0.5 mg of LCI699 (P<0.0001) and by 1427% after 1.0 mg of LCI699 (P<0.0001). The plasma potassium concentration increased from 3.27 ±0.31 to 4.03 ±0.33 mmol/L (P<0.0001) after only 1 week on 0.5 mg of LCI699. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure decreased by -4.1 mm Hg (95% CI: -8.1 to -0.1 mm Hg) after 4 weeks of treatment (P=0.046). Basal plasma cortisol concentrations remained unchanged, whereas plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations increased by 35% after 0.5 mg of LCI699 (P=0.08) and by 113% after 1.0 mg of LCI699 (P<0.0001), and the plasma cortisol response to an adrenocorticotropic hormone test was blunted. All of the variables except plasma 11-deoxycorticosterone concentration returned to initial levels after the placebo. LCI699 was well tolerated. In conclusion, the administration of LCI699, up to 1.0 mg BID, effectively and safely inhibits aldosterone synthase in patients with primary aldosteronism. This 4-week treatment corrected the hypokalemia and mildly decreased blood pressure. The effects on the glucocorticoid axis were consistent with a latent inhibition of cortisol synthesis.

25313576|t|Patterns of dietary intake and serum carotenoid and tocopherol status are associated with biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk.
25313576|a|Dietary modification may affect inflammatory processes and protect against chronic disease. In the present study, we examined the relationship between dietary patterns, circulating carotenoid and tocopherol concentrations, and biomarkers of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in a 10-year longitudinal study of Scottish postmenopausal women. Diet was assessed by FFQ during 1997-2000 (n 3237, mean age 54 ·8 (SD 2 ·2) years). Participants (n 2130, mean age 66 ·0 (SD 2 ·2) years) returned during 2007-11 for follow-up. Diet was assessed by FFQ (n 1682) and blood was collected for the analysis of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, serum amyloid A, E-selectin, lipid profile and dietary biomarkers (carotenoids, tocopherols and retinol). Dietary pattern and dietary biomarker (serum carotenoid) components were generated by principal components analysis. A past 'prudent' dietary pattern predicted serum concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 (which decreased across the quintiles of the dietary pattern; P= 0 ·002 and P= 0 ·001, respectively; ANCOVA). Contemporary dietary patterns were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. The concentrations of hs-CRP and IL-6 decreased across the quintiles of the 'prudent' dietary pattern (P= 0 ·030 and P= 0 ·006, respectively). hs-CRP concentration increased across the quintiles of a 'meat-dominated' dietary pattern (P= 0 ·001). Inflammatory biomarker concentrations decreased markedly across the quintiles of carotenoid component score (P< 0 ·001 for hs-CRP and IL-6, and P= 0 ·016 for E-selectin; ANCOVA). Prudent dietary pattern and carotenoid component scores were negatively associated with serum hs-CRP concentration (unstandardised b for prudent component: -0 ·053, 95% CI -0 ·102, -0 ·003; carotenoid component: -0 ·183, 95% CI -0 ·233, -0 ·134) independent of study covariates. A prudent dietary pattern (which reflects a diet high in the intakes of fish, yogurt, pulses, rice, pasta and wine, in addition to fruit and vegetable consumption) and a serum carotenoid profile characteristic of a fruit and vegetable-rich diet are associated with lower concentrations of intermediary markers that are indicative of CVD risk reduction.

24038567|t|Treatment of hepatitis C monoinfection in adults--Dutch national guidelines.
24038567|a|In this new Dutch guideline for hepatitis C virus infection we provide recommendations for the management of hepatitis C infection. Until 2012 the standard for treatment consisted of pegylated interferon alpha (peg-IFNa) and ribavirin. The advent of first-generation direct antiviral agents such as boceprevir and telaprevir has changed the concept of treatment of adult chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infected patients. There are three benefits of boceprevir and telaprevir. They increase the likelihood of cure in 1) naive genotype 1 patients and 2) in patients who did not respond to earlier treatment with peg-IFNa and ribavirin, while 3) allowing shortening of treatment duration from 48 weeks to 24 or 28 weeks, which is possible in 40-60% of non-cirrhotic naive (boceprevir and telaprevir) and relapsing patients (telaprevir). The use of boceprevir and telaprevir is associated with multiple side effects and awareness of these side effects is needed to guide the patient through the treatment process. This guideline, formulated on behalf of The Netherlands Association of Hepato-gastroenterologists, The Netherlands Association of Internal Medicine, and The Dutch Association for the Study of Liver Disease, serves as a manual for physicians for the management and treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis C virus monoinfection in adults.

23979886|t|Genotoxic evaluation of the antimalarial drugs artemisinin and artesunate in human HepG2 cells and effects on CASP3 and SOD1 gene expressions.
23979886|a|The malaria treatment recommended by the World Health Organization involves medicines derived from artemisinin, an active compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua, and some of its derivatives, such as artesunate. Considering the lack of data regarding the genotoxic effects of these compounds in human cells, the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and expressions of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes in a cultured human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cells) treated with artemisinin and artesunate. We tested concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 µg/mL of both substances with a resazurin cytotoxicity assay, and the concentrations used in the genotoxicity experiments (2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL) and gene expression analysis (5 µg/mL) were determined. The results of the comet assay in cells treated with artemisinin and artesunate showed a significant dose-dependent increase (P < 0.001) in the number of cells with DNA damage at all concentrations tested. However, the gene expression analysis revealed no significant change in expression of CASP3 or SOD1. Our data showed that although artemisinin and artesunate exhibited genotoxic effects in cultured HepG2 cells, they did not significantly alter expression of the CASP3 and SOD1 genes at the doses tested.

7796076|t|Assessing the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy: the short synacthen versus the insulin tolerance test.
7796076|a|The short synacthen test (SST) is an effective method of assessing the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with pituitary disease. Chronic glucocorticoid therapy may result in suppression of the HPA axis, and use of the SST has not been evaluated in these patients. This study compares the SST with the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy. Both tests were done on 22 patients on long-term, stable-dose prednisolone (< 10 mg/day). A pass was defined as a 30 minute plasma cortisol > 550 nmol/l for the SST and a maximal cortisol of > 500 nmol/l for the ITT. Five patients passed both tests; nine failed both. Eight patients had discrepant results; all passed the ITT but failed the SST. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.001) between the maximum cortisol level achieved during the ITT and the 30 min SST value and the incremental rise. There was an inverse correlation between the dose and duration of use of steroids and the cortisol response during both tests. The SST is a reliable, safe and easily performed initial assessment of the HPA axis in patients on long-term corticosteroids. The ITT remains a valuable test for those who fail the SST.

11820622|t|Estrogen receptor based in vitro assays for the evaluation of endocrine disrupters.
11820622|a|An increasing number of environmental chemicals is suspected to act similarly as endogenous estrogens at concentrations far below the so called "No Observed Adverse Effect Levels". In man, as in wildlife, these substances are held responsible for several reproductive disorders e.g. the decline in sperm quality and the increase in testicular cancer incidence in different countries worldwide. Several in vitro bioassays have recently been developed to screen single compounds for their ability to bind to estrogen receptors (ER) resulting in a hormone specific response. However, divergent results from these assays indicate the lack of validation and standardisation. Moreover, the proven cell specificity of estrogen response questions the relevance of the observed effects and necessitates the development of assays in a fertility related cellular context.

23812022|t|Does rocuronium-sugammadex reduce myalgia and headache after electroconvulsive therapy in patients with major depression?
23812022|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the effects of succinylcholine and rocuronium-sugammadex on development of myalgia and headache after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: Forty-five patients undergoing ECT were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia induction was provided with propofol 1 mg/kg intravenously (IV) + succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV in group S (n = 24) and propofol 1 mg/kg IV + rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg IV in group R (n = 21). Sugammadex 4 mg/kg IV was administered to group R after the motor seizure. The first 3 ECT sessions were evaluated on the basis of time to onset of spontaneous respiration following the induction, time to eye-opening response to verbal stimuli, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for myalgia and headache at hours 2, 6, 12, and 24 following the ECT for all patients. RESULTS: The times to onset of spontaneous respiration and eye-opening response to verbal stimuli were significantly shorter in all the 3 sessions in group R compared with group S (P < 0.002). Myalgia VAS scores at hours 2, 6, and 12 and the headache VAS scores at hours 2 and 6 were significantly higher in group S versus group R (P < 0,015). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the rates of myalgia and headache after ECT were significantly lower in group R than in group S, and also the awakening time (spontaneous respiration and opening the eyes in response to verbal stimuli) was significantly shorter in group R compared with group S.

16677158|t|Pantoprazole infusion as adjuvant therapy to endoscopic treatment in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding: prospective randomized controlled trial.
16677158|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Following successful endoscopic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding, rebleeding occurs in 20% of patients. Rebleeding remains the most important determinant of poor prognosis. We investigated whether or not administration of pantoprazole infusion would improve the outcome in ulcer bleeding following successful endoscopic therapy. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial, patients who had gastric or duodenal ulcers with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel received combined endoscopy therapy with injection of epinephrine and heater probe application. Patients who achieved hemostasis were randomly assigned to receive pantoprazole (80 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion at a rate of 8 mg per hour) or placebo for 72 h. The primary end-point was the rate of rebleeding. RESULTS: Rebleeding was lower in the pantoprazole group (8 of 102 patients, 7.8%) than in the placebo group (20 of 101 patients, 19.8%; P = 0.01). Patients in the pantoprazole group required significantly fewer transfusions (1 +/- 2.5 vs 2 +/- 3.3; P = 0.003) and days of hospitalization (5.6 +/- 5.3 vs 7.7 +/- 7.3; P = 0.0003). Rescue therapies were needed more frequently in the placebo group (7.8% vs 19.8%; P = 0.01). Three (2.9%) patients in the pantoprazole group and eight (7.9%) in the placebo group required surgery to control their bleeding (P = 0.12). Two patients in the pantoprazole group and four in the placebo group died (P = 0.45). CONCLUSION: In patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, the use of high dose pantoprazole infusion following successful endoscopic therapy is effective in reducing rebleeding, transfusion requirements and hospital stay.

11364012|a|As a first-time regimen against HIV, treatment with zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) plus a protease inhibitor is not recommended. If resistance to 3TC develops, it could jeopardize the effectiveness of other subsequent drugs. In addition, peripheral neuropathy caused by didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC) or stavudine (d4T) is most commonly reported in late-stage AIDS patients, indicating that regimens including ddI, d4T, or ddC probably should be administered earlier in the course of disease.

16647085|t|Alcohol-impaired driving and its consequences in the United States: the past 25 years.
16647085|a|INTRODUCTION: Progress in dealing with the alcohol-impaired driving problem in the United States during the past 25 years is addressed. METHODS: Trends in various measures of the problem were tracked and a thorough review of the relevant literature conducted. RESULTS: In the 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s, major decreases occurred in alcohol-impaired driving and its consequences. The contribution of alcohol to fatal crashes dropped by 35-40% during this period. Two primary reasons for the decline appear to be the emergence of citizen activist groups that mobilized public support and attention to the problem, and the proliferation of effective laws. Since about 1995 the alcohol-impaired driving problem has stabilized at a reduced but still quite high level. CONCLUSIONS: Highway safety organizations and citizen activist groups have continued to highlight the problem, but its status as a social issue has diminished. We basically know what the primary target groups are, and we know measures that would work to reduce the problem if implemented more fully. We know that political leadership, state task forces, and media advocacy are important ingredients in addressing the problem. It is likely that a resurgence in citizen activism will be necessary to foster these elements and refocus the nation on the unfinished battle against alcohol-impaired driving. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Alcohol-impaired driving is still a major problem that needs continuing attention.

15165985|t|Na+/Ca2+ exchanger overexpression impairs frequency- and ouabain-dependent cell shortening in adult rat cardiomyocytes.
15165985|a|The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) may influence cardiac function depending on its predominant mode of action, forward mode or reverse mode, during the contraction-relaxation cycle. The intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) and the duration of the action potential as well as the level of NCX protein expression regulate the mode of action of NCX. [Na(+)](i) and NCX expression have been reported to be increased in human heart failure. Nevertheless, the consequences of altered NCX expression in heart failure are still a matter of discussion. We aimed to characterize the influence of NCX expression on intracellular Ca(2+) transport in rat cardiomyocytes by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. A five- to ninefold (dose dependent) overexpression of NCX protein was achieved after 48 h by somatic gene transfer (Ad.NCX.GFP) versus control (Ad.GFP). NCX activity, determined by Na(+) gradient-dependent (45)Ca(2+)-uptake, was significantly increased. The protein expressions of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, phospholamban, and calsequestrin were unaffected by NCX overexpression. Fractional shortening (FS) of isolated cardiomyocytes was significantly increased at low stimulation rates in Ad.NCX.GFP. After a step-wise enhancing frequency of stimulation to 3.0 Hz, FS remained unaffected in Ad.GFP cells but declined in Ad.NCX.GFP cells. The positive inotropic effect of the cardiac glycoside ouabain was less effective in Ad.NCX.GFP cells, whereas the positive inotropic effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation remained unchanged. In conclusion, NCX overexpression results in a reduced cell shortening at higher stimulation frequencies as well as after inhibition of sarcolemmal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, i.e., in conditions with enhanced [Na(+)](i). At low stimulation rates, increased NCX expression enhances both intracellular systolic Ca(2+) and contraction amplitude.

12780674|t|The use of an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody and mycophenolate mofetil enables the use of a low-dose tacrolimus and early withdrawal of steroids in renal transplant recipients.
12780674|a|BACKGROUND: Reducing calcineurin-inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity and simultaneously avoiding long-term steroid related side-effects is a desirable goal in renal transplantation. We examined the hypothesis that using anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody induction and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) would allow the lowering of target pre-dose blood concentrations of tacrolimus immediately after transplantation and subsequently stopping steroids at 5 months. METHODS: Eighty-two kidney recipients were enrolled in a single-center study comparing two tacrolimus-based protocols. Group I (n = 41) patients received a standard-dose tacrolimus (blood concentration 10-15 ng/mL) with MMF and a standard dose corticosteroid. Group II (n = 41) patients were treated with a low-dose tacrolimus (blood concentration 5-10 ng/mL) and MMF, a low-dose corticosteroid (stopped after 5 months) and induction with daclizumab. RESULTS: Patient (95.1 versus 100%) and graft survival (92.6 versus 97.5%) at 1 yr were not different between groups. Patients of group II experienced significantly less acute rejections than group I (17.1 versus 41.4% p = 0.03). Delayed graft function occurred less often in group II (5 versus 12% p = 0.43). Graft function at 1 yr was significantly better in group II (serum creatinine 1.49 versus 1.69 mg/dL and creatinine clearance 59.6 versus 49 mL/min; p < 0.05). Corticosteroids could be stopped after 5 months in 82.9% of group II patients. CONCLUSION: A regimen consisting of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody induction and MMF allows the safe and efficient use of low-target pre-dose trough concentrations of tacrolimus and enables the early discontinuation of steroids. Preliminary results indicate a better 1-yr graft function compared to a normal-dose tacrolimus regimen.

15562885|t|An evaluation of the ocular drying effects of 2 systemic antihistamines: loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride.
15562885|a|BACKGROUND: Systemic antihistamines, such as loratadine and cetrizine hydrochloride, have proven efficacious in the control of many allergic conditions; however, patients complain about their drying effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ocular drying effects of loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride in individuals with normal ocular health exposed to a controlled adverse environment (CAE). METHODS: Eighteen individuals completed a randomized, double-masked study. Participants were evaluated in a CAE (a chamber that regulates humidity, temperature, airflow, and visual tasking) at baseline and after taking 10 mg of either loratadine or cetirizine hydrochloride daily for 4 days. Keratitis, conjunctival staining, and tear film break-up time (TFBUT) were examined before and after a 45-minute CAE exposure. Participant-reported ocular discomfort was recorded every 5 minutes during CAE challenge. RESULTS: After 4 days, use of loratadine yielded a mean increase of 0.75 points (107%) in keratitis (P < .001), a mean increase of 1.35 points (133%) in conjunctival staining (P < .001), a mean decrease of 1.38 seconds (33.7%) in TFBUT (P < .001), and a mean increase of 0.32 points (24.8%) in ocular discomfort (P = .05) vs baseline. After 4 days, use of cetirizine hydrochloride yielded a mean increase of 0.57 points (60%) in keratitis (P < .001), a mean increase of 0.7 points (49.7%) in conjunctival staining (P = .005), and a mean decrease of 0.76 seconds (19.6%) in TFBUT (P = .05) vs baseline. Loratadine was shown to induce 93% greater conjunctival staining after 4 days of use and CAE exposure vs cetirizine hydrochloride (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride induced signs and symptoms associated with ocular dryness, including increased corneal and conjunctival staining, decreased TFBUT, and increased ocular discomfort in healthy individuals. Loratadine induced significantly more conjunctival staining than cetirizine hydrochloride.

2260347|t|Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent.
2260347|a|Fluconazole is a fluorine-substituted, bis-triazole antifungal agent. Its mechanism of action, like that of other azoles, involves interruption of the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via binding to fungal cytochrome P-450 and subsequent disruption of fungal membranes. Activity against Aspergillus spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida spp., Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been demonstrated in several animal models. Fluconazole can be administered both orally and intravenously. Mean peak serum concentrations achieved in human volunteers after 50 and 100 mg (oral) are 3.1 and 7.0 mumols/L respectively. Protein binding is low (11 percent) and cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratio is 0.58 to 0.89. Serum half-life is long (22-32 hours) and elimination is via renal clearance of unchanged drug. Clinical trials and reports support the use of fluconazole in treatment of candidiasis, particularly oropharyngeal and esophageal infections in immunocompromised hosts. Fluconazole is also approved for initial and suppressive therapy of cryptococcal meningitis. Its role in management of systemic fungal infections will be further defined once results of other comparative trials become available. Fluconazole is well tolerated and its effects on steroidogenesis are markedly less than those of ketoconazole. Antipyrine clearance is not altered at low doses (50 mg) of fluconazole; however, drug interactions with the use of larger doses can be anticipated with agents such as cyclosporin, phenytoin, oral hypoglycemics, and warfarin. Rifampin appears to decrease metabolic clearance of fluconazole. Fluconazole is available as oral and parenteral formulations. Once-daily doses of 100-400 mg are recommended. Dosage reduction is advised for patients with impaired renal function.

9784245|t|Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C): identification of protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites.
9784245|a|Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a major myofibril-associated protein in cardiac muscle which is subject to reversible phosphorylation. Cardiac MyBP-C is a substrate in vivo and in vitro for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC). Chicken cardiac MyBP-C was phosphorylated by PKA to 3.0 mol phosphate/mol and by PKC to 2.0 mol phosphate/mol. Tryptic phosphopeptides from MyBP-C were purified by successive iron iminodiacetate column chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Three phosphopeptides purified from PKA-phosphorylated MyBP-C contained phosphoserine [T1, (RTS[P]LAGGGR) and T2, (KRDS[P]FLR)] or phosphothreonine (CT3, MT[P]SAFL). PKC phosphorylated two of the same sites (T1 and T2) as PKA and an additional site [T2a (TGTTYKPPS[P]YK)]. PKA phosphorylation sites corresponding to peptides T1, T2, and T3 were identified in the N-terminus of the cDNA deduced amino acid sequence (S265, S300, and T274, respectively). The PKC-specific site in peptide T2a was at position S1169. cDNA clones encoding rat cardiac MyBP-C were isolated, and the segment corresponding to PKA and major PKC phosphorylation sites was sequenced. Chicken cardiac MyBP-C has a threonine at position 274 (CT3), whereas rat cardiac MyBP-C has a serine at the corresponding position. Only chicken cardiac MyBP-C had a phosphorylatable residue at the position corresponding to S1169. All of the cardiac MyBP-C phosphorylation sites are absent in known sequences of skeletal muscle MyBP-C isoforms.

11230737|t|Inhibition of intrahepatic metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma by Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y-27632.
11230737|a|Intrahepatic metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cell motility mediated by Rho- and p160 Rho-associated coiledcoil forming protein kinase (p160ROCK) signaling pathways has recently been shown to play a critical role in intrahepatic metastasis in human HCC. Furthermore, the stable introduction of dominant-negative p160ROCK into Li7 cells resulted in a reduced metastatic rate in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). To investigate whether the specific p160ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, could also inhibit intrahepatic metastasis, the effect of Y-27632 on the cell motility and intrahepatic metastasis of Li7 was investigated. Y-27632 markedly blocked actin reorganization and motility of Li7 cells mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Y-27632 was administered continuously into the peritoneal cavity using a micro-osmotic pump, together with orthotopic implantation of Li7 cells into the liver of SCID mice. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone was administered as the control. The incidence of mice with metastatic nodules decreased in the Y-27632-treated group. The primary tumor volume at the site of injection was smaller in the Y-27632-treated group compared with the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Histologically, control tumors showed infiltrative growth into the sinusoidal area at the tumor boundary, whereas Y-27632-treated tumors showed expansive growth and low invasiveness. These findings confirm the importance of the Rho/p160ROCK signaling pathway in intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC, and indicate that Y-27632 may be useful for the prevention of intrahepatic metastasis of human HCC.

19803708|t|Discovery, mechanisms of action and combination therapy of artemisinin.
19803708|a|Despite great international efforts, malaria still inflicts an enormous toll on human lives, especially in Africa. Throughout history, antimalarial medicines have been one of the most powerful tools in malaria control. However, the acquisition and spread of parasite strains that are resistant to multiple antimalarial drugs have become one of the greatest challenges to malaria treatment, and are associated with the increase in morbidity and mortality in many malaria-endemic countries. To deal with this grave situation, artemisinin-based combinatory therapies (ACTs) have been introduced and widely deployed in malarious regions. Artemisinin is a new class of antimalarial compounds discovered by Chinese scientists from the sweet wormwood Artemisia annua. The potential development of resistance to artemisinins by Plasmodium falciparum threatens the usable lifespan of ACTs, and therefore is a subject of close surveillance and extensive research. Studies at the Thai-Cambodian border, a historical epicenter of multidrug resistance, have detected reduced susceptibility to artemisinins as manifested by prolonged parasite-clearance times, raising considerable concerns on resistance development. Despite this significance, there is still controversy on the mode of action of artemisinins. Although a number of potential cellular targets of artemisinins have been proposed, they remain to be verified experimentally. Here, we review the history of artemisinin discovery, discuss the mode of action and potential drug targets, and present strategies to elucidate resistance mechanisms.

8818533|t|Hormone replacement therapy for women after breast carcinoma.
8818533|a|The use of hormone replacement therapy after the diagnosis of breast cancer has been contra-indicated because of the fear of precipitating a relapse. However, many survivors of breast cancer experience debilitating symptoms as a consequence of oestrogen deficiency and over the long term are at an increased risk of dying prematurely from cardiovascular disease or a hip fractures because they are denied hormone replacement therapy. The past year saw definitive reviews on this subject as well as publication of the largest case-controlled study of hormone therapy in women with a history of breast cancer. The encouraging findings of these non-randomized studies have prompted the commencement of prospective studies to evaluate the benefits and risks of this practice. It is no longer contra-indicated to prescribe hormone replacement therapy to selected women after a history of breast cancer but it remains controversial and more information is required.

17619868|t|Serum and cerebrospinal fluid morphine pharmacokinetics after single doses of intravenous and intramuscular morphine after hip replacement surgery.
17619868|a|AIM: To compare the time course of morphine and metabolite concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after intravenous and intramuscular administration after surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized double-blind, double-dummy study in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. Morphine (M, 10 mg) was administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Arterial blood and CSF samples (from a spinal catheter) were drawn simultaneously at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min after administration. Morphine and metabolites [morphine-3-glucuronide (M-3-G), morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G), and normorphine (NM)] were determined by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included: 13 men and 25 women, 20 in the IV, 18 in the IM group. Serum concentrations of M after 10 min were consistently higher after IM than IV, concentrations of M-3-G and M-6-G after IM surpassed those of IV after 45 min. NM was not found. None of the metabolites was found in CSF. CSF morphine concentrations and CSF/serum concentration ratios were consistently higher after IV compared to IM. The mean AUC(CSF)/AUC(serum) (0-120 min) concentration ratios were 0.18 and 0.09 after IV and IM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of morphine to the CSF was consistently higher after IV administration than after IM already after 10 min. The higher CSF concentration may be caused by an initially higher morphine blood/CSF gradient following IV morphine injection. The pharmacokinetic findings are compatible with a more rapid and extensive initial effect of IV morphine compared with IM.

10454679|t|Labor induction with misoprostol.
10454679|a|Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E(1 ) analog, is widely used in the United States for cervical ripening and labor induction. Its use for these indications is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved indication in the product labeling is the treatment and prevention of intestinal ulcer disease resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use. Multiple trials have proved that misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction in term pregnancy; however, investigations continue regarding the optimal dose, dosing regimen, and route of administration. Uterine contraction abnormalities are often found in association with higher misoprostol doses. Some trials also indicate increased frequencies of meconium passage, neonatal acidemia, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress in women receiving higher doses of misoprostol. Overall, most trials fail to demonstrate a significant change in the cesarean delivery rate with the use of this agent. Misoprostol is an effective agent for cervical ripening and labor induction when used in a judicious and cautious fashion.

10454675|t|Peripartum cardiomyopathy: summary of an international survey on peripartum cardiomyopathy.
10454675|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to assess the evaluation, management, and future recommendations of patients with the diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy and to evaluate the interest in the creation of a prospective database regarding this rare disorder. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 116 surveys were sent to major teaching institutions in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Crete, and South Korea after a national conference held at the National Institutes of Health regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy. This was an open-ended survey containing 17 specific questions regarding this disorder and its management. RESULTS: A total of 78 (67%) maternal-fetal specialists responded to the survey. Diuretics and digoxin were used as first-line treatment for this disorder. Only 6% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of the perinatologists (58%) recommended either intrauterine contraceptive devices or foam and condoms, whereas oral contraceptives (progesterone-only pill or estrogen-progesterone mix) were recommended in 23% and 41%, respectively. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents would recommend future pregnancy if ventricular function returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental clinical and basic research is lacking regarding this rare but potentially devastating disorder. Major teaching institutions do not have significant numbers of patients with this disorder to provide concrete recommendations, and starting a database will be useful in the gathering of important epidemiologic information. A secondary aim of such a registry would be to establish a repository for tissue and blood samples to answer basic mechanistic questions about this disorder.

19661481|t|Saturated fatty acids do not directly stimulate Toll-like receptor signaling.
19661481|a|OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate inflammatory signaling in response to conserved microbial molecules. It has been proposed that dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) may also serve as endogenous ligands of TLR2 or TLR4, thereby promoting diseases associated with inflammation and dyslipidemia, including atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of SFAs on TLR-dependent signaling using a broad range of cell types and readouts. In HEK-293 cells transfected with TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5, SFAs complexed with fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA)-stimulated TLR-dependent signaling. However, SFAs alone did not elicit a similar response. Further analysis showed that the effect seen with the complexed SFAs was attributable to LPS and lipopeptide contamination of fatty-acid-free BSA. Additional studies in macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed the lack of stimulation of TLR-dependent signaling pathways or expression of TLR-target genes by SFAs. CONCLUSIONS: SFAs do not directly stimulate TLR-dependent signaling, suggesting that alternative mechanisms link dietary fat intake with TLR-associated pathologies. LPS and lipopeptide contamination of the widely used reagent fatty-acid-free BSA explains the previously reported stimulation of TLR2 and TLR4 by SFAs.

19157985|t|Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia.
19157985|a|Potent and clinically significant analgesic effects can be brought about by opioids acting outside the central nervous system. Injury and inflammation of peripheral tissues leads to increased synthesis, axonal transport, membrane-directed trafficking and G-protein coupling of opioid receptors in dorsal root ganglion neurons. These events are dependent on neuronal electrical activity, cytokines and nerve growth factor and lead to an enhanced analgesic efficacy of peripherally active opioids. Leukocytes infiltrating inflamed tissue upregulate signal-sequence-encoding mRNA for beta-endorphin and its processing enzymes. Depending on the cell type and stimulus, the opioid release is contingent on extracellular Ca2+ or on release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum. Analgesia results from inhibition of sensory neuron excitability and of proinflammatory neuropeptide release.

21209368|t|Akt directly regulates focal adhesion kinase through association and serine phosphorylation: implication for pressure-induced colon cancer metastasis.
21209368|a|Although focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is typically considered upstream of Akt, extracellular pressure stimulates cancer cell adhesion via Akt-dependent FAK activation. How Akt regulates FAK is unknown. We studied Akt-FAK interaction in colon cancer cells under 15 mmHg increased extracellular pressure. Pressure enhanced Akt-FAK association, blocked by inhibiting FAK or silencing Akt1 but not Akt2, and stimulated FAK serine phosphorylation in Caco-2 and human colon cancer cells from surgical specimens Akt1-dependently. FAK includes three serine (S517/601/695) and one threonine (T600)-containing consensus sequences for Akt phosphorylation. Studying S->A nonphosphorylatable point mutants suggests that these sites coordinately upregulate FAK Y397 tyrosine phosphorylation, which conventionally initiates FAK activation, and mediate pressure-induced cancer cell adhesion. FAK(T600A) mutation did not prevent pressure-induced FAK(Y397) phosphorylation or adhesion. Akt1 appeared to directly bind FAK, and this binding did not depend on the FAK autophosphorylation site (Y397). In addition, our results demonstrated that Akt phosphorylated FAK at three novel serine phosphorylation sites, which were also not required for FAK-Akt binding. This novel interaction suggests that FAK and Akt may be dual kinase targets to prevent cancer cell adhesion and metastasis.

19478337|t|Protein and antioxidants in an isocaloric carbohydrate drink: effect on plasma oxidative-stress markers and IL-6.
19478337|a|The purpose of this study was to determine whether an isocaloric beverage with added protein and vitamins (CHOPA) would influence oxidative stress and inflammation after cycling to exhaustion as indicated by plasma protein carbonyls (PC), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Twelve trained men (18-33 yr) volunteered and performed this randomized crossover study. Participants cycled at 70% VO2peak until fatigue and at 80% VO2peak 22-24 hr later to fatigue with either carbohydrate or CHOPA. Blood collected before the cycling at rest and 24, 48, and 72 hr after the exercise was analyzed for PC and LOOH spectrophotometrically and for IL-6 via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data were analyzed with SPSS using repeated-measures ANOVA. PC demonstrated significant treatment (p = .037) and time (p = .004) effects with no Treatment x Time interaction. PC was higher in the CHOPA treatment than with CHO independent of time and increased at 24 (48%), 48 (59%), and 72 (67%) hr after exercise compared with preexercise values. Resting LOOH and IL-6 did not have any significant changes with time or treatment. These data indicate that an isocaloric CHOPA drink after 2 cycling bouts to exhaustion will exacerbate the resting PC level compared with an isocaloric drink, with no influence on plasma LOOH or IL-6. In addition, a modest significant increase in PC over time independent of treatment occurred, which suggests a mild oxidative stress in the days after exhaustive exercise.

17451279|t|Biphasic insulin aspart in type 2 diabetes mellitus: an evidence-based medicine review.
17451279|a|The efficacy benefits of biphasic insulin aspart formulation (BIAsp 30) in patients with diabetes mellitus have been reported in several studies. BIAsp 30 has been shown to be more effective in terms of glycaemic control than standard biphasic human insulin 30 (BHI 30). In addition to gauging the treatment in terms of clinical evidence of benefits provided, it is also important to evaluate the strength of the evidence supporting the therapeutic improvements offered by BIAsp 30. In this paper, we evaluated the strength of the available data that relate to the use of BIAsp 30 in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes based on a comprehensive literature review. Selected publications that provided relevant data were obtained via a literature search and from the manufacturer, Novo Nordisk. These were graded in terms of the strength of the evidence they provided using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) system in the following categories: (i) twice-daily use versus basal insulin; (ii) twice-daily use versus other treatments; (iii) once-daily use; (iv) thrice-daily use; (v) use in combination with thiazolidinediones; and (vi) use in comparison with BHI 30. A total of 30 publications for BIAsp 30 were identified and graded. For the majority of categories (four out of six), the evidence supporting the use of BIAsp 30 was given an overall CEBM grade of A (highest quality); evidence supporting clinical efficacy in the other two categories (twice-daily use versus basal insulin and thrice-daily BIAsp 30 administration) was graded B. In most of the studies examined, the efficacy of BIAsp 30 was evaluated in terms of glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] reduction, proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) target of <6.5% or <7%, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose profile and/or prandial and postprandial glucose increments). In some studies, efficacy was further evaluated using plasma insulin and glucose infusion rates, plasma C-peptide levels, mean serum fructosamine levels, postprandial hyperlipidaemia, overall well-being, treatment satisfaction and quality of life. Safety was evaluated using physical and laboratory investigations and assessment of incidence of adverse events, including, in many of the studies reviewed, specific evaluation of those events known to be associated with antidiabetic treatment, hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Strong evidence was provided for better glycaemic control with BIAsp 30 without increases in the incidence of major hypoglycaemia or nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. Overall, weight gain with BIAsp 30 was minimal and not significantly greater than with basal insulin or BHI 30. Thus, we can confirm that the reported efficacy and tolerability of BIAsp 30 in the treatment of diabetes based on a variety of clinical endpoints is supported by a good body of evidence relating to its use in different dosage regimens and in comparison with other insulin treatment regimens.

25595417|t|High-dose atorvastatin is superior to moderate-dose simvastatin in preventing peripheral arterial disease.
25595417|a|OBJECTIVES: To study whether high-dose versus usual-dose statin treatment reduces the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and what is the effect of high-dose statin treatment on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome in patients with PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial, 8888 post-myocardial infarction patients were randomised to high-dose or usual-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 80  mg/day vs simvastatin 20-40  mg/day). We investigated the effect of high-dose versus usual-dose statins on the pre-specified outcome PAD incidence, and additionally performed a posthoc analysis of the efficacy of high-dose statins in reducing CVD risk among patients with PAD. During a median follow-up of 4.8  years, 94 patients (2.2%) receiving atorvastatin and 135 patients (3.2%) receiving simvastatin developed PAD (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.91; p=0.007). The risk of major coronary events was almost twofold higher in patients with PAD at baseline, but was no longer significant after adjusting for the adverse cardiovascular risk profile. In PAD patients, major coronary events occurred in fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (14.4%) than in the simvastatin group (20.1%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. (HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.11; p=0.13). Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced overall cardiovascular (p=0.046) and coronary events (p=0.004), and coronary revascularisation (p=0.007) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of PAD compared with usual-dose statin therapy with simvastatin. Patients with a history of PAD at baseline were at higher risk of future coronary events and this risk was reduced by high-dose atorvastatin treatment.

25474427|t|Does rectal indomethacin given for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis increase bleeding after biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy or cardiovascular mortality?: Post hoc analysis using prospective clinical trial data.
25474427|a|Rectal indomethacin has been proven to be effective for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) but its impact on bleeding after biliary sphincterotomy (BABES) and cardiovascular mortality has not been extensively studied. We aimed to assess the effect of indomethacin on the rate of BABES and short-term cardiovascular mortality, particularly in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy (APT).In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study, 100mg indomethacin or placebo was given within 1 hour before biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy to in-patients including those who are receiving APT (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] and/or clopidogrel). Cardiovascular mortality and BABES were observed for 30 days.Of 576 randomized patients (289 indomethacin, 287 placebo), 87 patients used 100mg/day ASA and 29 patients took 75mg/day clopidogrel, among them 5 patients were on dual APT. The ASA and clopidogrel taking patients were older than patients without APT (P<0.001), but these groups were similar in other parameters. BABES occurred similarly in different subgroups: indomethacin (8.0%) vs placebo (9.4%) (P=0.56), ASA (10.3%) vs non-ASA (8.4%) (P=0.54), clopidogrel (6.9%) vs nonclopidogrel (8.8%) (P>0.99). No BABES was observed among patients on dual APT. There was no difference in cardiovascular mortality between subgroups (P>0.99).Results indicate that single dose of 100mg indomethacin does not increase BABES rate and cardiovascular mortality. This result is independent from administering antiplatelet agents.

9825088|t|Management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.
9825088|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the occurrence and management of sexual dysfunction induced by selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to provide an overview of sexual dysfunction, reports of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, and management strategies. DATA SOURCES: Information was retrieved from a MEDLINE English-literature search from January 1986 to July 1998 and by review of references. Indexing terms included sexual dysfunction, antidepressants, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, clomipramine, buspirone, nefazodone, bupropion, cyproheptadine, amantadine, yohimbine, and central nervous system stimulants. STUDY SELECTION: There are no controlled studies describing SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction or its management. Twenty-one studies are presented, including 2 open-label studies, 12 case series, and 7 case reports. SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction is described with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine for 3-24 weeks of therapy. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were organized according to the pharmacologic agent used in the management of SSRI dysfunction, target population, SSRI implicated, type of sexual dysfunction, experimental design, and treatment response. Data were extracted from methodology and results sections of reports. Methodologic flaws included failure to account for gender differences, omission of SSRI dose and duration, and use of concomitant drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of reports suggests that SSRI-induced dysfunction is a common adverse effect; controlled studies are necessary to determine prevalence. Most reports have occurred with fluoxetine, but this phenomenon may be related to its widespread use. Further study is needed to evaluate baseline sexual function, to define target populations, and to compare SSRIs in inducing sexual dysfunction. Serotonin antagonists and dopamine agonists have been used most often to treat SSRI-induced dysfunction and have generally been effective, but controlled studies are also needed.

9759691|t|Microalbuminuria in nondiabetic adults: relation of blood pressure, body mass index, plasma cholesterol levels, and smoking: The Gubbio Population Study.
9759691|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence exists that cardiovascular risk factors influence progression toward end-stage renal failure. We tested the hypothesis that in nondiabetic middle-aged adults without macroalbuminuria, cardiovascular risk factors are related to urinary albumin excretion and prevalence of microalbuminuria, a sign of early nephropathy. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data for 1567 participants in The Gubbio Population Study (677 men and 890 women), aged 45 to 64 years, without macroalbuminuria, without diabetes mellitus, and with fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/ dL). Data collection included albumin and creatinine excretion in timed overnight urine collection; levels of fasting plasma cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, creatinine, and uric acid; creatinine clearance; red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport; blood pressure; weight; height; medical history; smoking status; and alcohol intake. Urinary albumin excretion and prevalence of microalbuminuria were the dependent variables. RESULTS: Blood pressure, plasma cholesterol levels, smoking, and body mass index significantly related to urinary albumin excretion and prevalence of microalbuminuria. In analyses with control for multiple variables, relative risk for microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion, 20-199 microg/min) in men and women was 2.51 and 1.62, respectively, with 18 mm Hg higher (1 SD) systolic blood pressure; 2.25 and 2.10, respectively, with 1.0-mmol/L (40 mg/dL) higher plasma cholesterol level; 1.99 and 1.91, respectively, for smokers vs nonsmokers; and 1.83 and 1.33, respectively, with 4 kg/m2 higher body mass index. Findings were similar for microalbuminuria defined as urinary albumin excretion of at least 25 microg/dL glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSION: Major cardiovascular risk factors are independent correlates of microalbuminuria in nondiabetic middle-aged adults.

10632046|t|Synthesis and anti-HIV evaluation of 2',3'-dideoxy imidazo- and nu-triazolo[4,5-d]pyridazine nucleosides.
10632046|a|The syntheses of the 2'-deoxy and 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides of 2,8-diaza-3-deazainosine and the 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside of 2-aza-3-deazainosine were achieved and the pathways leading to these novel nucleosides are described. The preparation of the 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside (1) of 2-aza-3-deazainosine involved deoxygenation of the 2'-deoxy-3'-imidazolide intermediate with n-Bu3SnH and AlBN. The latter nucleoside was synthesized from the known 2'-deoxy derivative of 2-aza-3-deazainosine. The three-step synthesis of 1 from the 2'-deoxy analogue was accomplished in 40% overall yield. Rather than synthesize the corresponding 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside (2) of 2,8-diaza-3-deazainosine in the same manner, i.e. deoxygenation of the 2'-deoxynucleoside, a more cost-effective route was chosen. This pathway involved reductive cleavage of the 5'-protected, 2',3'-thiocarbonate derivative to furnish a mixture of the 2'- and 3'-deoxy isomers. This mixture was not separated, but was deoxygenated by the aforementioned imidazolide method. Using this methodology, 2 was prepared in 23% overall yield from 2,8-diaza-3-deazainosine. Nucleosides 1 and 2 were evaluated for antiretroviral activity and were found to be inactive.

18706338|t|Determination of selected phenothiazines in human plasma by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with coulometric detection.
18706338|a|A new analytical method, based on liquid chromatography with coulometric detection, has been developed and applied to the determination of selected phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, promazine, fluphenazine and levomepromazine) in human plasma. The drugs were separated on a Discovery pentafluorophenylpropyl column, using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile (32%) and a pH 1.9 phosphate buffer (68%). Promethazine was used as the internal standard. Detection was carried out at an oxidation potential of +0.500 V. A novel clean-up procedure was developed by means of solid-phase extraction, using cyanopropyl cartridges, which gave good extraction yield for all the analytes, with absolute recovery values higher than 91.0%. The detector response was linear over a plasma concentration range of 0.5-250.0 ng mL(-1) for chlorpromazine, promazine and levomepromazine and of 0.2-4.0 ng mL(-1) for fluphenazine. Precision results, expressed by the intra-day and the inter-day relative standard deviation values, were good, being lower than 3.9%. Accuracy data were satisfactory as well. The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of drug plasma levels of psychiatric patients undergoing therapy with selected phenothiazines.

16189445|t|Metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after the completion of chemotherapy.
16189445|a|The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of potent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. To provide information on the late complications of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the authors prospectively studied the frequency of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in survivors of ALL in the initial years after the completion of therapy. Children and adolescents were classified as having the metabolic syndrome if they met three or more of the following criteria: hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high fasting glucose, obesity, and hypertension. Obesity was defined on the basis of Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) standard deviation scores or z-scores. Cutoff points for triglycerides and HDL were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles with the cutoff points proposed by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII). Hyperglycemia was defined using the ATPIII cutoff points. Elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure was defined as a value greater than the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Fifty-two subjects (29 male and 23 female) with a median age of 15.2 years (range 6.1-22.6 years) were evaluated. Median interval since completion of therapy was 37 months (range 13-121 months). All of them had been treated according to the ALL-BFM 90 chemotherapy protocol and none had received cranial radiotherapy. Of the 52 subjects, 25 (48%) were overweight (BMI z-score >1.5) and 3 (5.76%) were obese (BMI z-score >2); among them, 1 was severely obese (BMI z-score >2.5). Three criteria for the metabolic syndrome (high triglyceride levels, glucose intolerance, and obesity) were fulfilled by three subjects (5.76%). Twenty-nine subjects (55.7%) had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Hyperglycemia and hypertension were infrequent. Prompt recognition of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and intervention seem mandatory to ensure early prevention of cardiovascular disease in survivors of ALL.

12040465|t|T cell transduction and suicide with an enhanced mutant thymidine kinase.
12040465|a|Retroviral transfer of Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase to T cells has been used to confer sensitivity to the antiviral agent ganciclovir. This has allowed therapeutic approaches to be developed in which T cells mediating graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation can be selectively eliminated by the administration of ganciclovir. Although the strategy has been shown to be generally successful in early clinical trials, there are concerns about possible resistance to ganciclovir and the risk of myelosuppressive side-effects at the doses required to induce T cell suicide. We have incorporated the enhanced mutant HSV-TKSR39 into retroviral vectors tailored to exhibit high levels of expression in T cells and have used protocols optimized for the transduction and selection of primary lymphocytes. We demonstrate that leukemic and primary T cells can be efficiently transduced and highly enriched under conditions that should be readily adaptable for clinical use. T cells carrying HSV-TKSR39 were inhibited by exposure to ganciclovir at concentrations an order of magnitude below those required for wild-type HSV-TK. The less toxic agent aciclovir also eliminated T cells transduced with HSV-TKSR39 (but not HSV-TK), underlining the increased therapeutic potential of the mutant suicide gene system in the bone marrow transplantation setting.

23638710|t|De novo hepatitis B virus infection from anti-HBc-positive donors in pediatric living donor liver transplantation.
23638710|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factors of de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection from hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)-positive donors in pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 46 recipients without pre-liver transplantation (LT) HBV infection evidence who underwent LDLT from October 2006 to May 2011 in our center. HBV markers, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs), anti-HBc, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody (anti-HBe) were determined in both donors and recipients before LT and in recipients after LT. HBV DNA titer was measured if the recipients were strongly suspected of de novo HBV infection. RESULTS: Without prophylaxis, de novo HBV infection occurred in 11 of 46 recipients (23.9%) 6-36 months after LT. All 11 patients received grafts from anti-HBc-positive donors. The donors' baseline status and the characteristics of recipients at the time of transplantation were not associated with the acquisition of de novo hepatitis B infection. The overall 2-year survival rate of patients from anti-HBc-positive donors was 84.2%. Two de novo HBV-infected patients who had YMDD mutation were given adefovir combined with lamivudine, and their liver function gradually improved during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HBc-positive donors can significantly increase the incidence of de novo HBV infection in HBsAg-negative recipients. Administration with adefovir in patients who are resistant to lamivudine seems to be an effective and safe way for de novo HBV infection.

18006696|t|SYK-dependent tonic B-cell receptor signaling is a rational treatment target in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
18006696|a|The role of B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated survival signals in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains undefined. Ligand-induced BCR signaling induces receptor oligomerization, Igalpha/beta immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) phosphorylation, and activation of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which initiates downstream events and amplifies the initial BCR signal. BCRs also transmit low-level tonic survival signals in the absence of receptor engagement. Herein, we assess the role of SYK-dependent tonic BCR survival signals in DLBCL cell lines and primary tumors and evaluate the efficacy of an ATP-competitive inhibitor of SYK, R406, in vitro. R406 induced apoptosis of the majority of examined DLBCL cell lines. In R406-sensitive DLBCL cell lines, R406 specifically inhibited both tonic- and ligand-induced BCR signaling (autophosphorylation of SYK525/526 and SYK-dependent phosphorylation of the B-cell linker protein [BLNK]). The majority of examined primary DLBCLs also exhibited tonic- and ligand-induced BCR signaling; in these primary tumors, BCR signaling was also inhibited by R406. Of note, BCR-dependent and R406-sensitive DLBCL cell lines were independently identified as "BCR-type" tumors by transcriptional profiling. Therefore, SYK-dependent tonic BCR signaling is an important and potentially targetable survival pathway in some, but not all, DLBCLs. In addition, R406-sensitive DLBCLs can be identified by their transcriptional profiles.

17187467|t|XIENCE V everolimus-eluting coronary stent system: a novel second generation drug-eluting stent.
17187467|a|Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been shown to be safe and significantly reduce clinical events and angiographic restenosis in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease. Currently, three DES have been approved in Europe and Northern America: the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES), the paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) and the zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES). Everolimus, an analog of sirolimus, is an immunosuppressive and antiproliferative agent. In three studies, the SPIRIT I, FUTURE I and II, the everolimus-eluting stent has proven to be safe, well-tolerated and has shown very favorable clinical and angiographic results. Compared with earlier-generation DES, the XIENCE V everolimus-eluting coronary stent system (Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc., an Abbott Vascular Company, CA, USA) may provide enhanced deliverability, radiopacity with thinner strut filaments and, owing to a durable polymer, sustained drug elution and vascular compatibility.

20515944|t|Bortezomib sensitizes human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.
20515944|a|Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers, and novel treatment modalities are required. We investigated the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) on human ESCC cell lines. Bortezomib enhanced the susceptibility to TRAIL in 12 of the 15 ESCC cell lines tested, although most showed low sensitivity to TRAIL as a single agent. The enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib was caspase dependent. Increased processing of caspase-8 often accompanied enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by bortezomib. However, the increased cell surface expression of death receptors observed on bortezomib treatment did not seem to be crucial for this effect. For some ESCC, bortezomib treatment resulted in a more efficient recruitment of caspase-8 and the Fas-associated death domain to the death-inducing signaling complex. Additional downregulation of the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein long isoform [c-FLIP(L)] could cooperate in the activation of the extrinsic pathway in some cases. For other ESCC, the crucial effect of bortezomib treatment seemed to be increased signaling via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway on subsequent exposure to TRAIL. Thus, bortezomib could sensitize ESCC to TRAIL apoptosis by multiple molecular mechanisms of action. Therefore, the combination of bortezomib and TRAIL might be a novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC patients who fail to respond to standard chemoradiotherapy that predominantly targets the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

22540432|t|Clinical differences between opioid abuse classes ameliorated after 1 year of buprenorphine-medication assisted treatment.
22540432|a|This study compared the clinical and demographic profiles of three opioid-dependent user groups, and measured their response to 1 year of buprenorphine-medication assisted treatment. Opioid prescription, street, and combination (street + prescription) users completed the Addiction Severity Index multiple times over the course of one treatment year. Although groups differed on all measured demographics (P values <.05) and on six of seven Addiction Severity Index composite scores at induction (P values <.05), differences were ameliorated after 1 year. Findings highlight the disparities between the various opioid-dependent patient subpopulations and suggest that buprenorphine-medication assisted treatment is an effective treatment across user subtypes.

12204511|t|Long-term intravenous epoprostenol infusion in primary pulmonary hypertension: prognostic factors and survival.
12204511|a|OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the factors associated with long-term survival in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) treated with continuous epoprostenol infusion. BACKGROUND: Epoprostenol improves survival in patients with PPH in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV. However, some patients do not benefit from epoprostenol and must be considered for lung transplantation. The best timing for listing these patients on a lung transplantation program is currently unknown. METHODS: Between December 1992 and January 2001, 178 patients with PPH in NYHA functional class III or IV were treated with epoprostenol. The 6-min walk test (WT) and right-sided heart catheterization were performed at baseline, after three months on epoprostenol and thereafter once a year. RESULTS: Overall survival rates at one, two, three, and five years were 85%, 70%, 63%, and 55%, respectively. On univariate analysis, the baseline variables associated with a poor outcome were a history of right-sided heart failure, NYHA functional class IV, 6-min WT <or=250 m (median value), right atrial pressure >or=12 mm Hg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure <65 mm Hg. On multivariate analysis, including both baseline variables and those measured after three months on epoprostenol, a history of right-sided heart failure, persistence of NYHA functional class III or IV at three months, and the absence of a fall in total pulmonary resistance of >30%, relative to baseline, were associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with PPH treated with epoprostenol depends on the severity at baseline, as well as the three-month response to therapy. These findings suggest that lung transplantation should be considered in a subset of patients who remain in NYHA functional class III or IV or in those who cannot achieve a significant hemodynamic improvement after three months of epoprostenol therapy, or both.

7496051|t|Newer antihypertensive drugs.
7496051|a|We review three new classes of antihypertensive drugs: imidazolines, monatepil, and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. Imidazolines are a new generation of central acting drugs. Because of their greater affinity for imidazoline receptors rather than alpha 2-adrenoreceptors, they cause less fatigue and dry mouth than the older central acting drugs. Monatepil is a single drug with both calcium antagonist and peripheral alpha 1-antagonist properties. This agent not only lowers blood pressure but also lowers serum cholesterol, an effect mediated by its alpha-antagonism, and has anti-lipid peroxidation properties. Monatepil might become an effective antiatherosclerosis drug. Neutral endopeptidase inhibitors lower blood pressure by inhibiting the metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide and other vasoactive peptides.

1770324|t|Effect of buflomedil, dipyridamole and indobufene on hemorrheologic and blood coagulation parameters in patients who underwent vascular surgery for severe atherosclerosis.
1770324|a|We studied 30 patients (age range 58 to 64 years) who underwent vascular surgery for peripheral vascular disease (24 patients) and for carotid stenosis (6 patients). At the time of the study, all subjects have been taking antiplatelet agents for at least three months. They were divided into three groups of ten patients each: the first group received buflomedil (BUF), the second dipyridamole (DIP) and the third indobufene (IND), as treatment before vascular surgery. We investigated the influence of these drugs on hemorrheologic (hematocrit, whole blood and plasma viscosity) and blood coagulation (partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and bleeding time) parameters in all patients. In our experience, none of the three drugs influenced any tested parameters, which were within normal limits: among them we noted only a statistically significant difference in bleeding time between patients treated with BUF and IND.

7631765|t|Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide: occurrence and relaxant effect in female genital tract.
7631765|a|The distribution, localization, and smooth muscle effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) were studied in the human female genital tract. The concentrations of PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 were measured by radioimmunoassays, and both peptides were found throughout the genital tract. The highest concentrations of PACAP-38 were detected in the ovary, the upper part of vagina, and the perineum. The concentrations of PACAP-27 were generally low, in some regions below the detection limit and in other regions 1 to 5% of the PACAP-38 concentrations. Immunocytochemistry revealed that PACAP was located in delicate varicose nerve fibers that were most abundant in the internal cervical os, where they mainly seemed to innervate blood vessels and smooth muscle cells. PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 (10(-10)-10(-6) M) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the spontaneous activity of the nonvascular smooth muscle strips from fallopian tube and myometrium in vitro. Likewise, both peptides (10(-10)-10(-6) M) caused relaxation of nonrepinephrine (10(-6) M)-precontracted intramyometrial arteries. No effect of the PACAP sequences, PACAP-(6-27), PACAP-(16-38), and PACAP-(18-27), on fallopian tube was observed. The findings suggest a smooth muscle regulatory role of PACAP in the human female reproductive tract.

15805000|t|Amantadine in chronic granulomatous disease.
15805000|a|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetically determined immunodeficiency. Neutrophils from CGD patients show a defective killing of phagocytosed fungi and bacteria, due not only to an impairment in oxidative burst, but also to absence of normal pH value within phagocytic vacuole following phagocytosis. Because a weak base such as amantadine could potentially reverse these pH abnormalities, the authors used this drug to treat 2 CGD patients. They observed modifications of both phagosomal pH and killing activity on their neutrophils compared to those of healthy controls. Since the drug has been employed, the patients have not developed new infections, suggesting a role of amantadine as a part of CGD prophylactic regimen. These results suggest the opportunity of testing the drug in larger studies.

22933166|t|Hypothyroidism during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
22933166|a|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are relatively new targeted therapy drugs used for the treatment of metastatic clear cell kidney carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, thyroid carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours during the progression of the disease. Hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction is often a side effect of this treatment. Therefore, monitoring of thyroid hormone levels before the beginning and during the treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a necessity. Hypothyroidism correlates with objective response to the treatment. Sunitinib. This is the most described tyrosine kinase inhibitor which causes hypothyroidism. The mechanism of hypothyroidism is still unclear. Sorafenib. Symptoms of hypothyroidism occur in 18% of patients treated with sorafenib due to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Imatinib. Hypothyroidism is one of the most frequent side effects of the treatment. Emergent tracheotomy was necessary due to larynx swelling during marked hypothyroidism. Motesanib. Hypothyroidism or increased TSH level is diagnosed in 22% to 69% of patients with metastatic differentiated or medullary thyroid carcinomas. The management of patients with thyroid dysfunction and related symptoms such as fatigue is undoubtedly a challenge to an oncologist.

18327024|t|Encephalitis and catatonia treated with ECT.
18327024|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 cases of encephalitis with neuropsychiatric symptoms including catatonia, compounded by neuroleptic use for delirious agitation culminating in malignant catatonia responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms including catatonia can be manifestations of limbic encephalitis and encephalitides of unidentified etiology, including encephalitis lethargica. Catatonic features are often difficult to appraise in this context. This can easily lead to the use of neuroleptics, which may precipitate worsening of catatonia. METHOD: Medical, neurologic, and psychiatric histories, physical examination findings, results of laboratory, imaging and neurophysiologic investigations, and treatment response with medications and ECT were recorded. RESULTS: Both patients showed significant improvement with ECT. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant catatonia can complicate encephalitis lethargica and idiopathic limbic encephalitis, which already carry high mortality rates. When neuroleptics are used for agitation in cases of encephalitis, physicians must be wary of precipitating malignant catatonia and neuroleptics should be discontinued when such a danger emerges. Although lorazepam is helpful in treating catatonia, it may not suffice, as in the cases presented. ECT deserves serious consideration early in the course of malignant catatonia and for catatonia nested in encephalopathy secondary to encephalitis, unresolved with lorazepam.

1986570|t|Effect of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension.
1986570|a|The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension. A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks. Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine. Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated. Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered. The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg). Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG. This Ca-entry blocker worked to normalize intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension by dilating afferent arterioles alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

17178792|t|Impact of nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentration on selection of resistant virus in mothers who received single-dose NVP to prevent perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission and persistence of resistant virus in their infected children.
17178792|a|Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance following the use of single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) remains a concern. In the ANRS-1201/1202 Ditrame study, conducted in Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, a short-course regimen of zidovudine was associated with sdNVP for PMTCT. In this study, we estimate the frequency of NVP resistance and its relationship with NVP concentration in mothers. Genotypic resistance analysis was performed on mothers' plasma samples at week 4 postpartum (PP) and on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) when an NVP resistance mutation was detected. The same tests were performed for the infected children at week 4, month 3, and month 12. Mothers' NVP plasma concentrations were measured at 48 h PP. Twenty-one (33%) of the 63 women selected had NVP-resistant (NVP-R) virus at week 4 PP. The median plasma NVP concentration was 598 ng/ml for the mothers without NVP-R virus compared to 851 ng/ml for the mothers harboring NVP-R virus (P = 0.014). NVP-R mutations were detected in the HIV DNA of 15/20 women. Plasma NVP-R mutations were detectable in 6 of 26 infected children at week 4. All 6 children had detectable NVP-R mutations in HIV DNA of PBMC. Blood samples taken at month 3 (1 child) and month 12 (1 child) revealed the persistence of NVP-R mutations in plasma and cells. Emergence of NVP-R virus in mothers is strongly correlated with a high level of plasma NVP concentration, owing to a prolonged postpartum period of viral replication under NVP selective pressure. The follow-up of the cohort demonstrates the prolonged archive of resistant virus.

7726994|t|Vorozole, a specific non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor.
7726994|a|Vorozole, the (+)-(S)-isomer of a new triazole compound, is a potent and selective aromatase inhibitor. In vitro, the compound is over a thousandfold more active than aminoglutethimide. In vivo, the compound very potently inhibits ovarian, peripheral, and tumoral aromatase. Vorozole shows an in vitro selectivity margin of 10,000-fold for aromatase inhibition as compared to inhibition of other P450- and non-P450-dependent reactions. This selectivity was confirmed in the rat in vivo. Vorozole, like ovariectomy, almost completely reduces tumor growth in the DMBA-induced mammary carcinoma model in the rat. In postmenopausal women, vorozole very potently inhibits peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone. After chronic administration, plasma estradiol levels are reduced while the levels of adrenal gluco- and mineralo-corticoids remain unchanged. Vorozole has excellent oral bioavailability and exerts linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.

8474940|t|Developing drug use evaluation criteria for parenteral fluoroquinolones.
8474940|a|The basic tenet of pharmaceutical care asserts that the delivery of optimal, cost-effective pharmacotherapy can be best achieved by identifying, resolving, and preventing drug-related problems. Drug use evaluation (DUE) is one of the primary tools used to achieve these ends. Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials meet Joint Commission criteria for targeting for DUE: the drugs are used in populations at high risk for adverse drug reactions, quality assurance or infection control committees target them for DUE, the drugs are costly, they may be suspected or known to be used inappropriately, and they are prescribed frequently. Outside this supplement, no published DUE criteria for parenteral fluoroquinolones currently exist. Suggested criteria include use in patients who would otherwise be candidates for oral fluoroquinolone therapy (for which published criteria exist) but who cannot use the oral route of administration due to gastrointestinal conditions predisposing to malabsorption or unavailability of the oral route; for severe infections due to gram-negative pathogens; as a replacement for aminoglycosides when ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity is a substantial risk; targeting to resistant pathogens (i.e., not as empiric therapy); and targeting to therapeutic use only (not for prophylaxis). The DUE process is crucial for ensuring safe, effective, appropriate, and economical drug therapy. It is an effective mechanism for evaluating the use of new agents and as an educational tool for clinicians in the postmarketing period.

22122192|t|Biological characterization of a novel class of toll-like receptor 7 agonists designed to have reduced systemic activity.
22122192|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists have potential in the treatment of allergic diseases. However, the therapeutic utility of current low molecular weight TLR7 agonists is limited by their systemic activity, resulting in unwanted side effects. We have developed a series of TLR7-selective 'antedrugs', including SM-324405 and AZ12441970, which contain an ester group rapidly cleaved in plasma to reduce systemic exposure. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Agonist activity at TLR7 of the parent ester and acid metabolite was assessed in vitro in reporter cells and primary cells from a number of species. Pharmacokinetics following a dose to the lungs was assessed in mice and efficacy evaluated in vivo with a mouse allergic airway model. KEY RESULTS Compounds were selective agonists for TLR7 with no crossover to TLR8 and were metabolically unstable in plasma with the acid metabolite showing substantially reduced activity in a number of assays. The compounds inhibited IL-5 production and induced IFN-a, which mediated the inhibition of IL-5. When dosed into the lung the compounds were rapidly metabolized and short-term exposure of the 'antedrug' was sufficient to activate the IFN pathway. AZ12441970 showed efficacy in a mouse allergic airway model with minimal induction of systemic IFN-a, consistent with the low plasma levels of compound. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The biological and metabolic profiles of these TLR7-selective agonist 'antedrug' compounds are consistent with a new class of compound that could be administered locally for the treatment of allergic diseases, while reducing the risk of systemic side effects.

21804481|t|The proinflammatory mediator's production from ischemic brain during carotid endarterectomy.
21804481|a|AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the quantity of produced mediators of inflammation (cytokines and eicosanoids), during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), which are factors of ischemic damage of the brain. METHODS: Two groups (A and B) of 15 patients each, with internal carotid backpressure >30 mmHg were operated in our institution. We did not use a shunt in Group A during CEA and group B was operated upon with a shunt. Plasma concentrations of Interleukin-1b (IL-1b), Thromboxane B2 (TXB2), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. RESULTS: We measured gradual increase of levels of IL-1b and TXB2 during cross-clamping and during reperfusion in group A (P<0.05). The levels of TNFa increased only during reperfusion (P<0.05). The concentration of IL-1b and TNFa remained almost stable in group B, whereas the concentration of TXB2 reduced but not significantly (P>0.05). The levels of PGE2 remained stable in both groups. CONCLUSION: We should consider the increase of proinflammatory mediators during carotid cross-clamping when no shunt is used. The critical concentration of these mediators that threaten the brain's vitality is not yet detected. However, the clinical significance of this is unclear, since there were no perioperative strokes.

17275994|t|Estrogen receptor alpha regulates expression of the breast cancer 1 associated ring domain 1 (BARD1) gene through intronic DNA sequence.
17275994|a|We have used a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based cloning strategy to isolate and identify genes associated with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. One of the gene regions isolated was a 288bp fragment from the ninth intron of the breast cancer 1 associated ring domain (BARD1) gene. We demonstrated that ERalpha associated with this region of the endogenous BARD 1 gene in MCF-7 cells, that ERalpha bound to three of five ERE half sites located in the 288bp BARD1 region, and that this 288bp BARD1 region conferred estrogen responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Importantly, treatment of MCF-7 cells with estrogen increased BARD1 mRNA and protein levels. These findings demonstrate that ChIP cloning strategies can be utilized to successfully isolate regulatory regions that are far removed from the transcription start site and assist in identifying cis elements involved in conferring estrogen responsiveness.

18843273|t|Obesity, low testosterone levels and erectile dysfunction.
18843273|a|Obesity is an important risk factor for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, cancer and erectile dysfunction (ED). Adipose tissues produce a number of adipokines and cytokines, which affect endothelial and metabolic function resulting in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (risks factors for CVD). Both ED and metabolic syndrome improve with a reduction in body mass index (BMI). The relationships among obesity, metabolic syndrome, ED, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum total and free testosterone levels are complex and often confusing to the physician. It is known that BMI is inversely proportional to serum total testosterone concentrations; low serum SHBG levels in obesity contribute to the low serum total testosterone. Recent studies show that BMI is also inversely proportional to free testosterone concentration. The characteristic low serum testosterone concentrations observed in obese men are also present in men with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small proportion of men with ED have hypogonadism; however, the proportion increases if these men are obese with manifestations of the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. ED is a common symptom in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have low testosterone levels. This review describes the relationships between low serum testosterone concentrations and ED in obese patients and those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

24226057|t|Tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in A5221 STRIDE: timing, severity, and implications for HIV-TB programs.
24226057|a|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-tuberculosis (TB) is associated with increased immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The severity, frequency, and complications of TB IRIS were evaluated in A5221, a randomized trial of earlier ART (within 2 weeks after TB treatment initiation) vs. later ART (8-12 weeks after TB treatment) in HIV-infected patients starting TB treatment. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: In 806 participants, TB IRIS was defined using published clinical criteria. Cases were classified as severe (hospitalization/death), moderate (corticosteroid use/invasive procedure), or mild (no hospitalization/procedures/steroids). Fisher exact, Wilcoxon, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons. MAIN RESULTS: TB IRIS occurred in 61 (7.6%) patients: 10.4% in earlier vs. 4.7% in later ART, 11.5% with CD4 <50 vs. 5.4% with CD4 >= 50 cells per cubic millimeter. The CD4/ART arm interaction was significant, P = 0.014, with 44.3% of TB IRIS occurring with CD4 <50 and earlier ART. TB IRIS occurred sooner with earlier vs. later ART initiation, at a median of 29 vs. 82 days after TB treatment initiation (P < 0.001). IRIS manifestations included lymphadenopathy (59.0%), constitutional symptoms (54.1%), and radiographic changes (41.0%); central nervous system TB IRIS was uncommon (6.6%). TB IRIS was mild in 27.9%, moderate in 41.0%, and severe in 31.1%. No TB IRIS-associated deaths occurred. IRIS management required >= 1 invasive procedures in 34.4%, hospitalization in 31.1%, and corticosteroids in 54.1%. CONCLUSIONS: TB IRIS was more frequent with earlier ART initiation and CD4 <50 cells per cubic millimeter. As ART is implemented earlier in HIV-TB coinfection, programs will require the diagnostic capabilities, clinical resources, and training necessary to manage TB IRIS.

18089691|t|Vitamin D2 is as effective as vitamin D3 in maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
18089691|a|CONTEXT: Two reports suggested that vitamin D2 is less effective than vitamin D3 in maintaining vitamin D status. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or increased the catabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of healthy adults ages 18-84 yr who received placebo, 1000 IU vitamin D3, 1000 IU vitamin D2, or 500 IU vitamin D2 plus 500 IU vitamin D3 daily for 11 wk at the end of the winter. RESULTS: Sixty percent of the healthy adults were vitamin D deficient at the start of the study. The circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean+/-sd) increased to the same extent in the groups that received 1000 IU daily as vitamin D2 (baseline 16.9+/-10.5 ng/ml; 11 wk 26.8+/-9.6 ng/ml), vitamin D3 (baseline 19.6+/-11.1 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.9+/-11.0 ng/ml), or a combination of 500 IU vitamin D2 and 500 IU vitamin D3 (baseline 20.2+/-10.4 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.4+/-7.7 ng/ml). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels did not change in the group that received 1000 IU vitamin D2 daily. The 1000 IU dose of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 did not raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in vitamin D-deficient subjects above 30 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: A 1000 IU dose of vitamin D2 daily was as effective as 1000 IU vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and did not negatively influence serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Therefore, vitamin D2 is equally as effective as vitamin D3 in maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D status.

11243246|t|Influence of ascorbic acid on cytotoxic activity of copper and iron ions in vitro.
11243246|a|We investigated survival of two kinds of human embryonic cells (CLV102, Lu106) and human melanoma cells (Mel8) exposed to exogenous iron and copper ions in the absence or in the presence of ascorbic acid, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Iron ions produced cytotoxicity towards both kinds of cells dependent on its concentration. Catalase suppressed the cytotoxicity induced by iron ions in Lu106 cells. whereas in CLV102 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. By contrast, superoxide dismutase abolished the cytotoxicity of iron ions towards CLV102 cells, whereas in Lu106 and Mel8 cells, was ineffective. The mixture of iron ions with ascorbic acid was less cytotoxic than iron ions themselves or ascorbic acid itself, only in CLV102 and Lu106 cells. Ascorbic acid enhanced drastically cytotoxic effect of copper ions in all kinds of cells.

9829022|t|Role of serotonin in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
9829022|a|BACKGROUND: Serotonin may play a role in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) because of the anti-obsessional effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). METHOD: The literature is reviewed on knowledge of the role of serotonergic neurons in brain function, studies on monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), various stress neuropeptides, neuroendocrine and behavioural challenge after administration of direct and indirect serotomimetic compounds, and neuroanatomical data on brain circuits organising behaviour. RESULTS: In most of the OCD cases analysed, CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations do not significantly differ from age-corrected controls. However, a relationship appears to exist between pre-treatment levels of these metabolites and clinical response to drugs acting on the serotonin transporter. Abnormalities in CSF arginine vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, oxytocin and somatostatin levels have been reported in OCD. Long-term treatment with high-doses of clomipramine, fluvoxamine, and fluoxetine tend to correct these neuropeptide abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesise that continuous treatment with SSRIs alters serotonin turnover and neuropeptide expression patterns in OCD-entertaining functional forebrain/midbrain circuits.

15578945|t|Chiral inversion of drugs: coincidence or principle?
15578945|a|2-arylpropionic acid derivatives are probably the most frequently cited drugs exhibiting the phenomenon that is best known as chiral inversion. One enantiomer of drug is converted into its antipode either in the presence of a solvent or more often in inner environment of an organism. Mechanistic studies of the metabolic chiral inversion were carried out for several drugs from NSAIDs, and a model of this inversion was suggested and subsequently confirmed. The chiral inversion of NSAIDs has been intensively studied in the context of the pharmacological and toxicological consequences. However, the group of NSAIDs is not the sole group of drugs in which the inversion phenomenon can be observed. There exist several other drugs that also display chiral inversion of one or even both of their enantiomers. These drugs belong to different pharmacotherapeutic groups as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antiepileptic drugs, drugs used in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia or drugs that are effective in the treatment of leprosy. Moreover, some chiral or prochiral drugs are metabolized to give chiral metabolites that undergo chiral inversion too, which can have direct impact on pharmacological properties or toxicity of the drug. As the process of chiral inversion is affected by several factors, so the intensity of chiral inversion of individual substances and at different conditions can differ considerably. Interspecies differences and types of tissue are reported to be the main factors that were recognized to play the key role in the process of chiral inversion. Some of more recent studies have revealed that several other factors, such as the route of administration or interaction with other xenobiotics, can influence the enantiomeric conversion, too. Chiral inversion does not seem to be a phenomenon connected with only several drugs from some unique group of 2-arylpropionic acid derivatives: it is also observed in drugs with rather different chemical structures and is much more frequent than it can be realized.

25492214|t|Ras/ERK signaling pathway is involved in curcumin-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma AGS cells.
25492214|a|Curcumin, the biologically active compound from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of curcumin on gastric carcinoma cells still needs further investigation. In this study, morphological observation indicated that curcumin inhibited the proliferation of AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner. According to the flow cytometric analysis, curcumin treatment resulted in G2/M arrest in AGS cells, accompanied with an increased expression of cyclin B1 and a decreased expression of cyclin D1. In addition, DNA ladders were observed by gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were also enhanced in curcumin-treated AGS cells. Nevertheless, the increased activities could be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OME)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), which suggested that the apoptosis was caspase-dependent. Furthermore, downregulation of rat sarcoma (Ras) and upregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also observed in AGS cells treated with curcumin by Western blot. U0126, an ERK inhibitor, blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. The results suggested that curcumin inhibited the growth of the AGS cells and induced apoptosis through the activation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and downstream caspase cascade, and curcumin might be a potential target for the treatment of gastric carcinoma.

19184270|t|Glucocorticoid and cyclosporine refractory adult onset Still's disease successfully treated with tocilizumab.
19184270|a|We report a 29-year-old Japanese woman with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and adult onset Still's disease (AOSD). Her disease was refractory to high-dose glucocorticoids, two courses of steroid pulse therapy, and addition of cyclosporine (3.5 mg/kg/day). The serum interleukin-6 level was markedly elevated. Therefore, we administered an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab, 8 mg/kg fortnightly), which dramatically improved her symptoms and the levels of acute-phase proteins. In addition, rapid tapering of the glucocorticoid dose was possible. Four months later, she was maintained on tocilizumab infusion once a month with low-dose steroid therapy. Cyclosporine is one of the first-line immunosuppressants for AOSD, especially when associated with DIC, hepatic failure, or hemophagocytic syndrome. In patients with cyclosporine-resistant AOSD, tocilizumab may be another useful option.

19355831|t|The successful use of sorafenib to treat pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma.
19355831|a|BACKGROUND: Pediatric papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) typically presents with more advanced disease as compared with adults, yet the prognosis, even in the presence of distant metastatic disease, is usually excellent. Systemic therapies other than radioactive iodine (RAI) are rarely required. Sorafenib is an orally administered multi-kinase inhibitor that has shown promise in the treatment of adults with advanced thyroid cancer, but it has not yet been studied in children with this disease. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to present an adolescent with a progressive RAI-resistant PTC who was successfully treated with sorafenib. PATIENT AND INTERVENTION: A 14-year-old girl had progressive lung metastases from PTC despite previous therapies with almost 400 mCi (131)I. Sorafenib was initiated at a starting dose of 200 mg twice daily and decreased to a maintenance dose of 200 mg daily due to side effects that developed within 3 weeks of treatment. After 67 days on the lower dose, there was a dramatic improvement in the lung metastases. The patient was monitored while continuing thyrotropin-suppressive therapy only. Minimal regrowth of the pulmonary metastases was observed, and a second treatment course of sorafenib 200 mg every other day was equally successful in achieving a clinical response. Thyroglobulin autoantibodies declined over the course of therapy and observation. CONCLUSION: In the very rare case of the pediatric patient with progressive RAI-refractory PTC, for which no good systemic therapy exists, sorafenib may play an important role in the management of this disease.

19652659|t|Lactoferrin increases (172Thr)AMPK phosphorylation and insulin-induced (p473Ser)AKT while impairing adipocyte differentiation.
19652659|a|OBJECTIVE: Lactoferrin is a pleiotropic glycoprotein of the innate immune system with known effects on immunomodulation and cell differentiation. To gain an insight into the interaction among obesity, inflammation and insulin action, we aimed to examine the effects of lactoferrin on adipogenesis and the response to insulin in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and 3T3-L1 cell lines. DESIGN: The cells were cultured with increasing lactoferrin concentration under non-inflammatory, inflammatory and standard conditions. The response to insulin was evaluated through (473Ser)AKT phosphorylation. The effects of lactoferrin on adipogenesis were studied through the expression of different lipogenic markers, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, retinoblastoma (Rb) activity and Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 cells. RESULTS: Lactoferrin increased dose-dependent insulin-induced (473Ser)AKT phosphorylation in both cell lines. Inflammation-induced decreased (473Ser)AKT phosphorylation was also rescued by lactoferrin. In addition, lactoferrin led to increased (p172Thr)AMPK during 3T3-L1 differentiation and to decreased adipogenesis (as shown by decreased expression of fatty acid synthase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase-alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in parallel with decreased formation of lipid droplets). Lactoferrin also increased dose-dependent Rb activity (expression and hypophosphorylation) during 3T3-L1 differentiation. CONCLUSION: Lactoferrin administration increased insulin-induced (473Ser)AKT phosphorylation, even in those conditions wherein the response to insulin was downregulated, and led to blunted adipogenesis in the context of increased (p172Thr)AMPK and Rb activity.

15331636|t|Nitric oxide negatively regulates proliferation and promotes neuronal differentiation through N-Myc downregulation.
15331636|a|Nitric oxide (NO) has been found to act as an important negative regulator of cell proliferation in several systems. We report here that NO negatively regulates proliferation of neuronal cell precursors and promotes their differentiation by downregulating the oncogene N-Myc. We have studied this regulatory function of NO in neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-BE) and in primary cerebellar granule cell cultures. In a neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) overexpressing neuroblastoma cell line exposed to the differentiative action of retinoic acid, NO slowed down proliferation and accelerated differentiation towards a neuronal phenotype. This effect was accompanied by a parallel decrease of N-Myc expression. Similar results could be obtained in parental SK-N-BE cells by providing an exogenous source of NO. Pharmacological controls demonstrated that NO's regulatory actions on cell proliferation and N-Myc expression were mediated by cGMP as an intermediate messenger. Furthermore, NO was found to modulate the transcriptional activity of N-Myc gene promoter by acting on the E2F regulatory region, possibly through the control of Rb phosphorylation state, that we found to be negatively regulated by NO. In cerebellar granule cell cultures, NOS inhibition increased the division rate of neuronal precursors, in parallel with augmented N-Myc expression. Because a high N-Myc expression level is essential for neuroblastoma progression as well as for proliferation of neuronal precursors, its negative regulation by NO highlights a novel physiopathological function of this important messenger molecule.

16052472|t|Roles of Ca2+ and the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CASR) in the expression of inducible NOS (nitric oxide synthase)-2 and its BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin)-dependent activation in cytokine-stimulated adult human astrocytes.
16052472|a|Since NO production by NOS-2 made by astrocytes activated by proinflammatory cytokines contributes to the killing of neurons in variously damaged human brains, knowing the mechanisms responsible for NOS-2 expression should contribute to developing effective therapeutics. The expression and activation of NOS-2 in normal adult human cerebral cortical astrocytes treated with three proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma, are driven by two separable mechanisms. NOS-2 expression requires a burst of p38 MAPK activity, while the activation of the resulting enzyme protein requires MEK/ERK-dependent BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin) synthesis between 24 and 24.5 h after adding the cytokines to the culture medium. Here we show that NOS-2 expression in the activated astrocytes requires that the culture medium contain 1.8 mM Ca2+, but it is unaffected by inhibiting calcium-sensing receptors (CASRs) with NPS 89636. However, NOS-2 activation is inhibited by NPS 89626 during the MEK/ERK-dependent stage between 24 and 24.5 h after adding the cytokines, and this inhibition can be overridden by exogenous BH4. Therefore, NOS-2 expression and the subsequent BH4-dependent NOS-2-activation in human astrocytes need 1.8 mM Ca2+ to be in the culture medium, while NOS-2 activation also needs functional CASRs between 24 and 24.5 h after cytokine addition. These findings raise the possibility that calcilytic drugs prevent NO-induced damage and death of human neurons.

11909855|t|Purification and characterization of a cytosolic, 42-kDa and Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 from bovine red blood cells: its involvement in Ca2+-dependent release of arachidonic acid from mammalian red blood cells.
11909855|a|It has become evident that a Ca(2+)-dependent release of arachidonic acid (AA) and subsequent formation of bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes in red blood cells (RBCs) can modify physiological functions of neighboring RBCs and platelets. Here we identified a novel type of cytosolic PLA(2) in bovine and human RBCs and purified it to apparent homogeneity with a 14,000-fold purification. The purified enzyme, termed rPLA(2), has a molecular mass of 42 kDa and reveals biochemical properties similar to group IV cPLA(2), but shows different profiles from cPLA(2) in several column chromatographies. Moreover, rPLA(2) did not react with any of anti-cPLA(2) and anti-sPLA(2) antibodies and was identified as an unknown protein in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis. Divalent metal ions tested exhibited similar effects between rPLA(2) and cPLA(2), whereas mercurials inhibited cPLA(2) but had no effect on rPLA(2). Antibody against the 42-kDa protein not only precipitated the rPLA(2) activity, but also reacted with the 42-kDa protein from bovine and human RBCs in immunoblot analysis. The 42-kDa protein band was selectively detected in murine fetal liver cells known as a type of progenitor cells of RBCs. It was found that EA4, a derivative of quinone newly developed as an inhibitor for rPLA(2), inhibited a Ca(2+) ionophore-induced AA release from human and bovine RBCs, indicating that this enzyme is responsible for the Ca(2+)-dependent AA release from mammalian RBCs. Finally, erythroid progenitor cell assay utilizing diaminobenzidine staining of hemoglobinized fetal liver cells showed that rPLA(2) detectable in erythroid cells was down-regulated when differentiated to non-erythroid cells. Together, our results suggest that the 42-kDa rPLA(2) identified as a novel form of Ca(2+)-dependent PLA(2) may play an important role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and/or erythropoiesis through the Ca(2+)-dependent release of AA.

19669109|t|Extended nitric oxide measurements in exhaled air of cystic fibrosis and healthy adults.
19669109|a|In cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is not raised, but rather is normal or even decreased when measured at a single expiratory flow. FeNO measurements at several flow rates allow differentiation between alveolar and bronchial nitric oxide (NO) production. Extended FeNO measurements therefore should be useful to localize the FeNO deficit in CF airways. FeNO was measured in stable CF adults with moderate lung disease and in healthy controls. Bronchial NO fluxes (J(NO,Br)) and alveolar NO concentrations (C(Alv)) were calculated from FeNO measurements at flow rates of 100, 150 and 200 ml/s using a method previously described. Thirty-two adults were included in the study, 12 of whom had CF. CF adults had significantly lower FeNO values at all flow rates. The median J(NO,Br) was significantly lower in CF adults than in healthy controls [0.31 nl/s (range = 0.11-0.63) vs. 0.70 nl/s (0.27-3.52); P < 0.001], while the median C(Alv) was similar in both groups [1.7 ppb (0.3-3.9) vs. 1.2 (0.1-5.2)]. Pulmonary NO exchange did not differ significantly between subgroups of CF patients with and without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. No significant correlation was detectable between FEV(1)/VC and J(NO,Br) and C(Alv), respectively. Extended FeNO measurements can separate alveolar and bronchial NO outputs in CF adults. The lower FeNO in adults with moderate to severe CF lung disease is likely to be the result of lower bronchial NO output.

20827460|t|Post-operative opiate requirements after hip arthroscopy.
20827460|a|PURPOSE: Although hip arthroscopy continues to evolve in its use and its popularity grows, little attention has been paid to the anaesthetic and analgesic management of patients undergoing this procedure. We aimed to report on our initial experience of the anaesthetic and analgesic requirements of a consecutive series of patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. METHODS: We reviewed the surgical and anaesthetic records of the initial, consecutive 85 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for any reason at our hospital. Basic demographics, intra-operative findings, operative procedures, analgesic requirements in the form of opiate requirement and post-operative pain scores were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean intra-operative morphine dose was 7.1 mg (S.D. 3.2 mg). Thirty-nine patients (46%) required I.V. morphine at in the recovery room post-arthroscopy (mean 1.8 mg; S.D. 2.6 mg). Regression analysis showed that lower intra-operative opiate dose resulted in higher maximum VAS pain scores (P = 0.03) and rescue intravenous opiate (P < 0.001) requirement post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate intra-operative morphine use can minimize post-operative pain and subsequent need for rescue analgesia.

18789467|t|Corticosteroids in the treatment of dengue illness.
18789467|a|Dengue infection results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current recommended treatment is largely supportive with careful fluid replacement, with no specific treatment available. Although corticosteroids are not mentioned in the WHO guidelines on the management of dengue, clinicians use corticosteroids empirically based on the presumed immunological basis of the complications of dengue. The evidence base for the benefit or lack of benefit of corticosteroids in dengue is limited; previous studies have been small, with methodological flaws, less stringent randomisation and unclear allocation concealment, and were performed a long time ago. Studies so far have only been in patients with shock syndrome, and the possible effects of corticosteroids on thrombocytopenia and bleeding as well as other complications of dengue are unknown. All previous studies have been in children; the effect of corticosteroid treatment in adults with dengue infection has not been evaluated. The possible beneficial effects of corticosteroids on the various manifestations of dengue infection need evaluation by adequately powered, well designed, randomised controlled trials.

16123325|t|C-reactive protein decreases tissue plasminogen activator activity in human aortic endothelial cells: evidence that C-reactive protein is a procoagulant.
16123325|a|OBJECTIVE: C-reactive protein (CRP) can promote atherothrombosis by decreasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase and prostacyclin, and by stimulating both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in endothelial cells and tissue factor in mononuclear cells. Plasminogen activator-1, a marker of fibrinolysis, is the primary inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Thus, we tested the effect of CRP on tPA in human aortic endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Incubation of human aortic endothelial cells with CRP (> or =12.5 microg/mL) significantly decreased tPA antigen and activity. Adenyl cyclase inhibitors, an endothelin receptor antagonist, superoxide dismutase, and a nitric oxide donor failed to reverse the effect of CRP on tPA. CRP increased interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Neutralization of both IL-1beta and TNFalpha reversed the inhibition of tPA by CRP. Furthermore, in volunteers that have high CRP levels, euglobulin clot lysis time was significantly increased compared with those that have low CRP levels, providing further evidence that high CRP levels are associated with a procoagulant state. CONCLUSIONS: CRP inhibits tPA activity via generation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNFalpha). This study provides additional novel data that CRP is a procoagulant and has implications for atherothrombosis.

9220306|t|Effects of angiotensin II receptor blockade on N-terminal proatrial natriuretic factor plasma levels in chronic heart failure.
9220306|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma N-terminal proatrial natriuretic factor (N-terminal proANF) has been shown to reflect intraatrial pressures in heart failure patients, and may be used as a biochemical parameter of atrial pressures. It is still unclear how treatment of heart failure influences the relationship between hemodynamic parameters and plasma levels of N-terminal proANF. METHODS AND RESULTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated whether 12 weeks of treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan influenced N-terminal proANF plasma levels in 129 chronic heart failure patients. After 12 weeks of treatment, N-terminal proANF level was increased in patients given placebo by 344 +/- 1126 pmol/L, whereas in patients given 50 mg losartan, the levels had decreased by 251 +/- 886 pmol/L (P < .01 vs placebo). The change in N-terminal proANF correlated significantly with the corresponding change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = .53, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The correlation between N-terminal proANF plasma levels and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at baseline, as well as the correlation between the changes in these parameters during treatment, suggests that plasma N-terminal proANF may be used to monitor effects on left ventricular filling pressures in patients treated with losartan.

19861002|t|Mechanisms of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
19861002|a|The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) in the era of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presents a major threat to effective control of TB. Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis arises from spontaneous chromosomal mutations at low frequency. Clinical drug-resistant TB largely occurs as a result of man-made selection during disease treatment of these genetic alterations through erratic drug supply, suboptimal physician prescription and poor patient adherence. Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance have been elucidated for the major first- and second-line drugs rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, the aminoglycosides and the fluoroquinolones. The relationship between drug resistance in M. tuberculosis strains and their virulence/transmissibility needs to be further investigated. Understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis would enable the development of rapid molecular diagnostic tools and furnish possible insights into new drug development for the treatment of TB.

15818697|t|Evidence of radiographic benefit of treatment with infliximab plus methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients who had no clinical improvement: a detailed subanalysis of data from the anti-tumor necrosis factor trial in rheumatoid arthritis with concomitant therapy study.
15818697|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who have not responded clinically to treatment. METHODS: Changes from baseline to week 54 in clinical variables and measures of radiographic progression were compared between patients who received infliximab (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks) plus methotrexate (MTX) and those who received MTX plus placebo in the Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Trial in RA with Concomitant Therapy trial. RESULTS: At week 54, patients who did not show 20% improvement by American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 nonresponders) while receiving infliximab plus MTX exhibited mild but statistically significant improvement in clinical variables, including the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) (P < 0.001), tender joint count (P = 0.014), swollen joint count (P < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P < 0.001). Whereas the clinical and CRP changes among ACR20 nonresponders to infliximab plus MTX were small and much lower than among ACR20 responders to this treatment, radiographic progression among ACR20 nonresponders to infliximab plus MTX was significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) compared with ACR20 nonresponders to MTX plus placebo. Radiographic progression was much greater in patients receiving MTX plus placebo than in patients receiving infliximab plus MTX, irrespective of ACR response status (mean change in modified Sharp/van der Heijde score 6.0 in ACR20 responders and 7.2 in ACR20 nonresponders in the MTX plus placebo-treated group, versus 0.1 in ACR20 responders and 1.2 in ACR20 nonresponders in the infliximab plus MTX-treated group). Furthermore, among patients who were ACR20 nonresponders through week 54, patients who were DAS nonresponders at weeks 30 and 54, and patients without any improvement in individual clinical variables, those receiving infliximab plus MTX still demonstrated inhibition of structural damage that was statistically significant compared with inhibition in patients who received MTX plus placebo (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Even in patients without clinical improvement, treatment with infliximab plus MTX provided significant benefit with regard to the destructive process, suggesting that in such patients these 2 measures of disease are dissociated.

10461094|t|Influence of ion channel blockers on proliferation and free intracellular Ca2+ concentration of human keratinocytes.
10461094|a|The proliferation of in vitro cultivated keratinocytes from the HaCaT cell line while under the influence of different ion channel blockers, i.e. calcium channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and the nonspecific anion channel blocker 4',4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2-2' disulfonic acid (DIDS) was investigated. There were changes in proliferation of the keratinocytes brought on by TEA and DIDS. It can be assumed that the effects of TEA on proliferated keratinocytes lead to a temporary arrest of cells in the G(1)-phase of the cell cycle. The change in the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) had no influence on the proliferation of keratinocytes. During the entire course of investigations, the adding of DIDS leads to an increase in proliferation. Proliferation of keratinocytes is known to be greatly dependent on intracellular Ca2+ content ([Ca2+]i). The blocking of ion channels with TEA or DIDS does not lead to a change in the free [Ca2+]i. Also a change in the [K+]e does not lead to a displacement of the [Ca2+]i of keratinocytes.

16844790|t|A polymorphism within a conserved beta(1)-adrenergic receptor motif alters cardiac function and beta-blocker response in human heart failure.
16844790|a|Heterogeneity of heart failure (HF) phenotypes indicates contributions from underlying common polymorphisms. We considered polymorphisms in the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR), a beta-blocker target, as candidate pharmacogenomic loci. Transfected cells, genotyped human nonfailing and failing ventricles, and a clinical trial were used to ascertain phenotype and mechanism. In nonfailing and failing isolated ventricles, beta(1)-Arg-389 had respective 2.8 +/- 0.3- and 4.3 +/- 2.1-fold greater agonist-promoted contractility vs. beta(1)-Gly-389, defining enhanced physiologic coupling under relevant conditions of endogenous expression and HF. The beta-blocker bucindolol was an inverse agonist in failing Arg, but not Gly, ventricles, without partial agonist activity at either receptor; carvedilol was a genotype-independent neutral antagonist. In transfected cells, bucindolol antagonized agonist-stimulated cAMP, with a greater absolute decrease observed for Arg-389 (435 +/- 80 vs. 115 +/- 23 fmol per well). Potential pathophysiologic correlates were assessed in a placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol in 1,040 HF patients. No outcome was associated with genotype in the placebo group, indicating little impact on the natural course of HF. However, the Arg-389 homozygotes treated with bucindolol had an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted 38% reduction in mortality (P = 0.03) and 34% reduction in mortality or hospitalization (P = 0.004) vs. placebo. In contrast, Gly-389 carriers had no clinical response to bucindolol compared with placebo. Those with Arg-389 and high baseline norepinephrine levels trended toward improved survival, but no advantage with this allele and exaggerated sympatholysis was identified. We conclude that beta(1)AR-389 variation alters signaling in multiple models and affects the beta-blocker therapeutic response in HF and, thus, might be used to individualize treatment of the syndrome.

9378811|t|Enterocytozoon bieneusi in AIDS: symptomatic relief and parasite changes after furazolidone.
9378811|a|AIMS: To investigate changes in morphology of the developmental stages of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and symptomatic relief observed in AIDS patients after treatment with furazolidone. METHODS: Six AIDS patients with symptomatic E bieneusi infection of the small intestine were treated with a course of furazolidone. All patients had a weekly monitoring of parasite shedding in stool by light microscopy during and after treatment. At the end of the treatment, duodenal biopsy specimens obtained from three patients were studied by transmission electron microscopy by two pathologists who were unaware of the patients' treatment. RESULTS: All patients showed both clinical and parasitological response with transient clearance or decrease of spore shedding in stool. After treatment, alterations in faecal spores were observed in all patients by light microscopy, and ultrastructural changes in E bieneusi at all stages of the life cycle were demonstrated in biopsy specimens of the three patients who underwent post-treatment endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit seen after treatment with furazolidone in six AIDS patients with E bieneusi intestinal infection may be due to damage to the developmental stages causing a partial inhibition to reproduction of the parasite.

21397624|t|Sexual differentiation of human behavior: effects of prenatal and pubertal organizational hormones.
21397624|a|A key question concerns the extent to which sexual differentiation of human behavior is influenced by sex hormones present during sensitive periods of development (organizational effects), as occurs in other mammalian species. The most important sensitive period has been considered to be prenatal, but there is increasing attention to puberty as another organizational period, with the possibility of decreasing sensitivity to sex hormones across the pubertal transition. In this paper, we review evidence that sex hormones present during the prenatal and pubertal periods produce permanent changes to behavior. There is good evidence that exposure to high levels of androgens during prenatal development results in masculinization of activity and occupational interests, sexual orientation, and some spatial abilities; prenatal androgens have a smaller effect on gender identity, and there is insufficient information about androgen effects on sex-linked behavior problems. There is little good evidence regarding long-lasting behavioral effects of pubertal hormones, but there is some suggestion that they influence gender identity and perhaps some sex-linked forms of psychopathology, and there are many opportunities to study this issue.

19822150|a|Herein, we report that dihydrolipoic acid and lipoic acid (LA) plus lipoamide dehydrogenase and NADH denitrosate S-nitrosocaspase 3 (CASP-SNO). In HepG2 cells, S-nitroso-L-cysteine ethyl ester (SNCEE) impeded the activity of caspase 3 (CASP-SH), while a subsequent incubation of the cells in SNCEE-free medium resulted in endogenous denitrosation and reactivation of CASP-SH. The latter process was inhibited in thioredoxin reductase-deficient HepG2 cells, in which, however, LA markedly reactivated CASP-SH. The data obtained are discussed with focus on low molecular mass dithiols that mimic the activity of thioredoxin in reactions of protein S-denitrosation.

20579773|t|Carvedilol as a potential novel agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
20579773|a|Oligomeric b-amyloid (Ab) has recently been linked to synaptic plasticity deficits, which play a major role in progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we present evidence that chronic oral administration of carvedilol, a nonselective b-adrenergic receptor blocker, significantly attenuates brain oligomeric b-amyloid content and cognitive deterioration in 2 independent AD mouse models. We found that carvedilol treatment significantly improved neuronal transmission, and that this improvement was associated with the maintenance of number of the less stable "learning" thin spines in the brains of AD mice. Our novel observation that carvedilol interferes with the neuropathologic, biochemical, and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deterioration in AD supports the potential development of carvedilol as a treatment for AD.

11562112|t|A multiethnic population-based study of smoking, alcohol and body size and risk of adenocarcinomas of the stomach and esophagus (United States).
11562112|a|OBJECTIVES: Since the 1970s incidence rates for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas have risen substantially, particularly among white males in the United States. Reasons for the increase of these tumor types are not well understood. We sought to determine the role of smoking, alcohol use, and body size characteristics in the etiology of esophageal, gastric cardia, and distal gastric adenocarcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population-based case-control study that included Whites, African-Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans diagnosed with incident esophageal (n = 222), gastric cardia (n = 277), and distal gastric adenocarcinomas (n = 443), and 1356 control subjects was conducted in Los Angeles County. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs), as an estimate of the relative risk, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the three tumor types of interest. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, gender, race, birthplace, and education, current cigarette smoking was a significant risk factor for all tumor types; the association was strongest for esophageal adenocarcinomas (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.8-4.3), intermediate for gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.5-3.1), and weaker for distal gastric adenocarcinomas (OR= 1.50, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1). For esophageal adenocarcinomas only, cigarette smoking had a long-lasting deleterious effect, even 20 years after smoking cessation. Alcohol use was not associated with an increased risk of these tumor types. Risks of esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas also increased statistically significantly in a dose-dependent manner with increasing body mass index measured at ages 20 and 40 years and recently. The positive associations with smoking and body mass index were generally consistent when evaluated separately for Whites, non-Whites, males, and females. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking and high body mass index are significant, independent risk factors for esophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas. Studies designed to understand the mechanisms whereby smoking and high body mass influence these tumor types are needed.

23774194|t|A retrospective comparison of the effects of propofol and etomidate on stimulus variables and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in depressed inpatients.
23774194|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of propofol and etomidate on the stimulus variables and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in depressed inpatients. METHOD: This retrospective study included 54 inpatients (aged 18-75 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for major depression and were treated with bilateral ECT. For the first part of the study, the primary outcome was the mean stimulus charge per ECT session. For the second part, the main outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving full remission. RESULTS: Propofol-treated patients showed a higher mean stimulus charge (etomidate = 227.58  ± 130.44, propofol = 544.91  ± 237.56, p<0.001) despite the lack of a significant difference in starting threshold doses. The propofol group had shorter mean electroencephalogram (etomidate = 69.41  ± 22.50, propofol = 42.95  ± 22.26, p<0.001) seizure duration and motor (etomidate = 46.11  ± 14.38, propofol = 22.89  ± 7.13, p<0.001) seizure duration and a higher mean number of inadequate seizures (etomidate = 0.12  ± 0.15, propofol = 0.47  ± 0.26, p<0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups for the effects of the anesthetics on the efficacy of ECT. LIMITATIONS: Our study is limited by a retrospective design and the small number of patients treated with propofol restricted the sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia with propofol has a significant reducing effect on seizure duration during the course of ECT which results in more inadequate seizures, despite the use of a higher mean stimulus charge. Regarding the possible effect of the anesthetics on ECT, randomized clinical trials with sufficient power to detect differences are warranted.

21133822|t|Combination of low-dose aspirin and thienopyridine exacerbates small bowel injury.
21133822|a|OBJECTIVE: Antithrombotics is increasingly being used for cardiovascular prevention. In more recent studies, small bowel injury and enteropathy associated with low-dose aspirin are increasingly being recognized. Aim of this study was to evaluate small bowel injury using video capsule endoscopy (VCE) in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) patients taking low-dose aspirin including other antithrombotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of chronic users of antithrombotics who underwent VCE for suspected small bowel bleeding. Small bowel mucosal injury was evaluated using VCE findings. RESULTS: Fifty-four OGIB patients (36 men and 18 women, mean age 72.4 years) underwent VCE from January 2007 to May 2009. Twenty-two patients were taking 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin (aspirin group), 8 taking thienopyridine, (ticlopidine or clopidogrel, thienopyridine group), 13 taking aspirin combined with thienopyridine (combined group), and 11 taking warfarin (warfarin group). The mucosal injury, especially ulcers were most frequently detected in the combined group (46.2%, p = 0.01) among the four groups. The median number of redness lesions in the combined group was the highest among the four groups and was significantly higher than that in the warfarin group. The lesions of redness or small erosions in the aspirin and the combined groups tended to exist in the proximal part of small bowel. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of low-dose aspirin therapy and thienopyridine may exacerbate small bowel injury, and the preventive strategies should be established.

15503867|t|GPCR-GIP networks: a first step in the discovery of new therapeutic drugs?
15503867|a|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane molecules that, on interaction with G proteins upon ligand binding, can associate with a large variety of transmembrane or soluble proteins, termed 'GPCR-interacting proteins' (GIPs). Some special transmembrane GIPs are themselves GPCRs that form homo- or heterodimers, while other transmembrane GIPs are ionic channels, ionotropic receptors and single transmembrane proteins that control GPCR pharmacology and trafficking. Most soluble GIPs interact with the C-termini of GPCRs and often physically link GPCRs to large protein networks, called 'receptosomes', that include ionic channels, protein kinases, small G proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and adhesion molecules. Here, we review the nature and functions of some of these networks, such as the glutamate and serotonin receptosomes, and focus on the fine-tuning of GPCR signaling by GIPs. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for developing new therapeutic drugs capable of modulating GPCR signaling by disrupting or reinforcing specific GPCR-GIP interactions.

11213363|t|Uptake by vascular smooth muscle cells plays an important role in targeting of lipid microspheres incorporating prostaglandin E1 into a thickened intima.
11213363|a|A study was done to determine how lipid microspheres (LM) containing prostaglandin E1 (lipo PGE1) accumulate in injured arterial tissue. After administration of lipo PGE1 labeled with a fluorescence probe, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-lipo PGE1) to rats 14 of days after balloon injury of the carotid artery, localization into the injured site was examined using a fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). In contrast with the normal carotid artery, DiI-lipo PGE1 accumulated remarkably in neointima of the injured site which was occupied mainly by the migration of the proliferating and quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). In vitro cellular uptake of DiI-lipo PGE1 was semi-quantitatively measured using CLSM, regarding differentiated and proliferative phenotypes of human vascular SMC, compared with the human endothelial cells (EC) and mouse fibroblasts. The differentiated SMC incorporated DiI-lipo PGE1 to equal or a higher level of the proliferative phenotype, and was significantly higher than EC and fibroblasts. The uptake of DiI-lipo PGE1 by both SMC and EC was inhibited at 4 degrees C, by dansylcadaverine and excessive LM, but was unaffected by cytochalasin B. These results suggest that the uptake of DiI-lipo PGE1 by SMC plays an important role in localization of DiI-lipo PGE1 at the injured site, and that the uptake seems to be a receptor mediated endocytosis.

7923316|t|Alpha 1-blockade for the treatment of hypertension: a megastudy of terazosin in 2214 clinical practice settings.
7923316|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the alpha 1-blocking agent terazosin on blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids in a large, variant population of patients with hypertension. A total of 16,917 patients with hypertension were evaluated at 2214 primary and community care facilities; 7808 of these patients had not been treated previously for hypertension; 3928 were switched to terazosin from another antihypertensive agent; and 5181 received terazosin in addition to an agent that had not controlled their hypertension. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in systolic (-18.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and diastolic (-13.2 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) BP when used as monotherapy (mean dose, 3.1 mg; range, 2 to 10 mg) without causing a significant increase in heart rate. Equal antihypertensive efficacy was demonstrated in men, women, blacks, and whites of all ages, with particular benefit to elderly patients (> or = 65 years of age) with systolic hypertension. Comparative studies indicated that terazosin had equal antihypertensive efficacy in combination with diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Patients who had not responded to monotherapy with one of these classes of antihypertensive drugs showed significant reductions of BP after terazosin, in the following average doses, was added to diuretics, 3.1 mg; beta-blockers, 3.4 mg; calcium channel blockers, 3.3 mg; and ACE inhibitors, 3.4 mg. Terazosin produced highly significant reductions in blood levels of total cholesterol (-5.0%), triglycerides (-6.1%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.6%) without change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy. Similar favorable effects on blood lipid levels were demonstrated when terazosin was used in combination with all other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The greatest reductions in blood cholesterol (-9.2%) were observed among patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > or = 240 mg/dL). Terazosin maintained its antihypertensive efficacy and was well tolerated by patients with a variety of concomitant diseases, including congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and obesity. Adverse effects occurred in 17.9% of patients and caused 2.2% to drop out of the study. The most frequent adverse effects were dizziness (4.8%), headache (2.5%), and asthenia (2.4%). Only 0.4% suffered syncope and 0.2% impotence. These data demonstrate the usefulness of terazosin as monotherapy or add-on therapy for treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

1590686|t|Double-blind randomized study of the effect of infusion rates on toxicity of amphotericin B.
1590686|a|Results of a double-blind randomized non-crossover study of rapid (45 min) versus slow (4 h) infusion of amphotericin B administered to 20 patients with proven or suspected fungal infection are reported. Toxicity was higher in the rapid infusion group than it was in the slow infusion group (mean total 7-day chill score, 173 +/- 276 versus 20 +/- 30 [P less than 0.01]; mean total 7-day dosage of meperidine required to abate rigors, 180 +/- 133 versus 58 +/- 78 mg [P less than 0.05]; and mean maximum total 7-day pulse rise, 225 +/- 64 versus 135 +/- 56 beats per min [P less than 0.02], respectively). When analyzed on a daily basis, the mean chill score, meperidine dosage, and pulse rise were also higher; and in addition, nausea and vomiting (5 of 11 patients who received a rapid infusion versus 0 of 9 patients who received a slow infusion [P less than 0.01]) appeared to be more common in those who received amphotericin B rapidly. The daily analysis approach proved that tolerance to these side effects developed with each subsequent infusion day, and by day 7 the incidence and severity were the same. This development of tolerance was significant for the mean chill score in the rapid infusion group (P less than 0.05) and for the proportion of patients with chills (P less than 0.005 for the slow infusion group; P less than 0.05 for the rapid infusion group). A decrease in creatinine clearance to greater than 51% of the baseline value was seen in two patients in each group. There were five deaths (four in the rapid infusion group, 1 in the slow infusion group) within 1 month, but none was clearly related to the amphotericin B infusion. The mean time to defervescence was similar for each group (10.8 +/- 4.1 days in the slow infusion group versus 9.9 +/- 5 days in the rapid infusion group). A rapid infusion regimen for amphotericin B cannot be recommended, at least during the first 5 to 7 days of treatment.

23770455|t|Understanding the toxicity of carbon nanotubes in the environment is crucial to the control of nanomaterials in producing and processing and the assessment of health risk for human: a review.
23770455|a|With the development and application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the potential hazards of CNTs to biological systems and the environment are getting more and more attention. This review evaluated the effects of physicochemical properties of CNTs on toxicity and summarized the advances on the mechanism of CNTs toxicity. We also proposed the possible hazards associated with CNTs and harmful effects resulting from exposure of aquatic animals, bacteria and higher plants to CNTs in vitro and in vivo. The current knowledge and gaps on CNTs were outlined as a potential problem for the environment and human health. The current research gaps on CNTs toxicity were identified and the further studying focus was proposed, too. This essay concluded with a set of recommendations for the advancement of understanding of the role of CNTs and future challenges in environmental and ecotoxicological research.

8070007|t|Epirubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma: pharmacokinetics and clinical activity.
8070007|a|The pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of epirubicin were investigated in 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received epirubicin at 75 mg/m2; the drug was given intravenously to 7 patients and via the hepatic artery to 9 patients (7 of whom also underwent embolisation). Lignocaine (1 mg/kg) was also given intravenously to 15 patients, and the metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) was measured as an indicator of liver function. Epirubicin clearance correlated with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin and bilirubin values in patients treated intravenously or intraarterially. Although the route of administration did not affect the median total plasma clearance of epirubicin, early- and intermediate-phase clearance was higher following intraarterial administration. MEGX levels correlated with serum bilirubin levels but there was no correlation with albumin or AST values or epirubicin clearance. The rate of response to epirubicin was 3/13 (23%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-50%). Intravenous epirubicin was tolerated well, but intraarterial treatment was associated with significant morbidity. These data confirm that although current recommended dose adjustments are based primarily on serum bilirubin levels, altered epirubicin pharmacokinetics correlate more strongly with AST and albumin values than with serum bilirubin concentrations. However, at this dose and schedule, epirubicin has only modest activity against HCC.

17132099|t|Endogenous anti-inflammatory substances, inter-alpha-inhibitor and bikunin.
17132099|a|There have been new developments in the elucidation of the biological functions of the inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI) family. The anti-proteolytic activity of the IalphaI family originates from bikunin (also known as urinary trypsin inhibitor). Growing evidence indicates that bikunin is not just an anti-proteolytic agent, but can also be considered an anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine synthesis. Bikunin functions to inhibit calcium influx and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via LPS receptors and/or as yet unidentified bikunin signaling receptors. By signaling via the LPS receptor, LPS increases calcium influx and yields phosphorylated ERK, which activates multiple transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) or early growth response-1 (Egr-1), which in turn promote cytokine expression. Deficits in the signaling cascades caused by free or cell-bound bikunin are predicted to down-regulate cytokine expression, render macrophages/neutrophils more inactive, and impair inflammatory processes. This brief review largely focuses on our current understanding of the apparent functions of bikunin, its ligands, the effector molecules with which it interacts, and its regulation.

1424001|t|Differences in vasomotor control between human gastroepiploic and left internal mammary artery.
1424001|a|BACKGROUND: Internal mammary artery grafts have a greater long-term patency rate than do saphenous vein grafts. This has in part been attributed to the difference in endothelial function of arterial and venous vessels. The use of the gastroepiploic artery in coronary artery bypass grafting has become popular recently because of its similarity to internal mammary artery. In this study, we compared the endothelial responses of gastroepiploic and left internal mammary arteries to vasoactive substances. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gastroepiploic and left internal mammary arteries were obtained during surgery from patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Vascular rings of both graft types were studied in organ bath experiments. Relaxation responses to metacholine and sodium nitrite were similar in rings of both arteries. In contrast, bradykinin induced potent relaxations in rings of the gastroepiploic artery but not in rings of the left internal mammary artery. Furthermore, there was a inverse correlation of maximal metacholine-induced relaxations with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: The resemblance of relaxations induced by metacholine and sodium nitrite in both gastroepiploic and left internal mammary arteries suggests a similar activation and behavior of the L-arginine pathway in both arteries. The difference in bradykinin-induced relaxations may reflect a prostaglandin metabolism in the gastroepiploic artery different from that in the left internal mammary artery. Furthermore, maximal metacholine-induced relaxation in rings of the left internal mammary artery shows an age dependency that was not observed in rings of the gastroepiploic artery.

15620719|t|PD98059 and U0126 activate AMP-activated protein kinase by increasing the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and not via inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway.
15620719|a|The MAP kinase pathway inhibitor U0126 caused phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased phosphorylation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in HEK293 cells. This effect only occurred in cells expressing the upstream kinase, LKB1. Of two other widely used MAP kinase pathway inhibitors not closely related in structure to U0126, PD98059 also activated AMPK but PD184352 did not. U0126 and PD98059, but not PD184352, also increased the cellular ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios, accounting for their ability to activate AMPK. These results suggest the need for caution in interpreting experiments conducted using U0126 and PD98059.

20084783|t|A short outpatient hydration schedule for cisplatin administration.
20084783|a|BACKGROUND: Cisplatin remains a principal chemotherapy agent in the treatment of many solid tumours. However because of its nephrotoxicity, inpatient hydration schedules have been utilized to ensure safe administration. In May 1995, due to significant load on in-patient bed availability, the Medical Oncology Department of the Cancer Therapy Centre, Liverpool Hospital, developed a short, intravenous fluid hydration protocol to be used on an out-patient setting. METHODS: Following an initial pilot program of the abbreviated hydration regimen, a retrospective study of all adult in-patients and out-patients who received cisplatin (60-100 mg/m2) from May 1995 to August 1998 was conducted. Biochemistry was performed prior to the start of chemotherapy, and a repeat serum creatinine level was taken immediately prior to each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy, unless clinically indicated at an earlier time. The in-patient hydration protocol was 6000 ml of normal saline with 60 mmol/L KCL, and 30 mmol/L MgSO4 over 24 to 28 hours, and the out-patient hydration was 4000 ml of normal saline over 6 hours. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were included, 57 in-patient (39%) and 88 out-patients (61%), 95 males, and 50 females. The mean age was 56 years. The maximum mean percentage change in creatinine from baseline for all cycles of chemotherapy for in-patients was 32.5% ranging from -7% to 288% (95% CI=19.9-45.11), and for outpatients 19.9% ranging from -20% to 154% (95% CI=13.47-26.39). Although the mean increase was higher in the in-patient group by 12.6%, it was not statistically significant (p=0.079). CONCLUSION: In patient's eligible for cis-platinum therapy on the basis of good performance status and normal renal function, this agent can be safely administered in the out-patient setting with an abbreviated duration, moderate volume intravenous hydration regimen.

9270425|a|Reversible and irreversible ototoxicity has been documented following the administration of various therapeutic agents. Reversible hearing loss is a known complication following the administration of quinine, salicylates and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and erythromycin. We report a case of reversible hearing loss following OKT3 (murine monoclonal antibody CD3) administration. OKT3, a monoclonal antibody used as an immunosuppressant following cadaveric renal transplants, was associated with a transient sensorineural hearing loss that reversed following discontinuation of OKT3.

21355449|t|The multiple uses of ethinyl estradiol for treating infertility.
21355449|a|PURPOSE: To demonstrate the usefulness of ethinyl estradiol, a drug no longer commercially produced in most countries, in treating various fertility related issues. METHODS: Twenty to 40 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol can be started on day 2 or 3 of the cycle and combined with exogenous gonadotropin can be useful in improving hostile cervical mucus or inducing ovulation in women with hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. It can be used from the day after stopping clomiphene citrate to help negate the adverse effect of this drug on cervical mucus. RESULTS: Successful pregnancies have been achieved saving the couple the expense of intrauterine insemination (IUI) or using donor oocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This drug can be very helpful for those physicians who treat each infertile woman on an individual basis and carefully ascertain the couple's input as to their preferences rather than a "herd" type of medicine.

12829918|t|Mycophenolate mofetil-based immunosuppression and cytokine genotypes: effects on monokine secretion and antigen presentation in long-term renal transplant recipients.
12829918|a|BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that increased monocyte responses might play a role in chronic allograft rejection. METHODS: We investigated in vitro monokine responses in 112 patients with long-term stable kidney graft function (ST patients; n=80, non-mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]; n=32, MMF) and 25 patients with chronic renal transplant rejection (CR patients; non-MMF). Interleukin 10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha promoter gene polymorphisms were tested by polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific primers; antigen-presenting capacity (AC) of monocytes was tested by incubation with staphylococcal superantigens (SEA, SEE, SED). RESULTS: Although non-MMF-based immunosuppression in ST patients did not result in compromised AC or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monokine responses compared with healthy controls, we found MMF therapy to be associated with significantly reduced TNF-R1 expression on monocytes (P<0.001), suppressed AC (P<0.02, SED), and suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta, IL-10, and TNF-alpha secretion (P<0.01). Coinciding with a significantly higher steroid dosage in CR patients, IL-6 receptor and TNF-R1 expression on monocytes were down-regulated (P< or =0.02) and AC was suppressed in CR compared with ST (non-MMF) patients (P<0.01, SED; P<0.05, SEE). However, LPS-stimulated monokine secretion was not decreased or even enhanced (IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]; P<0.05). Enhanced in vitro IL-10 responses (>500 pg/mL) were found predominantly in non-MMF-treated patients with the IL-10 genotype GCC (GCC: 23/62 [37%], non-GCC: 2/27 [7%], P<0.005; GCC and non-MMF: 22/47 [47%], GCC and MMF: 1/15 [7%], P<0.005]. CONCLUSION: Steroids and azathioprine did not sufficiently suppress monokine responses, whereas MMF treatment might inhibit chronic graft rejection because of suppression of TNF-R1 expression and vigorous inhibition of monokine secretion. MMF treatment may especially be indicated in patients with the IL-10 "high-producer" genotype GCC.

21534917|t|A fluorescence polarization based screening assay for identification of small molecule inhibitors of the PICK1 PDZ domain.
21534917|a|PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology) domains represent putative targets in several diseases including cancer, stroke, addiction and neuropathic pain. Here we describe the application of a simple and fast screening assay based on fluorescence polarization (FP) to identify inhibitors of the PDZ domain in PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1). We screened 43,380 compounds for their ability to inhibit binding of an Oregon Green labeled C-terminal dopamine transporter peptide (OrG-DAT C13) to purified PICK1 in solution. The assay was highly reliable with excellent screening assay parameters (Z' 0.7 and Z 0.6). Out of ~200 compounds that reduced FP to less than 80% of the control wells, six compounds were further characterized. The apparent affinities of the compounds were determined in FP competition binding experiments and ranged from ~5.0  µM to ~193  µM. Binding to the PICK1 PDZ domain was confirmed for five of the compounds (CSC-03, CSC-04, CSC-43, FSC-231 and FSC-240) in a non-fluorescence based assay by their ability to inhibit pull-down of PICK1 by a C-terminal DAT GST fusion protein. CSC-03 displayed the highest apparent affinity (5.0  µM) in the FP assay, and was according to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments capable of inhibiting the interaction between the C-terminus of the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor and PICK1 in live cells. Additional experiments suggested that CSC-03 most likely is an irreversible inhibitor but with specificity for PICK1 since it did not bind three different PDZ domains of PSD-95. Summarized, our data suggest that FP based screening assays might be a widely applicable tool in the search for small molecule inhibitors of PDZ domain interactions.

15820297|t|Carvedilol reduces the costs of medical care in severe heart failure: an economic analysis of the COPERNICUS study applied to the United Kingdom.
15820297|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of carvedilol on the costs related to the treatment of severe chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Costs for the treatment for heart failure within the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) were applied to resource utilisation data prospectively collected in all patients randomized into the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) Study. Unit-specific, per diem (hospital bed day) costs were used to calculate expenditures due to hospitalizations. We also included costs of carvedilol treatment, general practitioner surgery/office visits, hospital out-patient clinic visits and nursing home care based on estimates derived from validated patterns of clinical practice in the UK. RESULTS: The estimated cost of carvedilol therapy and related ambulatory care for the 1156 patients assigned to active treatment was pound530,771 ( pound44.89 per patient/month of follow-up). However, patients assigned to carvedilol were hospitalised less often and accumulated fewer and less expensive days of admission. Consequently, the total estimated cost of hospital care was pound3.49 million in the carvedilol group compared with pound4.24 million for the 1133 patients in the placebo arm. The cost of post-discharge care was also less in the carvedilol than in the placebo group ( pound479,200 vs. pound548,300). Overall, the cost per patient treated in the carvedilol group was pound3948 compared to pound4279 in the placebo group. This equated to a cost of pound385.98 vs. pound434.18, respectively, per patient/month of follow-up: an 11.1% reduction in health care costs in favour of carvedilol. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that not only can carvedilol treatment increase survival and reduce hospital admissions in patients with severe CHF but that it can also cut costs in the process.

19691613|t|Rosuvastatin treatment is associated with an increase in insulin resistance in hyperlipidaemic patients with impaired fasting glucose.
19691613|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: The increase in physician-reported diabetes following rosuvastatin treatment in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin study has raised concerns whether this statin exerts a detrimental effect on glucose metabolism. We assessed the effect of rosuvastatin treatment across dose range on glucose homeostasis in hyperlipidaemic patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), who are at high risk to develop diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The medical records of 72 hypelipidaemic patients with IFG on rosuvastatin 10 (RSV10 group), 20 (RSV20 group) and 40 mg/day (RSV40 group) were reviewed. The median follow up was 12.4 weeks. At the first visit, prior to rosuvastatin prescription and at the latest visit, serum lipid profile and indices of glucose metabolism, including fasting glucose, insulin and HOmeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA(IR)) index levels, were assessed. RESULTS: Rosuvastatin treatment improved lipid profile and was associated with a dose-dependent significant increase in HOMA(IR) values by 25.4%, 32.3% and 44.8% at the dose of 10, 20 and 40 mg/day (p < 0.01 for all, p < 0.05 for the comparison between groups), respectively, mirrored by correspondent increase in plasma insulin levels [by 21.7%, 25.7% and 46.2% in the RSV10, RSV20 and RSV40 group (p < 0.001 for all) respectively]. Baseline HOMA(IR) levels was the most important contributor (R(2) = 68.1%, p < 0.001), followed by the dose of rosuvastatin treatment (R(2) = 23.7%, p < 0.01), in a model that explained 91.8% of the variability in HOMA(IR) increase. CONCLUSION: In patients with IFG and hyperlipidaemia, rosuvastatin treatment was associated with a dose-dependent increase in insulin resistance.

8344645|t|Repetitive GHRH administration fails to increase the response to GHRH in obese subjects. Evidence for a somatotrope defect in obesity?
8344645|a|Spontaneous GH secretion as well as GH response to several stimuli including GHRH have been shown to be reduced in obesity. To clarify the pathogenesis underlying these alterations, in six obese patients (3 males and 3 females, age 20-44 yrs, BMI = 42.1 +/- 2.2) on unrestricted diet we studied the effect of 8 day GHRH pretreatment (1 micrograms/kg iv each day) on the acute somatotropic response to the neurohormone administered both alone and combined with arginine (ARG, 0.5 g/kg iv infused from 0 to 30 min) which likely inhibits the release of hypothalamic somatostatin. Before treatment the GH response to GHRH (AUC: 231.9 +/- 106.4 micrograms/l/h) was potentiated (p < 0.001) by ARG (932.6 +/- 166.2 micrograms/l/h). However, the GH responses to the neurohormone both alone and combined with ARG were lower (p < 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) than in normals (712.4 +/- 111.6 and 2608.3 +/- 453.2 micrograms/l/h, respectively). After repetitive GHRH administration, in obese subjects baseline GH and IGF-I levels were unchanged. Also the GH responses to GHRH both alone (217.3 +/- 68.1 micrograms/l/h) and combined with ARG (756.3 +/- 202.9 micrograms/l/h) were not modified. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the failure of GHRH pretreatment to improve the somatotrope hyporesponsiveness to GHRH both alone and combined with ARG suggesting the existence of a somatotropic defect in obesity.

20693173|t|Cephalosporin MIC creep among gonococci: time for a pharmacodynamic rethink?
20693173|a|BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea has been among the easiest infections to cure with antibiotics. Nevertheless, emerging resistance has driven repeated treatment shifts. Decreased cephalosporin susceptibility is now being reported. We examined cephalosporin MIC trends for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the UK and undertook pharmacodynamic analyses to predict efficacy against strains with raised MICs. METHODS: Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were collected annually in a structured surveillance from 26 genitourinary medicine clinics in England and Wales. MICs were determined by agar dilution and confirmed by Etests. Pharmacodynamic modelling was performed for cefixime and ceftriaxone with Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: There was a progressive emergence of small numbers of gonococci with cephalosporin MICs of 0.125-0.25 mg/L; these were not seen before 2005 but, for ceftriaxone and cefixime, respectively, accounted for 0.4% (95% confidence interval 0.2%-1.1%) and 2.8% (1.6%-4.8%) of the 1253 isolates collected in 2008; such MICs are 16-64 times the modal values for the species. Pharmacodynamic analysis was complicated by evidence that cephalosporins need a longer period with the free drug level above MIC than the 7-10 h required for penicillin G; nevertheless, pharmacodynamic analyses predict that failures with the standard 400 mg cefixime po and 250 mg ceftriaxone im regimens become likely around the present MIC maxima. CONCLUSIONS: Gonococci with ceftriaxone and cefixime MICs of 0.125-0.25 mg/L are accumulating in the UK. These MICs lie on the edge of likely responsiveness to current regimens, which need review. Possible responses include: (i) higher cephalosporin doses; (ii) multidose cephalosporin regimens; (iii) multidrug regimens; (iv) microbiologically directed treatment; or, in the future, (v) drug cycling. The practicalities of these approaches are discussed.

12964967|t|Assessment of the frequency of mutant (hprt-) T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
12964967|a|A salient feature of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is the T-cell-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland leading to hypothyroidism. In HT, as in other autoimmune diseases, a central premise has been that autoreactive T cells must be dividing in response to autoantigens, accumulating random spontaneous mutations during the activation process. Here, we have examined this hypothesis by using as monitor of somatic cell mutation the hprt gene, encoding the salvage pathway enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. Eleven newly diagnosed patients with HT and 10 patients with chronic disease were selected for the study, whereas 10 healthy individuals were used as controls. Peripheral T cells were cultured under limiting dilution conditions in the presence of 6-thioguanine and the frequency (MF) of surviving mutant hprt(-) T cells was calculated by Poisson statistics. It was observed that the mean MF value of either patient group (6.6 +/- 5.8 per 10(6) cells for the newly diagnosed, and 8.8 +/- 4.0 per 10(6) cells for the patients with chronic disease) was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that of the control group (6.8 +/- 6.4 per 10(6) cells). These data do not support the concept that patients with HT have an increased number of actively dividing T cells in the circulation compared to healthy controls. Autoreactive T cells may be activated mainly in situ or home readily to the thyroid in the early stages of the disease and reach a nonexpansion stage as the chronic disease is stabilized.

9546601|t|Inhibition of human topoisomerase II by anti-neoplastic benzazolo[3,2-alpha]quinolinium chlorides.
9546601|a|Previously we reported [20] that there is no correlation between the cytotoxic activity of four new structural analogs of the antitumor DNA intercalator 3-nitrobenzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-2) and their interaction with DNA. In the present study, we present evidence suggesting that the molecular basis for the anti-proliferative activity of these drugs is the inhibition of topoisomerase II. The NBQ-2 derivatives inhibited the relaxation of supercoiled DNA plasmid pRYG mediated by purified human topoisomerase II. Inhibition of the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA mediated by partially purified topoisomerase II extracted from the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 (a cell line previously shown to be sensitive to the drugs) was also caused by these drugs. The potency of the benzazolo[3,2-a]quinolinium drugs against topoisomerase II in vitro was the following: 7-(1-propenyl)-3-nitrobenzimidazolo[3,2-a]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-59) > 4-chlorobenzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-76) > 7-ethyl-3-nitrobenzimidazolo[3,2-a]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-48) > 7-benzyl-3-nitrobenzimidazolol[3,2-a]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-38). This rank of potency for topoisomerase II inhibition correlated very well with the cytotoxicity elicited by these drugs. Furthermore, significant levels of topoisomerase II/DNA cleavage complex induced by these drugs in vivo were detected when U937 cells were treated with NBQ-59 and NBQ-76 whereas NBQ-38 and NBQ-48 produced negligible amounts of the cleavage complex. Our results strongly suggest that topoisomerase II is the major cellular target of this family of compounds.

23375583|t|The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the trans9, trans11 conjugated linoleic acid isomer on MCF-7 breast cancer cells are associated with LXR activation.
23375583|a|Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), naturally found in dairy products and ruminant meat, are positional and geometric isomers (trans: t or cis: c) of linoleic acid, and have been widely reported to possess anti-tumoral activity against breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. CLA isomer t9,t11 was recently proposed as an agonist of the transcriptional factor LXR, which is known for inducing genes implicated in cholesterol efflux. In this study, the growth inhibitory effect of three CLA isomers (c9,t11-CLA, t9,t11-CLA and t10,c12-CLA) was investigated on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, as well as their effect on LXR target genes. Our results revealed that t9,t11-CLA was the most efficient isomer by decreasing MCF-7 proliferation, inhibiting migration, and inducing apoptosis after 24h of treatment. t9,t11-CLA treatment led to an increase in the mRNA levels of LXR target genes involved in cholesterol efflux (ABCG1 and ARL7), as well as an increase of HMG-CoA-reductase which is the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, confocal microscopy analysis showed that t9,t11-CLA treatment remarkably reduced the intracellular and membrane-associated cholesterol levels. LXR activation through t9,t11-CLA isomer could lead to cholesterol cell deprivation by stimulating its efflux, which results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and stimulation of apoptosis.

21722161|t|Cardiac ischaemic stress: cardiomyocyte Ca ² º, sex and sex steroids.
21722161|a|1. Important sex differences exist in ischaemic heart disease. Oestrogen has been conventionally regarded as providing a cardioprotective benefit and testosterone frequently perceived to exert a deleterious effect. However, there is accumulating evidence that argues against this simple dichotomy, suggesting that the influence of oestrogen and testosterone conferring benefit or detriment may be context specific. 2. Cardiomyocyte calcium (Ca(2+)) loading is recognized to be a major factor in acute ischaemia-reperfusion pathology, promoting cell death, contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenic activity. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a mediator of many of the cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)-related pathologies in ischaemia-reperfusion. Cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)-handling processes have been shown to be modulated by the actions of oestrogen and testosterone. A role for these sex steroids in influencing CaMKII activation is argued. 3. Although many experimental studies of oestrogen manipulation can identify a cardioprotective role for this sex steroid, there are also numerous reports that fail to demonstrate sex differences in postischaemic recovery. Experimental studies report that testosterone can be protective in ischaemia-reperfusion in males and females in some settings. 4. Further studies of sex steroid influence in the ischaemic heart will allow the development of therapeutic interventions that are specifically targeted for male and female hearts.

17475987|t|Symptomatic relapse of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children.
17475987|a|The frequency of symptomatic relapses following various antibiotic treatments for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis was evaluated in 1080 pediatric patients. Within 5 days of completing therapy, the rank-order frequency of treatment failures was (1) penicillin, (2) amoxicillin, (3) first-generation cephalosporins, (4) beta-lactamase stable cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulanate ( P = .005). Retreatment of symptomatic failures resulted in another symptomatic relapse more often with penicillin than with cephalosporins (P = .02). Clinicians should be aware that the rate of symptomatic failures after antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis differs by drug and is not an uncommon event.

23386105|t|In vitro and in vivo evaluation of lipofufol, a new triple stealth liposomal formulation of modulated 5-fu: impact on efficacy and toxicity.
23386105|a|PURPOSE: Drug resistance and severe toxicities are limitations when handling 5-FU. We have developed a triple liposomal formulation of 5-FU combined to 2'-deoxyinosine and folinic acid to improve its efficacy-toxicity balance. METHODS: Stealth liposomes were obtained using the thin-film method. Antiproliferative activity was tested on human colorectal and breast cancer models using sensitive (HT29) and resistant (SW620, LS174t, MDA231) cell lines. In vivo, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and safety studies were performed in rodents. Finally, efficacy was evaluated using two tumor-bearing mice models (LS174 and MDA231) with response and survival as main endpoints. RESULTS: LipoFufol is a 120-nm pegylated liposome, displaying 20-30% encapsulation rates. In vitro, antiproliferative activities were higher than 5-FU, and matched that of FolFox combination in colorectal models, but not in breast. Drug monitoring showed an optimized pharmacokinetics profile with reduced clearance and prolonged half-life. Liposome accumulation in tumors was shown by fluorescence-based biodistribution studies. Beside, milder neutropenia was observed when giving LipoFufol to animals with transient partial DPD-deficiency, as compared with standard 5-FU. In LS174t-bearing mice, higher response and 55% longer survival were achieved with Lipofufol, as compared with 5-FU. CONCLUSION: The issues of drug-resistance and drug-related toxicity can be both addressed using a stealth liposomal formulation of modulated 5-FU.

17934329|t|In vivo and in vitro skin permeation of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane from lipospheres.
17934329|a|Lipid microparticles (lipospheres) loaded with butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), a widely used UV-A sunscreen agent, were prepared by melt technique and evaluated for skin permeation both in vivo, by tape stripping method, and in vitro, by a flow-through diffusion chamber. Following in vivo human skin application of an O/W emulsion containing 2% of BMDBM loaded in lipospheres, 15% of the applied sunscreen accumulated in the uppermost layers of the stratum corneum without remarkably modifying the skin permeation of the unencapsulated sunscreen. These results were found to be predicted by an in vitro methodology involving the diffusion of BMDBM through a lipophilized synthetic membrane into a hydrophilic receptor phase, simulating the viable epidermis better than an ethanolic receptor phase.

24158024|t|What research is being done on prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in the Russian research community?
24158024|a|AIMS: Although Russia has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable burden of disease, little is known about the existing research on prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) in this country. The objective of this study was to locate and review published and unpublished studies related to any aspect of PAE and FASD conducted in or using study populations from Russia. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple English and Russian electronic bibliographic databases. In addition, a manual search was conducted in several major libraries in Moscow. RESULTS: The search revealed a small pool of existing research studies related to PAE and/or FASD in Russia (126: 22 in English and 104 in Russian). Existing epidemiological data indicate a high prevalence of PAE and FASD, which underlines the strong negative impact that alcohol has on mortality, morbidity and disability in Russia. High levels of alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age, low levels of contraception use, and low levels of knowledge by health and other professionals regarding the harmful effects of PAE put this country at great risk of further alcohol-affected pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol preventive measures in Russia warrant immediate attention. More research focused on alcohol prevention and policy is needed in order to reduce alcohol-related harm, especially in the field of FASD.

19035976|t|Adalimumab for Crohn's disease with intolerance or lost response to infliximab: a 3-year single-centre experience.
19035976|a|BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with Crohn's disease who lost response or became intolerant to infliximab. AIM: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab as a second line therapy in luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. METHODS: We report our single-centre experience in 53 patients. We evaluated maintenance of clinical response defined as the absence of adverse events leading to drug withdrawal, no major abdominal surgery and no loss of clinical response in initial responders. Major abdominal surgery, steroid sparing, complete fistula closure and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The probability of maintaining clinical response was 77.2%, 67.8% and 50.8% at 26, 52 and 130 weeks respectively. The probability of remaining major abdominal surgery-free was 82.3% at 26, 52 and 130 weeks. Complete fistula closure occurred in six of 10 patients, and eight of 10 patients were able to taper steroid therapy. Adverse events occurred in 31 patients (58.5%) leading to adalimumab withdrawal in nine patients (17%). CONCLUSION: Adalimumab therapy may be effective in the long term in both luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease in infliximab-failure patients, half of patients maintaining clinical response and potentially avoiding major abdominal surgery in 80% of cases.

1600269|a|We report two hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers who had liver failure after withdrawal of corticosteroids (steroids) administered for treatment of serious asthmatic attacks. Liver functions deteriorated 1 to 2 wk after withdrawal of the steroid therapy and liver failure occurred. Steroid readministration and intensive therapy for liver failure did not prevent death. An excessive immune response provoked by steroid withdrawal and decreased reserve capacity due to underlying chronic liver disease were thought to be factors in the liver failure. Caution must be exercised in the administration of steroids to patients with underlying chronic HBV infection to prevent exacerbation of hepatitis. Prompt readministration of steroids is indicated if evidence of liver failure develops.

21884027|t|Chronic pretreatment of metformin is associated with the reduction of the no-reflow phenomenon in patients with diabetes mellitus after primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction.
21884027|a|INTRODUCTION: Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the effect of metformin on no-reflow in diabetic patients. AIM: In this study, we investigated retrospectively whether chronic pretreatment with metformin was associated with no-reflow in diabetic patients who underwent primary coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). RESULTS: A total of 154 consecutive diabetic patients who underwent primary angioplasty for a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were studied. No-reflow was defined as a final TIMI flow of  <=2 or final TIMI flow of 3 with a myocardial blush grade of <2. The no-reflow phenomenon was found in 53 of 154 patients. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the patients with and without metformin pretreatment. However, the 65 patients receiving chronic metformin treatment before admission had lower incidence of the no-reflow than those without it (4.2 and 14.6%, P < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that absence of metformin pretreatment was a significant predictor of the no-reflow along with high-burden thrombus, ejection fraction on admission and anterior AMI. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that chronic pretreatment with metformin may be associated with the reduction of the no-reflow phenomenon in patients with diabetes mellitus after primary angioplasty for AMI.

23175462|a|Although the employment of biomedical colloids is not new, modern biomedical colloids, termed nanomedicines and nanodiagnostics, have enhanced functionality, in that the drug compound/diagnostic probe entrapped within the nanoparticle takes on the properties of the encapsulating nanoparticle. The nanoparticle's properties are specifically dictated by its size, shape, and surface chemistry; the net result in the case of medicines is an alteration of the drug's intrinsic pharmacokinetics and eventual drug targeting to the areas of pathology. The first nanomedicines, which really altered the pharmacokinetics of a drug molecule, were licensed in the early-to-mid 1990s. Since this time, these pioneering nanomedicines: liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) and liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome), have been followed by medicines such as albumin-stabilised paclitaxel (Abraxane) and biomedical sentinel lymph node nanodiagnostics such as Sienna+. The clinical trials database is heavily populated with nanosystem trials--an indication that these agents are growing in stature and will be utilised in an expanding list of clinical situations. Although the intravenous route is the route of choice for the current nanoparticles, new administration routes such as the pulmonary route are already in clinical testing, and researchers are working on the preclinical development of oral nanomedicines.

16805767|t|Presynaptic enzymatic neurotoxins.
16805767|a|Botulinum neurotoxins produced by anaerobic bacteria of the genus Clostridium are the most toxic proteins known, with mouse LD50 values in the 1-5 ng/kg range, and are solely responsible for the pathophysiology of botulism. These metalloproteinases enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals and cleave proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus, causing a persistent, but reversible, inhibition of neurotransmitter release. They are used in the therapy of many human syndromes caused by hyperactive nerve terminals. Snake presynaptic PLA2 neurotoxins block nerve terminals by binding to the nerve membrane and catalyzing phospholipid hydrolysis with production of lysophospholipids and fatty acids. These compounds change the membrane conformation, causing enhanced fusion of synaptic vesicle via hemifusion intermediate with release of neurotransmitter and, at the same time, inhibition of vesicle fission and recycling. It is possible to envisage clinical applications of the lysophospholipid/fatty acid mixture to inhibit hyperactive superficial nerve terminals.

1495698|t|Quadruplet pregnancy: contemporary management and outcome.
1495698|a|Quadruplets are occurring more frequently as assisted-reproduction techniques improve fertility in couples previously unable to conceive. Ten quadruplet pregnancies cared for in one perinatal practice over 5 years had excellent outcome. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.5 weeks, compared with approximately 30 weeks in the literature. There were no perinatal deaths and no long-term morbidity. Our patients were compared with a series of 57 consecutive patients with quadruplet pregnancies monitored by a home monitoring system. Parity of 1 or more appeared to improve outcome. Pregnancy-induced hypertension occurred in nine of our pregnancies and necessitated delivery in seven instances. Fetal distress was responsible for two deliveries and uncontrollable preterm labor for only one. Key points in our management protocol include prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin, home contraction monitoring, use of terbutaline pump tocolysis, and bed rest at home starting at 16 weeks.

18191555|t|Nortriptyline hydrochloride skin absorption: development of a transdermal patch.
18191555|a|The influence of propylen glycol (PG), ethanol, and oleic acid (OA) on nortriptyline hydrochloride (NTH) penetration through human epidermis was studied in vitro at two different pH values (5.5 and 7.4). The influence of lactic acid and polysorbate 80 was studied for a pH of 5.5. Permeation studies through Heat Separated Epidermis, as well as the enhancing effect of the different vehicles, showed a pH dependency. A pH value of 5.5 in the donor solution decreases significantly the permeability coefficient (Kp) with respect to a pH value of 7.4 (0.011+/-0.004 x 10(-6) versus 0.36+/-0.04 x 10(-6)cm/s). The vehicles showed an increasing enhancement effect in the order: polysorbate 80>ethanol/PG/OA>PG>ethanol>ethanol/lactic acid>lactic acid at pH 5.5 while they reduced the permeation of NTH at pH 7.4. Considering the results obtained at pH 5.5, the maximum enhancement ratios were found for polysorbate 80 and the combination ethanol/PG/OA (10.72 and 3.90). Both vehicles were selected for designing a NTH transdermal delivery system (NTH-TDS) using (hydroxypropyl)methyl-cellulose as polymer. The NTH-TDS based on the combination of ethanol/PG/OA showed an enhancement ratio with respect to control of 2.09 and the addition of polysorbate 80 to the matrix, of 5.82.

2149049|t|A comparative efficacy and safety study of teicoplanin plus aztreonam versus gentamicin plus piperacillin in haematology oncology patients with clinically diagnosed septicaemia.
2149049|a|Infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci, have been increasing in immunocompromised patients during the last 5 years because of an increased use of Hickman catheters and oral gut decontamination with quinolones. Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, has a long plasma half-life which allows once-a-day bolus administration, making it a 'user friendly' agent. A randomized comparative evaluation of teicoplanin plus aztreonam versus gentamicin plus piperacillin in leukaemic patients with a clinical diagnosis of septicaemia was undertaken. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teicoplanin and aztreonam in comparison to a 'standard antibiotic' regimen and (2) to assess the local and systemic tolerance of these drugs. Results of the study in more than 70 patients to date are presented, and the role of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics in the management of severe sepsis in immunocompromised patients is discussed.

17522334|t|Activity of VNP40101M (Cloretazine) in the treatment of CNS tumor xenografts in athymic mice.
17522334|a|VNP40101M, or 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-choloroethyl)-2-(methylamino)carbonylhydrazine (Cloretazine), is a bifunctional prodrug that belongs to a class of DNA-modifying agents-the sulfonylhydrazines-that has been synthesized and been shown to have activity against a wide spectrum of xenografts. The current study was designed to assess the activity of VNP40101M administered at a dose of 18 mg/kg daily for five days against a panel of human adult and pediatric CNS tumors growing subcutaneously or intracranially in athymic nude mice. The results demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth delays of 15.0, 8.3, 51.0, 60+, 60+, and 60+ days in subcutaneous xenografts derived from childhood glioblastoma multiforme (D-456 MG), childhood ependymoma (D-528 EP and D-612 EP), childhood medulloblastoma (D-425 MED), and adult malignant glioma (D-245 MG and D-54 MG), respectively, with corresponding tumor regressions in 10 of 10, 4 of 10, 8 of 10, 9 of 10, 9 of 10, and 10 of 10 treated mice, respectively. Delayed toxicity was seen more than 60 days after treatment, with 23 deaths in 100 treated animals, despite a median weight loss of only 0.06%. In mice bearing intracranial D-245 MG xenografts, treatment with VNP40101M at a dose of 18 mg/kg daily for five days produced a 50% increase in median survival compared with controls. Additional experiments conducted against subcutaneous D-245 MG xenografts by using reduced doses of 13.5 or 9.0 mg/kg daily for five days demonstrated tumor growth delays of 82.2 and 53.5 days, with corresponding tumor regressions in 8 of 9 and 9 of 10 treated mice, respectively (all values, p < 0.001), with one toxic death. These findings suggest that VNP40101M is active in the treatment of a wide range of human central nervous system tumors and warrants translation to the clinic.

23442310|t|Adequacy of vitamin D intakes in children and teenagers from the base diet, fortified foods and supplements.
23442310|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe vitamin D intakes in children and teenagers and the contribution from supplements and fortified foods in addition to the base diet. DESIGN: Analysis of 7 d weighed food records collected during the Children's and Teens' National Nutrition Surveys in Ireland. Food composition data for vitamin D were updated from international analytical sources. SETTING: Nationally representative cross-sectional dietary surveys. SUBJECTS: Children (n 594; 5-12 years) and teenagers (n 441; 13-17 years). RESULTS: Median vitamin D intakes were 1.9, 2.1 and 2.4 µg/d in 5-8-, 9-12- and 13-17-year-olds, respectively. The prevalence of vitamin D-containing supplement use was 21, 16 and 15% in 5-8-, 9-12- and 13-17-year-olds and median intakes in users ranged from 6.0 to 6.7 µg/d. The prevalence of inadequate intakes, defined as the percentage with mean daily intakes below the Estimated Average Requirement of 10 µg/d, ranged from 88 to 96% in supplement users. Foods fortified with vitamin D, mainly breakfast cereals, fat spreads and milk, were consumed by 71, 70 and 63 % of 5-8-, 9-12- and 13-17-year-olds. Non-supplement users who consumed vitamin D-fortified foods had median intakes of 1.9-2.5 µg/d, compared with 1.2-1.4 µg/d in those who did not consume fortified foods. CONCLUSIONS: It is currently not possible for children consuming the habitual diet to meet the US Institute of Medicine dietary reference intake for vitamin D. In the absence of nationally representative 25-hydroxyvitamin D data in children, the implications of this observation for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and health consequences are speculative.

14565868|t|Clustering of the B cell receptor is not required for the apoptotic response.
14565868|a|We examined the role of BCR cell membrane redistribution in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis in three human B cell lines, RA#1, 2G6, and MC116, that differ in their relative levels of sIgM expression. The apoptotic response was found to be dependent on the nature of the anti-IgM and the cell line. In the cell lines, RA#1 and MC116, sIgM aggregated into patches that were insensitive to the disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by nystatin or beta-MCD. The B cell line 2G6 was able to reorganize sIgM into a tight coalescent cap upon anti-IgM treatment. However, in this case, the lipid raft inhibitors nystatin and beta-MCD disrupted the patching. In 2G6 cells, BCR-mediated apoptosis was not affected by nystatin treatment, whereas it increased in beta-MCD pretreated cells. Thus, no evident correlation was found between apoptosis and BCR cell membrane redistribution or lipid raft formation in either of the three cell lines. The data indicate that the apoptotic signal transduction pathway is independent of BCR translocation into lipid rafts and/or aggregation.

9371520|t|The role of Cdc2 feedback loop control in the DNA damage checkpoint in mammalian cells.
9371520|a|DNA damage inactivates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and arrests the cell cycle. Following DNA damage, the G1-S CDKs are inhibited by a mechanism involving p53-dependent induction of p21Cip1/Waf1; but how the Cdc2 is inhibited is less apparent. We found that the signal generated by the DNA damage checkpoint in G2 was dominant over that from the spindle microtubule-assembly checkpoint, because the high Cdc2 activity present in nocodazole or Taxol-arrested cells was reduced by DNA damage. Phosphorylation of the inhibitory residues in Cdc2, Thr14, and Tyr15 coincided with the inactivation of Cdc2 after DNA damage. Interpretation of this result, however, was not straightforward due to the regulation of Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation by feedback loops; hence, their phosphorylation can in principle result merely from the inhibition of Cdc2 activity. Consistent with this, Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation was induced when Cdc2 kinase activity was inhibited with butyrolactone-I. Given these complications, we undertook a more critical analysis of the mechanisms that regulate Cdc2 after DNA damage. Caffeine reversed the DNA damage-induced inhibition of Cdc2 by causing dephosphorylation of Cdc2, and this dephosphorylation still occurred even when the Cdc2 feedback loops were blocked with butyrolactone-I. These data suggest that the DNA damage checkpoint in part acts through Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation by a mechanism independent of Cdc2 activity, and this phosphorylation can be accentuated by the Cdc2 feedback loops involving Thr14/Tyr15 protein kinases and phosphatases. The kinase activity of the Wee1Hu Tyr15 protein kinase was unaltered after DNA damage, but the phosphatase activity of Cdc25C was reduced. Thus, the decrease in Cdc25C activity may in part account for the DNA damage-induced increase in Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation.

20121287|t|Variant VKORC1 and CYP2C9 alleles in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage caused by oral anticoagulants.
20121287|a|BACKGROUND: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening bleeding complication that can occur as a result of oral anticoagulation therapy. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that in patients treated with coumarins, alveolar hemorrhage is associated with vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) variant alleles. In addition, in the case of acenocoumarol use, CYP2C19 allelic variants also play a role. METHODS: During a 7-year period, data on patients using coumarins with confirmed DAH were gathered. Of 173 confirmed DAH cases, 75 received oral anticoagulants, and 63 (84%) of these 75 patients were included because their DNA was available. For genotyping the CYP2C9*2 (430C>T), CYP2C9*3 (1075A>C), CYP2C19*2 (681G>A), CYP2C19*3 (636G>A), VKORC1 (-1639G>A), and VKORC1 (1173C>T) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), real-time PCRs were performed. RESULTS: In 62 (98.4%) of 63 patients with DAH, variant alleles were found. In 51 (81.0%) of the 63 patients, VKORC1 allelic variants (20 homozygotes and 31 heterozygotes) were present. In 31 (49.2%) of the 63 DAH cases, CYP2C9 allelic variants (three homozygotes, 26 heterozygotes, and two compound heterozygotes) were observed, and in 20 (32.0%) of the 63 patients, variant alleles of both genes were observed. CONCLUSION: Genotyping of four SNPs for VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms is useful in predicting a high probability of the occurrence of DAH in patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Early and timely use of genotyping is recommended to prevent a fatal outcome and to provide safer and more individualized anticoagulant therapy.

10212915|t|Bilateral Wilms' tumor: a clinicopathologic review.
10212915|a|Bilateral Wilms' tumor occurs at a younger age than unilateral disease. While it generally has a good prognosis, it presents a therapeutic dilemma to balance curative surgical resection with preservation of renal tissue. A 15 year review of bilateral Wilms' tumors diagnosed at Princess Margaret Hospital was undertaken. Of 46 Wilms' tumor cases, eight were designated bilateral by diagnostic imaging (median age 1.1 years compared with 3.5 years for unilateral tumors). The surgical management entailed primary nephrectomy with contralateral biopsy in two patients, and bilateral biopsy and delayed resection in all remaining surviving patients (one patient died of perioperative complications). Seven patients had localized disease (stage I/II) and the six surviving patients received chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin; no patient received radiotherapy. All are alive and well (median follow-up 5.1 years). The remaining patient presented with pulmonary metastases and died of disease progression. Pathologic review revealed that four patients had truly bilateral disease demonstrable by histology, three had unilateral Wilms' tumor with contralateral nephrogenic rests, and in one patient the biopsies of the contralateral kidney showed neither tumor nor nephrogenic rests. In most cases pathological material was subject to external review. Follow-up demonstrates excellent renal function with compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining renal tissue. Conservative surgery and simple out-patient based, low toxicity chemotherapy is curative in most patients.

9804172|t|Promoter activation and following induction of the p21/WAF1 gene by flavone is involved in G1 phase arrest in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.
9804172|a|Flavonoids are present in many plants including edible fruits and vegetables. Recently, many of the biological activities of flavonoids have been elucidated. Flavone is a well known flavonoid, and many of its derivatives have been shown to have anti-proliferative effects on several cancer cells. We report here that flavone can effectively inhibit the cell growth of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and 100 microM flavone causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. As a mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest, flavone markedly increases the mRNA and protein levels of a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p21/WAF1, and inhibits phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Although A549 cells possess wild-type p53, flavone does not induce the p53 protein, suggesting that p21/WAF1 induction is p53-independent. In addition, 100 microM flavone significantly increases the promoter activity of the p21/WAF1 gene by 5-fold. These results suggest that the G1 phase arrest by flavone is due to p53-independent transcriptional induction of the p21/WAF1 gene and the subsequent dephosphorylation of RB protein.

21967703|t|Limiting hepatitis C virus progression in liver transplant recipients using sirolimus-based immunosuppression.
21967703|a|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes progressive liver fibrosis in liver transplant recipients and is the principal cause of long-term allograft failure. The antifibrotic effects of sirolimus are seen in animal models but have not been described in liver transplant recipients. We reviewed 1274 liver recipients from 2002 to 2010 and identified a cohort of HCV recipients exposed to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression (SRL Cohort) and an HCV Control Group of recipients who had never received sirolimus. Yearly protocol biopsies were done recording fibrosis stage (METAVIR score) with biopsy compliance of >80% at both year one and two. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the SRL Cohort had significantly less advanced fibrosis (stage >= 2) compared to the HCV Control Group at year one (15.3% vs. 36.2%, p < 0.0001) and year two (30.1% vs. 50.5%, p = 0.001). Because sirolimus is sometimes discontinued for side effects, the SRL Cohort was subgroup stratified for sirolimus duration, showing progressively less fibrosis with longer sirolimus duration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated sirolimus as an independent predictor of minimal fibrosis at year one, and year two. This is the first study among liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV to describe the positive impact of sirolimus in respect of reduced fibrosis extent and rate of progression.

9630643|t|The genotoxic hazards of domestic wastes in surface waters.
9630643|a|Despite the noteworthy genotoxic potency of many industrial wastewaters, the genotoxic hazard posed to the downstream ecosystem and its associated biota will be determined by genotoxic loading. Municipal wastewaters, although ranking low in potency, can achieve loading values that are several orders of magnitude greater than those of most industries. Although these wastewaters are generally mixtures of wastes from several different sources, the volumetric proportion of the daily discharge that is of industrial origin rarely exceeds 30%. Genotoxicity calculations for the Montreal Urban Community (MUC) municipal wastewater treatment facility indicate that over 90% of the genotoxic loading (31.1 kg benzo(a)pyrene equivalents per day) is nonindustrial in origin. Moreover, a mass balance of surface water genotoxicity for St. Lawrence river at Montreal indicates that over 85% of the total contributions from the Montreal region are nonindustrial in origin. Additional calculations for the Great Lakes, and other rivers throughout the world, provide further support of a strong relationship between surface water genotoxicity and population. Despite some information about physical/chemical properties, the identity of the putative genotoxins in municipal wastewaters and surface waters remains a mystery. Likely candidates include potent genotoxins, such as N-nitroso compounds and aromatic amines, known to be present in human sanitary wastes, as well as genotoxic PAHs known to be present in many municipal wastewaters. Calculations based on literature data indicate that human sanitary wastes may be able to account for a substantial fraction (4-70%) of the nonindustrial loading from municipal wastewaters. Similar calculations suggest that pyrogenic PAHs that enter municipal wastewaters via surface runoff can only account for a small fraction (<5%) of the genotoxic loading values discussed.

19858202|t|Cannabinoid receptor type 1- and 2-mediated increase in cyclic AMP inhibits T cell receptor-triggered signaling.
19858202|a|The aim of this study was to characterize inhibitory mechanisms on T cell receptor signaling mediated by the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Both receptors are coupled to G(i/o) proteins, which are associated with inhibition of cyclic AMP formation. In human primary and Jurkat T lymphocytes, activation of CB1 by R(+)-methanandamide, CB2 by JWH015, and both by Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol induced a short decrease in cyclic AMP lasting less than 1 h. However, this decrease was followed by a massive (up to 10-fold) and sustained (at least up to 48 h) increase in cyclic AMP. Mediated by the cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase A and C-terminal Src kinase, the cannabinoids induced a stable phosphorylation of the inhibitory Tyr-505 of the leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck). By thus arresting Lck in its inhibited form, the cannabinoids prevented the dephosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-505 in response to T cell receptor activation, which is necessary for the subsequent initiation of T cell receptor signaling. In this way the cannabinoids inhibited the T cell receptor-triggered signaling, i.e. the activation of the zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa, the linker for activation of T cells, MAPK, the induction of interleukin-2, and T cell proliferation. All of the effects of the cannabinoids were blocked by the CB1 and CB2 antagonists AM281 and AM630. These findings help to better understand the immunosuppressive effects of cannabinoids and explain the beneficial effects of these drugs in the treatment of T cell-mediated autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis.

22646774|t|Appropriate management of cutaneous adverse events maximizes compliance with sorafenib treatment: a single-center experience.
22646774|a|AIMS: This report describes a positive experience of adverse event (AE) management of a multidisciplinary clinical team and 18 patients with late-stage renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma attending the Day Hospital Unit of the 'Centro Catanese di Oncologia Humanitas' (Italy) over a 2-year period. METHODS: The management strategy was based on preventive measures for reducing the development of cutaneous AEs, including pain, risk of infection and patient discomfort, while avoiding the discontinuation or the reduction of the sorafenib dosage. RESULTS: As of July 2011, eight patients were still under treatment with sorafenib; seven patients experienced cutaneous AEs and two reported severe cutaneous AEs. CONCLUSION: Our treatment approach seemed to reduce the incidence and/or severity of AEs, keeping patients in treatment, which is essential for good treatment outcomes.

15030300|t|Reactive oxygen species in vascular biology: role in arterial hypertension.
15030300|a|The cellular metabolism of oxygen generates potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. Under normal physiologic conditions, the rate and magnitude of oxidant formation is balanced by the rate of oxidant elimination. However, an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative stress, which is the pathogenic outcome of the overproduction of oxidants that overwhelms the cellular antioxidant capacity. There is growing evidence that increased oxidative stress and associated oxidative damage are mediators of vascular injury in cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion. This development has evoked considerable interest because of the possibilities that therapies targeted against reactive oxygen intermediates by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species and/or by increasing availability of antioxidants may be useful in minimizing vascular injury. This review focuses on the vascular actions of reactive oxygen species, the role of oxidative stress in vascular damage in hypertension and the therapeutic potential of modulating oxygen radical bioavailability in hypertension. In particular, the following topics will be highlighted: chemistry and sources of reactive oxygen species, antioxidant defense mechanisms, signaling events mediated by reactive oxygen species, role of reactive oxygen species in hypertension and the putative therapeutic role of antioxidants in cardiovascular disease.

7970117|t|Effects of histamine on inositol phosphates and intracellular Ca2+ in human glomerular epithelial cells.
7970117|a|The effect of histamine on the phosphoinositide turnover and intracellular free calcium activity [Ca2+]i was examined in human glomerular epithelial cells in culture. Addition of histamine to glomerular epithelial cells resulted in formation of inositol phosphates in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A transient maximum of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) was observed within 10 s. Stimulation of protein kinase C by short-term pretreatment (15 min) of glomerular epithelial cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the histamine-induced inositol phosphate accumulation. The baseline of [Ca2+]i in the cells was 115 +/- 2.7 nmol/l (n = 103). Histamine (ED50: approx. 2 x 10(-7) mol/l) caused a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i as detected by fura-2 microfluorimetry studies. In a calcium-free extracellular solution the rapid increase of [Ca2+]i was still present. The H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (IC50: approx. 8 x 10(-9) mol/l) inhibited the histamine (10(-6) mol/l) response on [Ca2+]i. Cimetidine, a potent H2 receptor antagonist, showed no effect. This data indicates that H1 receptor activation causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C activation, and consecutive mobilization of intracellular calcium. Since histamine is a mediator of inflammation, antigen response and cellular injury, these findings could be of importance for the understanding of glomerular epithelial cell pathology.

23461283|t|Effect of prophylactic intraocular pressure-lowering medication on pain during cataract surgery.
23461283|a|PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effects of acetazolamide, latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, brimonidine, brinzolamide, and timolol on pain during phacoemulsification cataract surgery. METHODS: This prospective randomized comparative study included 323 eyes of 323 patients with no history of intraocular surgery or chronic eye disease who underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery and foldable intraocular lens implantation under topical anesthesia. Patients were divided into 8 groups according to the preoperative prophylactic intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication. The intraoperative pain was assessed postoperatively using a visual analog pain scale. The Kruskal-Wallis test investigated the differences in the visual analog pain-scale scores of the groups, and the Mann-Whitney U test investigated the pairwise comparison of the groups. RESULTS: The median visual analog pain-scale score of the group that did not receive any IOP-lowering medication was 2.0 ±1.89. The brimonidine group exhibited the lowest visual analog pain-scale scores, and the prostanoids, especially the bimatoprost group, demonstrated the highest visual analog pain-scale scores (median ±standard deviation were 0.0 ±1.50 and 2.0 ±1.91, respectively). The median visual analog pain-scale scores of the acetazolamide, latanoprost, travoprost, brinzolamide, and timolol groups were 0.0 ±1.62, 2.0 ±1.67, 2.0 ±1.73, 0.0 ±1.66, and 1.0 ±1.54, respectively. A pairwise comparison using the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction revealed significant differences between the groups of acetozolamide and travoprost (p=0.001), acetozolamide and bimatoprost (p<0.001), travoprost and brimonidine (p<0.001), bimatoprost and brimonidine (p<0.001), and bimatoprost and timolol (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic application of the IOP-lowering medication may alter the pain sensation during phacoemulsification cataract surgery.

15326073|t|Early statin treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: demonstration of the beneficial effect on atherosclerotic lesions by serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound analysis during half a year after coronary event: the ESTABLISH Study.
15326073|a|BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that aggressive lipid lowering by statins could prevent recurrent events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We hypothesized that this efficacy was caused by a significant reduction in plaque volume by aggressive LDL cholesterol (LCL-C) lowering. The present study investigated the effect of early statin treatment on plaque volume of a nonculprit lesion by serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound in patients with ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients with ACS were enrolled. All patients underwent emergency coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). They were randomized to intensive lipid-lowering therapy (n=35; atorvastatin 20 mg/d) or control (n=35) groups after PCI. Volumetric intravascular ultrasound analyses were performed at baseline and 6-month follow-up for a non-PCI site in 48 patients (atorvastatin, n=24; control, n=24). LDL-C level was significantly decreased by 41.7% in the atorvastatin group compared with the control group, in which LDL-C was increased by 0.7% (P<0.0001). Plaque volume was significantly reduced in the atorvastatin group (13.1+/-12.8% decrease) compared with the control group (8.7+/-14.9% increase; P<0.0001). Percent change in plaque volume showed a significant positive correlation with follow-up LDL-C level (R=0.456, P=0.0011) and percent LDL-C reduction (R=0.612, P<0.0001), even in patients with baseline LDL-C <125 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Early aggressive lipid-lowering therapy by atorvastatin for 6 months significantly reduced the plaque volume in patients with ACS. Percent change in plaque volume showed a significant positive correlation with percent LDL-C reduction, even in patients with low baseline LDL-C.

23290780|t|Therapeutic potential of targeting SK1 in human cancers.
23290780|a|Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) is a lipid enzyme with oncogenic properties that converts the proapoptotic lipids ceramide and sphingosine into the antiapoptotic lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate and activates the signal transduction pathways that lead to cell proliferation, migration, the activation of the inflammatory response, and the impairment of apoptosis. There is compelling evidence that SK1 activation contributes to cancer progression leading to increased oncogenic transformation, tumor growth, resistance to therapies, tumor neovascularization, and metastatic spread. High levels of SK1 expression or activity have been associated with a poor prognosis in several human cancers. Recent studies using cancer cell and mouse models demonstrate a significant potential for SK1-targeting therapies to synergize with the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; however, until recently the absence of clinically applicable SK1 inhibitors has limited the translation of these findings into patients. With the recent discovery of SK1 inhibiting properties of a clinically approved drug FTY720 (Fingolimod), SK1 has gained significant attention from both clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry and it is hoped that trials of newly developed SK1 inhibitors may follow soon. This review provides an overview of the SK1 signaling, its relevance to cancer progression, and the potential clinical significance of targeting SK1 for improved local or systemic control of human cancers.

22184422|t|The antibacterial activity of LL-37 against Treponema denticola is dentilisin protease independent and facilitated by the major outer sheath protein virulence factor.
22184422|a|Host defense peptides are innate immune effectors that possess both bactericidal activities and immunomodulatory functions. Deficiency in the human host defense peptide LL-37 has previously been correlated with severe periodontal disease. Treponema denticola is an oral anaerobic spirochete closely associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The T. denticola major surface protein (MSP), involved in adhesion and cytotoxicity, and the dentilisin serine protease are key virulence factors of this organism. In this study, we examined the interactions between LL-37 and T. denticola. The three T. denticola strains tested were susceptible to LL-37. Dentilisin was found to inactivate LL-37 by cleaving it at the Lys, Phe, Gln, and Val residues. However, dentilisin deletion did not increase the susceptibility of T. denticola to LL-37. Furthermore, dentilisin activity was found to be inhibited by human saliva. In contrast, a deficiency of the T. denticola MSP increased resistance to LL-37. The MSP-deficient mutant bound less fluorescently labeled LL-37 than the wild-type strain. MSP demonstrated specific, dose-dependent LL-37 binding. In conclusion, though capable of LL-37 inactivation, dentilisin does not protect T. denticola from LL-37. Rather, the rapid, MSP-mediated binding of LL-37 to the treponemal outer sheath precedes cleavage by dentilisin. Moreover, in vivo, saliva inhibits dentilisin, thus preventing LL-37 restriction and ensuring its bactericidal and immunoregulatory activities.

20606042|t|New role of (-)-epicatechin in enhancing the induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by curcumin.
20606042|a|Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa (Linn), is ingested every day in the Indian subcontinent and is well reported to possess cancer-preventive activity. To achieve effective cancer prevention with curcumin, we need to find a new method to enhance the effects of curcumin in the diet. Based on our evidence that (-)-epicatechin (EC), an inert catechin, enhances the cancer-preventive activity of green tea catechins, we studied the enhancing effects of EC on inductions of growth inhibition and apoptosis in human lung cancer cell lines PC-9 and A549 with curcumin. The combination of curcumin with EC significantly increased the inhibition of cell growth compared with curcumin or EC alone. The combination similarly increased both apoptosis and expression of GADD153 and GADD45 genes, associated with their enhanced protein production. Knockdown of GADD153 or GADD45 by small interfering RNA abrogated the apoptosis induction and growth inhibition induced by the combination, indicating the crucial role of their upregulation. Treatments of PC-9 cells with c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase inhibitor SP600125, with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB202190 and with PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor) all increased the upregulation of GADD153 and GADD45 genes by the combination. Because EC was previously shown to enhance the incorporation of EGCG into PC-9 cells, we think that EC has similar effects on curcumin. This report is the first report on the enhancing effects of EC on curcumin, and the data suggest that EC plays a significant role in the enhancement of the cancer-preventive activity of curcumin in the diet.

16647406|t|A multicenter study of the outcome of biliary atresia in the United States, 1997 to 2000.
16647406|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic factors and optimal approaches to the diagnosis and management of biliary atresia, the leading indication for liver transplantation in children. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed of all children who underwent hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) for biliary atresia between 1997 and 2000 at 9 centers in the United States. Outcome at age 24 months was correlated with demographic and clinical parameters. RESULTS: A total of 104 children underwent HPE; 25% had congenital anomalies, and outcome was worse in those with biliary atresia splenic malformation syndrome. Diagnostic and clinical approaches varied, although specific approaches did not appear to correlate with outcome. The average age at referral was 53 days, and the average age at HPE was 61 days. At age 24 months, 58 children were alive with their native liver, 42 had undergone liver transplantation (37 alive, 5 dead), and 4 had died without undergoing transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival without liver transplantation revealed markedly improved survival in children with total bilirubin level<2 mg/dL at 3 months after HPE (84% vs 16%; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Outcome in the study centers was equivalent to that reported in other countries. Total bilirubin in early follow-up after HPE was highly predictive of outcome.

11295088|t|Pharmacokinetics of intraoperative intrapleural cisplatin chemotherapy of various osmolarities in cases of esophageal cancer.
11295088|a|Intraoperative intrapleural (i.pl.) cisplatin (CDDP) treatment during thoracotomy was performed for esophageal cancers. Three patients underwent isotonic (308 mOsm/l) CDDP treatment. Hypotonic CDDP treatments with a 154 mOsm/l solution and a 62 mOsm/l solution were administered to 4 and 9 patients, respectively. The maximum concentrations (Cmax) of both total and filterable platinum in the plasma after injection of the hypotonic solution were significantly higher than those after injection of the isotonic solution. The area under the curve of concentration versus time (AUC) of the plasma of the 62 mOsm/l solution was significantly higher than that of the 154 mOsm/l and isotonic solution. Although higher levels of the Cmax may increase side-effects, the hypotonic condition of the i.pl. fluid and increased AUC in the plasma may escalate the accumulation of platinum in i.pl. cancer cells. These results suggest that hypotonic i.pl. CDDP is tolerable and may be useful for treatment of the incipient phase of pleural carcinomatosis and for prophylaxis of postoperative recurrence.

11178339|t|Anti-anaerobic activity of antibacterial agents.
11178339|a|The first very effective bactericidal anti-anaerobic drug was metronidazole, introduced in clinical practice in the early 1980s. Sometimes penicillin G and chloramphenicol were used successfully in some anaerobic infections. However, this result was most likely due to Gram-positive anaerobic infections (e.g., Clostridium perfringens). Very rapidly, the anti-anaerobic armamentarium was extended with clindamycin, cefoxitin, imipenem and co-amoxyclav or piperacillin-tazobactam. The resistance rate to metronidazole and imipenem remains low but clindamycin has seen an importance decrease in bacterial susceptibility. New additional drugs could be very helpful to overcome resistance and adverse events. The novelties in this field are fluoroquinolones, which exhibit a good activity against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.

1643085|t|Steroid-induced perturbations of membranes and its relevance to sperm acrosome reaction.
1643085|a|The interaction of progesterone, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone and estradiol with membrane vesicles prepared from phosphatidylserine (PS), from the total lipids of human and hamster spermatozoa, from the lipids of hamster spermatozoal plasma and acrosomal membrane and with the native membranes of hamster spermatozoa have been investigated by 90 degrees light scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicate that progesterone decreases the fluidity of membranes, aggregates membrane vesicles, induces fusion of membrane vesicles and also renders them permeable to hydrophilic molecules like carboxyfluorescein. But, testosterone and estradiol at the same concentration had very little effect on membrane fluidity, membrane aggregation, fusion and leakage. The above membrane perturbing activities of the steroids is discussed in light of the recent findings that progesterone induces acrosome reaction in human and hamster spermatozoa [11,18].

11939442|t|Diclofenac or paracetamol for analgesia in paediatric myringotomy outpatients.
11939442|a|This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compared the analgesic efficacy of oral diclofenac resinate 0.5 mg.kg(-1) with paracetamol 15 mg/kg(-1) for control of postoperative pain in paediatric patients for outpatient bilateral myringotomy and tube insertion. Paracetamol, the most commonly used oral analgesic for paediatric patients, was compared with a new palatable syrup formulation of diclofenac. Sixty-three ASA 1 orA SA 2 children aged one year and above were randomly assigned to receive diclofenac (Group A) or paracetamol (Group B). The study drug was given 30 to 60 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with either inhalational sevoflurane or intravenous thiopentone. All subjects received intravenous fentanyl 1 microg/kg(-1) intraoperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed by a blinded observer using the CHEOPS score on eye-opening, and then at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Children with a CHEOPS score > 7 received further fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1). The number of cases requiring this "rescue" analgesia was recorded. Both groups were comparable in demographics, induction technique, duration of anaesthesia and time between premedication and induction of anaesthesia. Overall, CHEOPS scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time. Twenty per cent of the diclofenac group and 27% of the paracetamol group required rescue analgesia (not statistically significant). The efficacy of diclofenac 0.5 mg x kg(-1) and paracetamol 15 mg x kg(-1) as oral analgesic premedication for BMT was comparable in children receiving an anaesthetic which included intraoperative administration of fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1).

20721899|t|A case of occupational peritoneal mesothelioma from exposure to tremolite-free chrysotile in Quebec, Canada: A black swan case.
20721899|a|BACKGROUND: Tremolite contamination has been proposed as the cause of mesothelioma in workers exposed to commercial chrysotile. The asbestos industry and scientists it has sponsored, for example, have argued that commercial chrysotile does not cause peritoneal mesothelioma. METHOD: Case report of peritoneal mesothelioma in a mill worker from a tremolite free Canadian mine. RESULTS: Reports from pathology and occupational health and safety panels conclude that this mill worker developed work-related peritoneal mesothelioma. CONCLUSION: Chrysotile without tremolite can cause peritoneal mesothelioma.

16339614|t|Use of health care services among persons who screen positive for bipolar disorder.
16339614|a|OBJECTIVE: This study examined patterns of diagnosis, consultation, and treatment of persons who screened positive for bipolar disorder. METHODS: An impact survey was mailed to a representative subset of 3,059 individuals from a large U.S.-population-based study that utilized the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). RESULTS: Respondents who screened positive on the MDQ (reported the presence of seven of 13 symptoms of bipolar disorder, the co-occurrence of at least two symptoms, and moderate or severe symptom-related impairment) (N=1,167) had consulted a health care provider more often in the previous year than those who screened negative (reported six or fewer symptoms regardless of symptom co-occurrence or impairment) (N=1,283). Psychiatrists and primary care physicians failed to detect or misdiagnosed bipolar disorder among 53 percent and 78 percent of patients, respectively, who screened positive for bipolar disorder. The most commonly used psychotropic medications during the previous 12 months among those who screened positive were antidepressants alone (32 percent), followed by lithium and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (20 percent), antidepressants in combination with other psychotropics (19 percent), hypnotics (19 percent), and antipsychotics (9 percent). In the preceding 12 months, respondents who screened positive on the MDQ had greater use of psychiatric hospitals, emergency departments, and urgent care centers and also had more outpatient visits to primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and alcohol treatment centers than those who screened negative. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that bipolar disorder is an underdiagnosed and often inappropriately treated illness associated with significant use of health care resources.

1966003|t|Effect of Konjac food on blood glucose level in patients with diabetes.
1966003|a|Seventy-two type II diabetic subjects were given Konjac food for 65 days. The data analyzed by multiple F test indicate that the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and the 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG) on the 30th and the 65th days after the food was ingested were significantly reduced (P = 0.001, P less than 0.001, respectively), as was the glycosylated hemoglobin level at the end of the trial (P less than 0.05). The final FBG and PBG of the subjects with initial FBG-O greater than 200 mg% decreased on the average by 51.8 and 84.6 mg%, respectively; those with FBG-O 150-200 mg% decreased by 24.1 and 68.7 mg%; and those with FBG-O less than 150 mg% decreased by 4.8 and 21.4 mg%. No significant changes in blood lipid indexes were observed, except that the triglyceride values of subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 200 mg%) significantly decreased by 118.7 mg%. It was concluded that Konjac food is very useful in the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia.

23749733|t|Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients.
23749733|a|BACKGROUND: Pruritus is not the most prevalent but one of the most puzzling symptoms in palliative care patients. It can cause considerable discomfort and has a major impact on patients' quality of life. In the field of palliative care, pruritus is a symptom occurring in patients with disparate underlying diseases and based on different pathologic mechanisms but ending in the same phenomenon. The pathogenesis of pruritus is complex and not fully elucidated. Thus, it is still very difficult to treat pruritus effectively. Evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search up to January 2012 was performed and it was updated in August 2012. The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, DARE, CDSR) (2012, issue 8 of 12); MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012); EMBASE (1980 to August 2012) and three other databases. In addition, we searched trials registries and checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews, and websites, and contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care regarding unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments on preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed identified titles and abstracts. Three independent review authors performed assessment of all potentially relevant studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias and methodological quality. Results were summarised descriptively according to the different pharmacological interventions and the type of underlying pruritus. Where possible, results were presented in meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: In total, 38 reports comprising 40 studies and 1286 participants were included in the review. Altogether, 30 different treatments for pruritus in four different patient groups were included.The findings of this review indicated that the treatment of pruritus for palliative care patients is challenging and requires an individualistic approach. Results showed that effective therapeutic choices have to be guided by the pathophysiology of the pruritus. Various forms of pruritus occur, especially in the field of palliative care, and sometimes the origin of the pruritus is difficult to determine. Therefore, identifying the underlying cause of pruritus is of prime importance in order to develop tailored treatment plans, even if in palliative care the treatment is focused towards the symptom and not necessarily the underlying disease.Results show that in palliative care patients with pruritus of different natures, treatment with the drug paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, may be beneficial. For patients suffering from pruritus associated with HIV infection, indomethacin was described as the most effective drug, although the evidence was weak. For patients suffering from chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus, gabapentin may be an option. An alternative treatment for this patient group seems to be the k-opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine, which has shown significant amelioration of pruritus and acceptable adverse effects. As they have exhibited a low incidence of adverse effects, rifampicin and flumecinol  may be recommended for patients with cholestatic pruritus. The opioid antagonist naltrexone has been shown to offer a therapeutic alternative for patients suffering from uraemic or cholestatic pruritus. However, these drugs are often inappropriate in the palliative population because of the risk of reducing analgesia when giving high doses of naltrexone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review indicate that the number of systemic and topical drugs used for the different subforms of pruritus is increasing. Different interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of pruritus of different origins. Nevertheless, an optimal therapy for pruritus is constrained due to the limited understanding of crucial itch mediators and receptors in the various subforms of itch. Ideal antipruritic therapies are still lacking, especially for palliative care patients.This systematic review also indicates that there is insufficient evidence to give any concrete recommendations regarding treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients. Due to the very small sample sizes and poor methodological quality of the majority of studies that were included, the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the generalizability is questionable. Additional studies, and particularly carefully designed treatment trials, are needed to provide valid evidence for adequate treatment of pruritus in palliative care patients.

11772153|t|Tolerability profile of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents.
11772153|a|Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage.

1419444|t|Infusion of propofol to identify smallest effective doses for induction of anaesthesia in young and elderly patients.
1419444|a|We studied 110 patients older than 60 yr or aged 18-50 yr as separate groups in two stages to identify the smallest effective doses of propofol for induction of anaesthesia. In the elderly patients, in stage 1, at infusion rates of 25, 50 or 100 mg min-1 the mean (SD) doses administered were propofol 0.82 (0.14) mg kg-1, 1.22 (0.24) mg kg-1 and 1.65 (0.60) mg kg-1 and the induction times 140.1 (21.9) s, 103.2 (23.5) s and 69.4 (10.0) s, respectively. In stage 2, after induction with a fixed dose of 0.82 mg kg-1 as a bolus over 5 s or as an infusion at 25 mg min-1, the times for induction were 38.5 (14.0) s and 144.5 (36.6) s, respectively. In the young patients, at induction rates of 33.3, 50, 100 or 200 mg min-1, the doses administered were propofol 1.36 (0.28) mg kg-1, 1.46 (0.12) mg kg-1, 1.85 (0.43) mg kg-1 and 2.39 (0.50) mg kg-1 and the induction times 145.0 (25.4) s, 120.0 (18.4) s, 80.2 (19.2) s and 54.5 (10.4) s, respectively. In stage 2, a fixed induction dose of 1.46 mg kg-1 resulted in induction times of 35.0 (8.5) s and 134.0 (26.8) s, respectively. In stage 2 of each age group, induction was achieved with smaller doses than those recommended previously and there was no difference in the number of patients in whom induction of anaesthesia was successful or in the measured cardiorespiratory variables between the two induction regimens. This suggests the latter effects are caused by the dose administered and not the rate of administration.

16204528|t|A Lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human gastrointestinal microbiota origin elicits killing of enterovirulent Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium by triggering lethal bacterial membrane damage.
16204528|a|The human gastrointestinal microbiota produces antagonistic activities against gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens. We undertook a study to investigate the mechanism(s) by which a Lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human microbiota origin antagonizes the gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We showed that the cell-free culture supernatant of L. acidophilus strain LB (LB-CFCS) induced the following effects in S. enterica SL1344: (i) a decrease in intracellular ATP that paralleled bacterial death, (ii) the release of lipopolysaccharide, (iii) permeabilization of the bacterial membrane, and (iv) an increase in the sensitivity of Salmonella to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Finally, we showed using two mutant strains of Salmonella, PhoP MS7953s and PmrA JKS1170, that the two-component regulatory systems PhoP-PhoQ and PmrA-PmrB that regulate the mechanisms of resistance to antibacterial agents in Salmonella did not influence the anti-Salmonella effect of LB-CFCS.

21825289|t|Once-daily amikacin dosing in burn patients treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
21825289|a|Amikacin clearance can be increased in burn injury, which is often complicated by renal insufficiency. Little is known about the impact of renal replacement therapies, such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), on amikacin pharmacokinetics. We retrospectively examined the clinical pharmacokinetics, bacteriology, and clinical outcomes of 60 burn patients given 15 mg/kg of body weight of amikacin in single daily doses. Twelve were treated with concurrent CVVH therapy, and 48 were not. The pharmacodynamic target of >= 10 for the maximum concentration of drug in serum divided by the MIC (C(max)/MIC) was achieved in only 8.5% of patients, with a small reduction of C(max) in patients receiving CVVH and no difference in amikacin clearance. Mortality and burn size were greater in patients who received CVVH. Overall, 172 Gram-negative isolates were recovered from the blood cultures of 39 patients, with amikacin MIC data available for 82 isolates from 24 patients. A 10,000-patient Monte Carlo simulation was conducted incorporating pharmacokinetic and MIC data from these patients. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was similar in CVVH and non-CVVH patients. The CFR rates were not significantly improved by a theoretical 20 mg/kg amikacin dose. Overall, CVVH did not appear to have a major impact on amikacin serum concentrations. The low pharmacodynamic target attainment appears to be primarily due to higher amikacin MICs rather than more rapid clearance of amikacin related to CVVH therapy.

1565345|t|The maternal hemodynamic effect of indomethacin in normal pregnancy.
1565345|a|The vasodilation of pregnancy is thought by many to be due to increased endothelial production of prostacyclin, a vasodilatory prostanoid. Indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, is known to increase the maternal blood pressure response to angiotensin II infusion. We sought to measure directly the hemodynamic effects of a short course of indomethacin. Twenty-three healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies between 26-32 weeks' gestation completed the study. Using Doppler technology, we determined cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance before and after three 25-mg doses of indomethacin. Although blood pressure did not change, peripheral resistance rose and stroke volume fell following indomethacin administration. Our findings support the hypothesis that indomethacin interferes with tonic prostaglandin-induced vasodilation in pregnancy. However, the increase in vascular resistance was very slight, suggesting that other vasodilators are also at work in pregnancy. We recommend that indomethacin be used judiciously in hypertensive pregnant patients until more information concerning possible adverse hemodynamic effects becomes available.

17336534|a|The chemical investigation of the Mediterranean ascidian Clavelina phlegraea has led to the isolation of six new 2-amino-3-alkanol derivatives, clavaminols A-F (1-6). Their stereostructures were established by analysis of spectroscopic data and chemical conversion. Clavaminols A, B, C, and F were tested for their cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic properties and clavaminol A was shown to be the more potent cytotoxic compound of this series inducing cell death through activation of the apoptotic machinery.

14585916|t|Measuring dyspepsia-related health in randomized trials: the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) and its use in treatment with NSAIDs and COX-2-specific inhibitors.
14585916|a|Dyspepsia is a common problem that is important from the perspectives of both patient health and economics. While there has been variability in the definitions used to describe dyspepsia, there have also been few standardized outcomes tools designed to measure dyspepsia-related health, especially in relation to changes in dyspepsia over time. An evaluative tool was developed, the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA), which takes into account the multidimensional nature of dyspepsia using three scales (Pain, Non-pain Symptoms, and Satisfaction with Dyspepsia-related Health) and demonstrates good psychometric properties with respect to validity, reliability and sensitivity to change in the measurement of dyspepsia-related health. Although originally developed for the assessment of uninvestigated dyspepsia, the validation of SODA for use in clinical trials suggested its ability to compare treatment effects of non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors. In comparative trials of celecoxib or valdecoxib with non-specific NSAIDs, COX-2-specific inhibitors were demonstrated to have superior dyspepsia tolerability than non-specific NSAIDs. These data demonstrate that SODA is an effective instrument for measuring dyspepsia-related health with a broad range of applications.

15163121|t|Drug-induced severe hypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetic patients aged 80 years or older.
15163121|a|Our knowledge about the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with diabetes treatment is derived from studies that often exclude elderly people. Aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for developing severe hypoglycaemia among persons aged 80 yr or older, with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). During a 2-yr period, all episodes of severe hypoglycaemia occurred in T2DM patients aged 80 yr or older were identified. Hypoglycaemia was defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with i.v. glucose and confirmed by a blood glucose determination of less than 50 mg/dl. A detailed history and blood laboratory profile were obtained for each patient. During the period of the survey a total of 124 diabetic subjects aged 80 yr or older were hospitalised and severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 31 patients (25%). This group of patients had a marked comorbidity and was found to have HbA1c values of 5.1% indicating that their diabetes was well controlled. Of these hypoglycaemic episodes, 23 (74%) occurred in patients taking glibenclamide. Diabetes therapy was prescribed by general practitioners in 24 of these patients. Seventeen subjects concomitantly received drugs that potentiated hypoglycaemia. Only 10 patients performed regular blood glucose self-monitoring. In conclusion, severe hypoglycaemia is a serious and not uncommon problem among elderly patients with T2DM; it is more frequent in patients undergoing aggressive diabetes management and in users of a long-acting sulphonylurea (eg, glibenclamide). A normal HbA1c level in this age group appears to be a powerful indicator of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia and should alert clinicians to change therapy. Finally, each patient's risk for hypoglycaemia should be considered and therapy should be individualised accordingly; in our opinion, a great number of episodes of serious hypoglycaemia may be prevented by teaching the principles of blood glucose monitoring and involving general practitioners in outpatient management of diabetes mellitus in the elderly.

23291665|t|Protein profiling of paraquat-exposed rat lungs following treatment with Acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) berry extract.
23291665|a|Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium chloride, PQ) is a non-selective herbicide, and PQ poisoning by accidental or intentional ingestion is a cause of numerous fatalities around the world every year. Although a great deal of research has been conducted into the development of an acceptable treatment for PQ poisoning, no effective guidelines for patients have been developed thus far. Acai berry extract and juice have been highlighted in this regard, due to their observed antioxidant effects in various diseases. Furthermore, the acai berry has been used in dietary supplements, as it contains a variety of nutrients, including proteins, lipids, vitamins A, C and E and polyphenols. In this study, we conducted proteomic analysis of PQ-poisoned rat lungs to evaluate the changes in protein expression induced by PQ and to identify any protective effects of acai berry on the PQ poisoning. Our data revealed that the expression of the calcium signaling-related proteins calcium binding protein 1 (CaBP1), FK506 binding protein 4 (FKBP4), S100A6 and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc, also known as osteonectin) were induced by PQ treatment and downregulated by acai berry treatment. However, the levels of protein kinase C substrate 80K-H were shown to be downregulated as the result of PQ treatment. Our results indicated that these proteins may function as biomarkers for acute poisoning by PQ exposure. Further studies may be necessary to understand their clinical relevance with regard to PQ poisoning.

16801404|t|Absence of cochleotoxicity measured by standard and high-frequency pure tone audiometry in a trial of once- versus three-times-daily tobramycin in cystic fibrosis patients.
16801404|a|We undertook assessment of hearing in patients with cystic fibrosis who were taking part in a large randomized controlled trial of once- versus three-times-daily tobramycin for pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (the TOPIC study). All patients were eligible to have standard pure tone audiometry performed across the frequency range of 0.25 to 8 kHz. High-frequency pure tone audiometry over 10 to 16 kHz was also performed with a subset of patients. Audiometry was undertaken at the start of tobramycin treatment, at the end of a 14-day course of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later. We enrolled 244 patients, of whom 219 (125 children and 94 adults) completed treatment. Nineteen patients were excluded from analysis due to abnormal baseline audiometry. Complete pre- and posttreatment standard audiological data were obtained for 168/219 patients. We found no significant differences in hearing thresholds when they were assessed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, and at follow-up 6 to 8 weeks later were compared. In addition, no significant differences in hearing thresholds were detected between treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained for the subset of 63/168 patients who underwent high-frequency audiometry. We conclude that for a single 14-day course of tobramycin treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis with no preexisiting auditory deficit, no measurable effect on hearing was apparent with either once- or three-times-daily treatment. Estimation of the cumulative cochleotoxic risk in cystic fibrosis patients due to repeated aminoglycoside therapy, as evidenced by the patients excluded from this study due to hearing loss, also requires further characterization.

16856046|t|Endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
16856046|a|BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease, which leads to right heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be classified into five categories according to Venice classification: (1) Idiopathic PAH; (2) Familial PAH; (3) PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, HIV infection, drugs and toxins or other (thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy); (4) PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement, which includes pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH); (5) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. PAH can also be secondary to chronic hypoxic lung disease as part of the "cor-pulmonale" syndrome, and also secondary to left sided heart disease, but these conditions are usually distinguished from those listed here. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists in pulmonary arterial hypertension. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was carried out using the CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the reference section of retrieved articles. Searches are current as of August 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were selected by two reviewers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected studies; assessed study quality; and extracted data. We analysed outcomes as continuous and dichotomous data. MAIN RESULTS: In this updated version of the review, we added two RCTs. Altogether, five RCTs met the entry criteria of the review (reporting eight group comparisons). The studies were of short duration (12-16 weeks), recruiting a total of 482 participants. Three studies compared a non-selective ERA (bosentan) with placebo, one compared bosentan with sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) , and one compared a selective ERA (sitaxsentan) with placebo. Over a 12-16 week period ERAs improved exercise capacity, improve Borg dyspnoea score, some measures of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics (pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac index) in symptomatic patients with mainly idiopathic PAH. The effect of ERAs on mortality was not significant. The most severe side effect, hepatic toxicity, was not common. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ERAs in conjunction with conventional therapy over 12 to 16 weeks can improve exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea scores and several cardiopulmonary haemodynamics variables in patients mainly with idiopathic PAH. The data on mortality do not currently show a benefit of this class of drugs on this endpoint. Additional assessment of this outcome is important in order to establish whether there is evidence that ERAs have an impact on the risk of death. Longer studies are required.

9477050|t|Effects of intravenous anesthetics on normal and passively sensitized human isolated airway smooth muscle.
9477050|a|BACKGROUND: General anesthetics may modify airway responsiveness. The authors investigated the effect of thiopental, propofol, and etomidate on airway smooth muscle. METHODS: Contraction experiments were done in human airway rings that were either normal or passively sensitized with asthmatic serum. The effect of propofol and etomidate was also studied on both [Ca2+]i increase measured by microspectrofluorimetry in isolated myocytes and isometric contraction in the rat trachea. RESULTS: In human bronchi, thiopental (10[-7] to 10[-4] M) induced a concentration-dependent contraction. Neither propofol nor etomidate altered baseline tone, but both anesthetics reduced histamine-induced contraction. In human immunologically sensitized isolated bronchi, propofol (3 x 10[-4] M) reduced histamine reactivity (deltaFmax in %) to a greater degree than in nonsensitized tissues (64.4 +/- 15.7% and 16.4 +/- 8.5%, respectively; n = 6, P < 0.05), whereas the effect of etomidate (10[-4] M) was similar in both types of tissue (24.1 +/- 6% and 22.3 +/- 15%, respectively, n = 6). In rat isolated tracheal myocytes, propofol (3 x 10[-4] M) and etomidate (10[-4] M) altered the [Ca2+]i signal in response to the depolarizing agent potassium chloride and the muscarinic agonist acetylcholine. Accordingly, the two anesthetics also reduced the mechanical response of rat tracheal rings to these agonists. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas thiopental contracts human isolated bronchi, propofol and etomidate reduce histamine-induced contraction in human isolated airway smooth muscle that were either not sensitized or passively sensitized with asthmatic serum. This effect involves inhibition of both electro- and pharmacomechanical coupling.

19351236|t|Efficacy and safety of intranasal xylometazoline and ipratropium in patients with common cold.
19351236|a|BACKGROUND: Many over-the-counter medications are available to treat common cold nasal symptoms, but patients may be unsure which one to use. METHODS: This review assesses two widely used intranasal treatments for nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in the common cold: xylometazoline hydrochloride and ipratropium bromide. RESULTS: Xylometazoline quickly and effectively relieves nasal congestion, while ipratropium is effective at reducing rhinorrhea. When used in combination, a novel approach to treatment, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are treated simultaneously, providing effective relief from two of the most troublesome symptoms of the common cold Both drugs are well tolerated, with only mild to moderate, nasal-related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of the combination product suggest that it should be used first-line in the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, before the use of oral treatments.

10400420|t|Induction of apoptosis and differentiation by fludarabine in human leukemia cells (U937): interactions with the macrocyclic lactone bryostatin 1.
10400420|a|We have examined interactions between the purine nucleoside analog fludarabine (9-beta-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine) and the macrocyclic lactone bryostatin 1 in the human monocytic leukemic cell line U937. Fludarabine exerted dose-dependent effects on U937 cell viability and growth which were associated with both induction of apoptosis, as well as cellular maturation. Incubation of cells with bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 24 h) after, but not before a 6-h exposure to 10 microM fludarabine resulted in a modest but significant increase in apoptosis, and was associated with greater than a 1 log reduction in clonogenicity. Subsequent exposure to bryostatin 1 also increased the percentage of fludarabine-treated cells displaying differentiation-related features (eg plastic adherence, CD11b positivity) compared to cells exposed to fludarabine alone. Bryostatin 1 did not increase the retention of the active fludarabine metabolite, F-ara-ATP, nor did it increase 3H-F-ara-A incorporation into DNA. Despite its capacity to trigger cellular maturation, fludarabine exposure (either with or without bryostatin 1) failed to induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKls) p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. Nevertheless, dysregulation of p21 (resulting from stable transfection of cells with a p2lWAF1/CIP1 antisense construct) reduced fludarabine-mediated differentiation, while inducing a corresponding increase in apoptosis. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 partially protected cells from fludarabine-related apoptosis, an effect that was overcome, in part, by subsequent exposure of cells to bryostatin 1. Interestingly, Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were as or in some cases, more susceptible to differentiation induction by fludarabine (+/- bryostatin 1) than their empty vector-containing counterparts. Collectively, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effects of fludarabine toward U937 leukemic cells involve both induction of apoptosis and cellular maturation, and that each of these processes may be enhanced by bryostatin 1.

1739240|t|Wegener granulomatosis: an analysis of 158 patients.
1739240|a|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively study the clinical features, pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis of Wegener granulomatosis. DESIGN: Of the 180 patients with Wegener granulomatosis referred to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the past 24 years, 158 have been followed for 6 months to 24 years (a total of 1229 patient-years). MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of clinical presentation, surgical pathology, course of illness, laboratory and radiographic findings, and the results of medical and surgical treatment have been recorded in a computer-based information retrieval system. SETTING: The Warren Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. MAIN RESULTS: Men and women were equally represented; 97% of patients were white, and 85% were more than 19 years of age. The mean period of follow-up was 8 years. One hundred and thirty-three patients (84%) received "standard" therapy with daily low-dose cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids. Eight (5.0%) received only low-dose cyclophosphamide. Six (4.0%) never received cyclophosphamide and were treated with other cytotoxic agents and glucocorticoids. Ten patients (6.0%) were treated with only glucocorticoids. Ninety-one percent of patients experienced marked improvement, and 75% achieved complete remission. Fifty percent of remissions were associated with one or more relapses. Of 99 patients followed for greater than 5 years, 44% had remissions of greater than 5 years duration. Thirteen percent of patients died of Wegener granulomatosis, treatment-related causes, or both. Almost all patients had serious morbidity from irreversible features of their disease (86%) or side effects of treatment (42%). CONCLUSIONS: The course of Wegener granulomatosis has been dramatically improved by daily treatment with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids. Nonetheless, disease- and treatment-related morbidity is often profound. Alternative forms of therapy have not yet achieved the high rates of remission induction and successful maintenance that have been reported with daily cyclophosphamide treatment. Despite continued therapeutic success with cyclophosphamide, our long-term follow-up of patients with Wegener granulomatosis has led to increasing concerns about toxicity resulting from prolonged cyclophosphamide therapy and has encouraged investigation of other therapeutic regimens.

22181812|t|Iron facilitator LS081 reduces hypoxia-inducible factor-1a protein and functions as anticancer agent in hepatocellular carcinoma.
22181812|a|Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) has a central role in cellular oxygen-sensing, and its overexpression in many types of cancer is considered important in tumor progression. Thus, targeting HIF-1a production and activity has been of great therapeutic interest. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1a is hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases, which require ferrous iron for its activity. The tumor suppressor protein von Hippel Lindau binds to the hydroxylated HIF-1a, which is then ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. We focused on the physiological degradation machinery of HIF-1a mediated by prolyl hydroxylases. Previously, we identified a small molecule, LS081, that is capable of stimulating iron uptake into cells. In the present study, we aimed to inhibit the expression of HIF-1a protein and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by using the iron-facilitating activity of LS081. In the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep3B and HepG2, a combination of LS081 and ferric ammonium citrate (LS081/FeAC) inhibited HIF-1a protein expression but did not inhibit HIF-1a mRNA expression. A mutated HIF-1a protein, which has proline residues that were replaced with alanine and transfected into HEK293 cells, was not affected by the combination of LS081 and FeAC. Furthermore, the iron-facilitating activity of LS081 resulted in Hep3B and HepG2 growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that the iron-facilitating activity of LS081 inhibits HIF-1a expression through prolyl-hydroxylation of HIF-1a and might have a therapeutic effect in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

22268775|t|Opioid use and dependence among persons with migraine: results of the AMPP study.
22268775|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of opioid use for acute migraine treatment and characterize use groups by sociodemographics, health-care resource utilization (HRU), comorbidities and probable dependence within a large, US population-based sample of persons with migraine. BACKGROUND: Opioids are used in the acute treatment of migraine. However, their use is controversial. METHODS: Data from the 2009 American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) study were used to categorize persons with migraine into 4 groups based on reported opioid use: nonusers (between 2005 and 2009), previous users (history of use between 2005 and 2008 but no-use in 2009), and current opioid users (those reporting use of opioids in the 3 months preceding the 2009 American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention survey). Current opioid users were divided into nondependent and probable dependence users according to criteria for dependence adapted for inclusion in the survey from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th edition. All opioid-use groups were contrasted by sociodemographics, headache characteristics, medical and psychiatric comorbidities (depression [measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9], anxiety [measured by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Health Disorders, PRIME-MD], and cardiovascular events and risk factors), and headache-related HRU. RESULTS: In a sample of 5796 migraineurs, 4076 (70.3%) were opioid nonusers, 798 (13.8%) were previous users, and 922 (15.9%) were current opioid users. Among current opioid users, 153 (16.6%) met criteria for probable dependence and 769 (83.4%) did not. Headache-related disability (Migraine Disability Assessment sum scores) increased across groups as follows: nonusers: 7.8, previous users: 13.3, current nondependent users: 19.1, and current probable dependence users: 44.4, as did monthly headache frequency: nonusers: 3.2 days/month, previous users: 4.3 days/month, current nondependent users: 5.6 days/month, and current probable dependence users: 8.6 days/month. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was highest among current users with probable dependence. Rates of headache-related HRU were higher for all opioid-use groups for emergency department/urgent care, primary care, and specialty care visits compared to nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid use for migraine is associated with more severe headache-related disability, symptomology, comorbidities (depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease and events), and greater HRU for headache. Longitudinal studies are needed to further assess the directionality and causality between opioid use and the outcomes we examined.

23664097|t|Enhancement role of host 12/15-lipoxygenase in melanoma progression.
23664097|a|12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) is a non-haeme iron-containing dioxygenase that forms 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or 15(S)-HETE. Several biological mediators including cytokines, growth factors and lipid metabolites released during tumour cell-endothelial cell adhesion are associated with malignant tumour progression. Here we found that HETEs released from the host organ played a critical role in tumour metastasis. Intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells caused lung nodule formation, which was markedly attenuated in 12/15-LOX null mice. Co-injection of melanoma cells with 12(S)-HETE increased the lung homing activity of B16F10 melanoma cells. In vitro studies showed that 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of adhesion of B16F10 cells on collagen or fibronectin. The melanoma cell adhesion was then evaluated in pulmonary primary cell culture isolated from wild-type (WT) and 12/15-LOX knockout (KO) mice. It was found that the adhesion of melanoma cells on the epithelial cells isolated from 12/15-LOX null mice was reduced in comparison with those isolated from WT mice. Treatment of 12(S)-HETE increased the pFAK in melanoma cells adhering on collagen-coated slide. The enhancement of adherence elicited by 12(S)-HETE in B16F10 cells could be antagonised by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor 14 (FAK inhibitor) or PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor). 12(S)-HETE increased the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK in adhering melanoma cells. The FAK phosphorylation induced by 12(S)-HETE was further inhibited by PD98059, indicating that FAK is the downstream target of ERK. The adhesion and lung metastasis of human melanoma cells of C32 in NOD/SCID mice were also potentiated by co-treatment with 12(S)-HETE. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE activates ERK and FAK signalling pathways, thereby upregulates the adhesion and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. The endogenous release of 12(S)-HETE/15(S)-HETE in the host organ may affect the metastatic potential of melanoma.

8893126|t|Interferon alfa therapy in adults with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
8893126|a|The role of interferon alfa-2b in the treatment of chronic ITP has not been well documented. One small clinical trial indicated that 84.6% of patients failing to respond to corticosteroid therapy and splenectomy might respond to interferon alfa-2b. These results cannot be extrapolated to all patients refractory to steroids. Subsequent anecdotal reports have not demonstrated a similar response, possibly because the reports included patients who were no longer responsive to corticosteroids, splenectomy, and other agents (i.e., vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, danazol, azathioprine, immunoglobulin). This latter group of patients may have a poor prognosis and less chance of responding to interferon alfa-2b therapy. Therefore, the role of interferon alfa-2b in the treatment of patients with chronic ITP unresponsive to other forms of therapy remains to be established, but it may prove beneficial in some patients. Uncertainty remains as to the reason for lack of interferon alfa-2b efficacy. There is question of a presence of rapid development of antibodies against interferon alfa-2b. In addition, it is unknown whether interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b are capable of producing similar results in the treatment of chronic ITP.

8898647|t|Sodium, hydrogen antiporter activation by extracellular adenosine triphosphate in biliary epithelial cells.
8898647|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Extracellular nucleotides are secretagogues and influence ion permeability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether secretagogues activate transmembrane acid-base carriers, e.g., sodium, hydrogen antiporter in cholangiocytes. METHODS: Cells were loaded with pH and Ca(2+)-sensitive dyes. Intracellular changes in ion concentrations were monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate was determined by standard methods. RESULTS: Baseline intracellular pH (pH1) averaged 7.28 +/- 0.17 pH units. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP; 10 mumol/L) increased baseline pH1 by 0.28 +/- 0.06 pH units/10 min (P < 0.01). Ten and 100 mumol/L ATP increased Na+, H+ antiporter-mediated proton flux from 9.4 +/- 4.9 mmol. L-1 min-1 to 17.2 +/- 11.8 and 16.7 +/- 10.3 mmol. L(-1)-min(-1) (P < 0.001), respectively. Under control and ATP-stimulated conditions, 1 mmol/L amiloride blocked pH1 recovery, indicating true activation of Na+, H+ antiporter by extracellular ATP. Inhibition of basolateral Na+, H+ antiporter isoform inhibited stimulation by ATP. Na+, H+ antiporter-mediated proton flux was stimulated by adenosine, uridine triphosphate, adenosine-5'-0-(3-thiotriphosphate), alpha, beta-methylene-ATP, and 2-methylthio-ATP but not prevented by adenosine receptor blocking. Activation by ATP was not influenced by the Ca2+/protein kinase C/calmodulin system but could be mimicked by addition of N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and was inhibited by pertussis toxin. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular nucleotides may modulate secretory and absorptive function of cholangiocytes by activating Na+/H+ exchange mechanisms.

20540689|t|Specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen induced by a low dose of cisplatin: altered iron metabolism and its implication as an acute hemosiderin formation model.
20540689|a|Cisplatin is one of the commonly-used chemotherapeutic drugs to efficiently treat malignant tumors in clinic, however, the adverse effects of cisplatin such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are often observed at its clinical doses (approximately 60 mg/m(2)), which limit its broader application. In earlier studies, little attention was paid to the subtle changes in the architecture of lymphatic organs after low doses of cisplatin treatment. This paper reviews current understanding of cisplatin-induced erythrocyte injury, and presents our latest finding that a low dose of cisplatin (3.6 mg/m(2)/day, 14 days) could induce specific hemosiderin deposition in spleen of both normal and hepatoma-22 (H22) inoculated Balb/C mice. This dose of cisplatin significantly inhibited H22-induced acute ascites development. No significant toxicity was induced by this dose of cisplatin to tissues except for hemosiderin accumulation in the spleen of both normal and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Increased splenic iron content and erythrocyte injury were observed after treatment with the low dose of cisplatin. The mRNA levels of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin were upregulated by 25 and 5-fold in spleen, respectively. Overexpression of FPN1 and ferritin protein were also been observed at protein levels by Western blotting analysis. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepcidin was also increased, suggesting blockage of iron recycling through FPN1 in spleen with cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, cisplatin treatment damages the erythrocytes which accumulate in the red pulp of spleen with defective recycling of FPN1 and ferritin protein. Hepcidin inhibits the function of FPN1 as iron-exporter leading to iron overloaded inside ferritins of splenic cells, which are stained with abnormal hemosiderin accumulation. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-caused hemosiderin deposition in spleen provides a valuable clue for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of cisplatin and hemosiderin accumulation and iron metabolism in vivo.

10383804|t|Influence of etoposide on the retention of radiolabeled low-density lipoprotein in the arterial wall.
10383804|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular toxicity of chemotherapy for testicular cancer is a matter of discussion, since highly efficient agents can achieve cure of the disease, even in the metastasized setting. Acute ischemic events during the treatment period and a persistently elevated serum cholesterol thereafter are observations of particular concern in these patients, and the underlying basic mechanisms are unknown to date. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate etoposide, which is part of the standard treatment for testicular cancer, as a potential cause of atherogenesis in an experimental model. SETTING: Aortic 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein retention was studied in 72 cholesterol-fed rabbits under etoposide treatment and was quantified according to the morphologically assessed type of surface lining. Aortic cholesterol content was determined both by Sudan III staining and quantitatively by a biochemical assay. RESULTS: A reduced uptake of 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein in the arterial wall was observed in the etoposide-treated animals, which resulted in a size reduction of sudanophilic areas and cholesterol content. Whereas the breakdown of 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein in the liver was not significantly enhanced, the plasma decay of 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein was faster and serum cholesterol was lower in the etoposide group than in controls. CONCLUSION: Unexpectedly, we found an improvement of arterial wall lipid metabolism under etoposide treatment and can thus exclude this substance as a promoter of atherogenesis in this model.

10382555|t|Therapeutic review: is ascorbic acid of value in chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis?
10382555|a|INTRODUCTION: Repeated topical exposure to chromium(VI) may cause an allergic contact dermatitis or the formation of chrome ulcers. Systemic toxicity may occur following the ingestion of a chromium(VI) salt, from chromium(VI)-induced skin burns, or from inhalation of chromium(VI) occurring occupationally. Soluble chromium(VI) salts are usually absorbed more easily and cross cell membranes more readily than trivalent chromium salts, and, therefore chromium(VI) is more toxic than chromium(III). In experimental studies, endogenous ascorbic acid in rat lung, liver, and kidney and human plasma, effectively reduces chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The administration of exogenous ascorbic acid has been advocated therefore in the treatment of systemic chromium poisoning and chromium dermatitis to enhance the extracellular reduction of chromium(VI) to the less bioavailable chromium(III). REVIEW: In vitro experiments confirm that the addition of ascorbic acid to plasma containing chromium(VI) leads to a dose-dependent reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). In animal studies, parenteral ascorbic acid 0.5-5 g/kg significantly reduced chromium-induced nephrotoxicity when administered 30 minutes before parenteral sodium dichromate and up to 1 hour after parenteral sodium chromate dosing. Parenteral ascorbic acid 0.5-5 g/kg also reduced mortality when given orally up to 2 hours after oral potassium dichromate dosing. However, the administration of parenteral ascorbic acid more than 2 hours after parenteral chromate in these experimental studies did not protect against renal damage, and parenteral ascorbic acid given 3 hours postparenteral chromate increased toxicity. In addition, there is no confirmed clinical evidence that the administration of ascorbic acid lessens morbidity or mortality in systemic chromium poisoning. A possible reason for the lack of benefit of ascorbic acid when administration is delayed, is that chromium(VI) cellular uptake has occurred prior to ascorbic acid administration. Topical 10% ascorbic acid has been claimed to reduce significantly the healing time of experimentally induced chrome ulcers in guinea pigs. The proposed mechanism is reduction on the skin surface of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). Several case reports suggest that topical ascorbic acid is effective in the management of chromium dermatitis but this has not been confirmed in controlled clinical trials and, moreover, the practical difficulties of frequent application are likely to limit its usefulness. DISCUSSION: Based on experimental studies, substantial amounts of ascorbic acid would need to be administered, preferably parenterally, soon after exposure to prevent systemic toxicity from chromium(VI) in humans. However, as ascorbic acid is a metabolic precursor of oxalate, the administration of ascorbic acid in high dose could lead to acute oxalate nephropathy, particularly in the presence of renal failure. While smaller doses of ascorbic acid (e.g., 10 g intravenously) are not toxic, such doses probably will not reduce the mortality from systemic chromium poisoning. CONCLUSION: There is currently insufficient evidence to advocate the use of ascorbic acid in the management of systemic chromium toxicity. Topical ascorbic acid may reduce dermal hexavalent chromium exposure, but this observation must be confirmed in controlled studies.

11358732|t|Occupational allergic contact dermatitis from alkylammonium amidobenzoate.
11358732|a|Quaternary ammonium compounds are water-soluble antimicrobials which are widely used in disinfectants, sterilizers, skin cleansers and antiseptic creams. One quaternary ammonium compound, alkylammonium amidobenzoate (Osmaron B) has for decades been used in udder ointments. Here we present a ship technician with occupationally induced sensitization to alkylammonium amidobenzoate. The diagnosis was reached only when it emerged, after careful questioning, that the patient was exposed to a substance peculiar to his workplace but not to his occupation and was then patch tested for it. It turned out that an udder ointment had been used at the patient's workplace as a hand ointment. Patch testing was positive to the patient's hand ointment, and Osmaron B at 0.1-0.01% in petrolatum. Other sensitizing quaternary ammonium compounds, namely benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzoxonium chloride, N-benzyl-N,N-dihydroxyethyl-N-cocosalkyl-ammonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium bromide, chloroallylhexaminium chloride, dequalinium chloride, domiphen bromide, methylbenzethonium chloride and 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride are reviewed briefly. The importance of patch testing to all materials in use by the patient is emphasized. It is also important to select non-allergenic hand creams for use at work places.

20427683|t|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy facilitates healing of chronic foot ulcers in patients with diabetes.
20427683|a|OBJECTIVE: Chronic diabetic foot ulcers are a source of major concern for both patients and health care systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Diabetics with Chronic Foot Ulcers (HODFU) study was a randomized, single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The outcomes for the group receiving HBOT were compared with those of the group receiving treatment with hyperbaric air. Treatments were given in a multi-place hyperbaric chamber for 85-min daily (session duration 95 min), five days a week for eight weeks (40 treatment sessions). The study was performed in an ambulatory setting. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients with Wagner grade 2, 3, or 4 ulcers, which had been present for >3 months, were studied. In the intention-to-treat analysis, complete healing of the index ulcer was achieved in 37 patients at 1-year of follow-up: 25/48 (52%) in the HBOT group and 12/42 (29%) in the placebo group (P = 0.03). In a sub-analysis of those patients completing >35 HBOT sessions, healing of the index ulcer occurred in 23/38 (61%) in the HBOT group and 10/37 (27%) in the placebo group (P = 0.009). The frequency of adverse events was low. CONCLUSIONS: The HODFU study showed that adjunctive treatment with HBOT facilitates healing of chronic foot ulcers in selected patients with diabetes.

7726527|t|Polymyxin B stimulates production of complement components and cytokines in human monocytes.
7726527|a|Polymyxin B (PmB), an agent often used to neutralize the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was shown to exert a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on the biosynthesis of C3, factor B, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in human monocytes. A low dose of PmB (1 to 5 micrograms/ml) efficiently suppressed the LPS-induced (1 or 100 ng/ml) production of IL-6, GM-CSF, and factor B, but not the C3 production induced by 100 ng of LPS per ml. A reduced level of GM-CSF may have contributed to the persisting high C3 concentrations and the apparent lack of LPS inhibition in the latter situation, since GM-CSF is an inhibitor of monocyte C3 biosynthesis.

10837297|t|Variability of the conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A in women measured by using a double-tracer study design.
10837297|a|BACKGROUND: Blood beta-carotene and vitamin A responses to oral beta-carotene are variable in humans. Some individuals are characterized as responders and others as low- or nonresponders. A better understanding of the conditions that produce the variability is important to help design public health programs that ensure vitamin A sufficiency. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess variability in absorption and conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A in vivo in humans by using a novel double-tracer  ¿hexadeuterated (D(6)) beta-carotene and D(6) retinyl acetate approach. DESIGN: Eleven healthy women were housed at the US Department of Agriculture Western Human Nutrition Research Center metabolic unit for 44 d, where they consumed diets adequate in vitamins and minerals except for carotenoids. After an adaptation period, the women were given 30 micromol D(6) retinyl acetate orally, followed 1 wk later with 37 micromol D(6) beta-carotene (approximately equimolar doses). Time-dependent plasma concentration curves were determined for D(6) retinol, D(6) beta-carotene, and trideuterated (D(3)) retinol (derived from D(6) beta-carotene). RESULTS: Mean (+/-SE) absorption of D(6) beta-carotene was 3.3 +/- 1.3% for all subjects. The mean conversion ratio was 0.81 +/- 0.34 mol D(3) retinol to 1 mol D(6) beta-carotene for all subjects. However, only 6 of the 11 subjects had plasma D(6) beta-carotene and D(3) retinol concentrations that we could measure. The mean absorption of D(6) beta-carotene in these 6 subjects was 6.1 +/- 0.02% and their conversion ratio was 1.47 +/- 0.49 mol D(3) retinol to 1 mol D(6) beta-carotene. The remaining 5 subjects were low responders with </=0.01% absorption and a mean conversion ratio of 0.014 +/- 0.004 mol D(3) retinol to 1 mol D(6) beta-carotene. CONCLUSION: Variable absorption and conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A both contribute to the variable response to consumption of beta-carotene. Our double-tracer approach is adaptable for identifying efficient converters of carotenoid to retinoid.

20687864|t|Dermanyssus gallinae infestation: an unusual cause of scalp pruritus treated with permethrin shampoo.
20687864|a|Dermanyssus gallinae is a blood parasite of wild birds, but it is also a pest in the poultry industry. It occasionally bites mammals and thus rarely creates skin problems such as itching, papules, vesicles, and dermatitis. A 92-year-old man presented with severe itch on his head, particularly at night. He had been misdiagnosed with senile pruritus and treated with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids with temporary relief of the symptoms. On the basis of clinical and parasitological findings, D. gallinae dermatitis was diagnosed. Decontamination of the patient's immediate environment was not helpful. The patient was successfully treated using a 1% permethrin shampoo once a week for 2 weeks. During 3 months of follow-up he was free of symptoms. The case is of significance because most dermatologists have difficulty identifying ectoparasitoses, such as those that arise within new or atypical conditions.

18483104|t|Radioiodine therapy and Graves' ophthalmopathy.
18483104|a|Appearances of and increases in Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) have been reported after treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism with radioiodine. We sought to determine the rates of appearance or increase in manifestations of GO in American patients treated with radioiodine for hyperthyroidism. METHODS: The study population, which consisted of 76 patients (range, 10.6-72 y), included 61 women and individuals of diverse ethnicity. The patients were followed for 1 y after radioiodine treatment. The clinical activity score (CAS) included 10 items of ophthalmic change that were evaluated at 2 and 6 mo and at 1 y; appearance of a new item scored 1 point. We evaluated interactions of 6 covariates-prolonged hyperthyroidism, prolonged hypothyroidism, smoking, treatment with an antithyroid drug (ATD), and serum levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and of high free T3 (FT3)--with the numbers of patients with 2 or more CAS points and with exophthalmometer readings increased by at least 2 mm. In addition, patients completed a scored quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire at baseline and at 1 y to assess eye symptoms. RESULTS: The mean CAS points for all patients at 2 mo was 0.63 and was not significantly different at 1 y. In 9 of 10 CAS items, there were few patients affected at 1 y and for the most part there were fewer patients affected than at baseline. However, exophthalmometer readings increased in 39% of patients by a mean of 2.6 mm. Individual patients frequently exhibited increases and decreases in item manifestations. Exophthalmometer readings decreased by 2 mm or less in 13%. Of the covariates, only hyperthyroidism prolonged by at least 2.5 mo was significantly associated with 2 or more CAS points at 1 y; no covariate was significantly associated with the development of increased exophthalmometer readings. Eye symptoms recorded in the QOL were insignificantly improved over the year; symptoms did not correlate with CAS points or with exophthalmometer readings. CONCLUSION: After radioiodine treatment, no substantial change was seen in manifestations of CAS items except for a modest increase in exophthalmometer readings in 39% of patients. Manifestations of CAS items frequently appeared and disappeared. Prolonged hyperthyroidism is best avoided. Ocular symptoms were insignificantly fewer at 1 y after radioiodine therapy. The observed changes do not warrant prophylactic treatment of patients with steroids.

9601902|t|Chloroxylenol causing hand dermatitis in a plumber.
9601902|a|Chloroxylenol use has increased and is found in many over-the-counter preparations. Although not a common sensitizer, chloroxylenol's role as a contact allergen and relevance, when positive patch tests are found, is often high. Pre-patch test assessment generally does not identify chloroxylenol as a causative agent. It is increasingly found in liquid soaps particularly in industry and specifically in the health care environment. Even as a wash-off product, this allergen can be a hidden cause of allergic contact dermatitis.

20580532|t|Emergence of clinical strains of Mycoplasma genitalium harbouring alterations in ParC associated with fluoroquinolone resistance.
20580532|a|Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium clinical strains is extremely limited as culturing of strains from clinical specimens is still difficult. We therefore conducted a non-cultural assessment of fluoroquinolone resistance of M. genitalium clinical strains by analysing the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA and parC genes. The QRDRs amplified from M. genitalium DNA taken from urine specimens of 28 men with non-gonococcal urethritis positive for M. genitalium by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced. An amino acid change (Phe-108-->Iso) in GyrA was found in one specimen, and the same change was accompanied by an amino acid change (Lys-97-->Arg) in ParC in another specimen. A single amino acid change (Ser-83-->Asn, Asp-87-->Tyr or Asp-87-->Val) in ParC was also found in three other respective specimens without alterations in GyrA. No alterations in GyrA and ParC were found in the remaining 23 specimens. The alterations of Ser-83-->Asn, Asp-87-->Tyr and Asp-87-->Val in ParC found in 3 (10.7%) of 28 specimens were analogous to those commonly observed in fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. M. genitalium harbouring mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in the parC gene may have emerged clinically and the prevalence may be ca. 10% in Japan.

20186057|t|Supportive care in head and neck oncology.
20186057|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Survival gains were achieved in head and neck cancer patients treated with a multidisciplinary approach, including platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation, with a substantial increase in toxicity. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of these toxicities - the focus of this review - are essential aspects in the daily care of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Low-level laser is a promising therapy for prevention and treatment of mucositis. Amifostine, as an acute and late xerostomia-preventive agent, may be considered in patients undergoing fractionated radiation therapy alone. The incidence of xerostomia was significantly reduced in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Severe cutaneous reactions can occur when epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting agents are administered concurrently to radiation therapy. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should not be administered to head and neck cancer patients under radiation therapy or chemotherapy outside of the context of clinical trials. SUMMARY: The best outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated in the multidisciplinary context can only be achieved with an adequate patient selection, an experienced and motivated team and if the best possible supportive care is offered. Randomized studies on promising supportive therapies must be encouraged.

9151080|t|Transformation of a human mixed GH-PRL adenoma cell population in response to long-term bromocriptine treatment.
9151080|a|A child was operated 3 times because of a recurrent growth hormone- and prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma. Between the operations she was treated for five years with bromocriptine. The characteristics of the tumour cell population collected after the last operation was now examined by electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and in tissue culture and compared to those of the primary tumour cells reported earlier. A prominent change was the reversal of the proportion of the densely and sparsely granulated cells in favour of the GH-type, densely granulated cells. These cells, some of them coexpressing PRL, did not essentially change their characteristics either in vivo or in culture. On the other hand, pleomorphous cells with smaller cytoplasmic area and prominent lysosomal structures represented the sparsely granulated population containing PRL or both PRL and GH. The morphological alteration of the PRL-type cells was also reflected in vitro. Hence, while GH-type cells prevail, at least a sub-population of PRL-type cells survives long-term bromocriptine administration. A shift in the incidence of the two cell types in favour of the GH-type cells explains the change in the endocrine status of the patient.

1780961|t|Interactions between hydralazine and oral nutrients in humans.
1780961|a|To help clarify whether food or enteral nutrients decrease hydralazine relative bioavailability, eight subjects were given oral hydralazine under four nutritional conditions: fasted (F), with a standard breakfast (SB), with a bolus of enteral nutrients (EB), and with a slow infusion of enteral nutrients administered by nasogastric tube (EI). The area under the curve and maximum concentration values were much higher under the fasted and enteral infusion conditions than under the standard breakfast or enteral bolus conditions, indicating that the absorption and/or disposition kinetics of hydralazine may be altered by food. The median (range) values for these parameters were 2,641 (385-4,747) and 87 (4.5-224) for F; 1,189 (202-1,737) and 15 (3.5-33.9) for SB; 999 (227-3,576) and 11 (2.5-50) for EB; and 3,068 (313-4,917) ng/ml/min and 113 (3.6-235) ng/ml for EI. Furthermore, the rate of nutrient administration, but not necessarily the physical form, of the nutrients appears to be a significant factor in determining the magnitude of the food effect. The nutrient interaction should be accounted for in patients receiving hydralazine and enteral nutrition concomitantly.

23769831|t|Bacterial expression, purification and angiogenesis-promoting activity of human thymosin b4.
23769831|a|Thymosin b4 (Tb4) is an actin-binding peptide involved in tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. This 43-amino acid peptide is chemically synthesized for research or clinical trials. To overcome the high costs of solid phase synthesis, we developed a genetic engineering procedure of Tb4 expression in a protease-deficient host strain, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), transformed with different expression vectors (pRSETA, pET-15b and pEcoli-Cterm6 × HN). The recombinant, non-glycosylated peptide was overexpressed in soluble form and purified by two-step immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Use of the pET vector expression system allowed for easy removal of the polyhistidine tag by thrombin. Functional studies revealed that recombinant Tb4 stimulated angiogenesis via activation of the endothelial proteolytic systems, inhibition of endothelial cell adhesion, promotion of migration and capillary tube formation in Matrigel, and that its activity was similar to that observed for the synthetic peptide. The presented study comprises the first evidence that recombinant Tb4 promotes angiogenesis in an in vitro endothelial cell model.

21509688|t|Therapy of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
21509688|a|Despite considerable improvements in first line treatment still the majority of patients experience relapse of multiple myeloma. Treatment decisions for relapse or refractory multiple myeloma should be based on a clinical decision path taking response and adverse events to previous therapy, myeloma specific complications and organ dysfunctions, overall clinical condition, age, cytogenetic information and prognostic factors into account. Bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide have improved the therapeutic armentarium for patients with refractory or relapsed disease and are often used in combination with dexamethasone or chemotherapeutic agents. Combination therapies of novel agents in drug combination regimen are currently under investigation as well. For patients with a disease free survival of 12 month or longer after initial single or tandem high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) repeat of high dose therapy with melphalan and ASCT should be considered in case of relapse. Radiotherapy and osteoplastic procedures can be used as adjunct to systemic therapy to treat local complications in particular vertebral pain caused by osteolytic bone disease. Cytogenetic tests, molecular techniques as gene expression profiling and other diagnostic will lead to a more individualized therapy. The integration of novel compounds into established regimen will be a major challenge for future clinical studies.

15718366|t|Effect of dexamethasone on B7 regulation and T cell activation in neonates and adults.
15718366|a|The safety of dexamethasone for neonates has been questioned, partly because of its multiple unspecific effects on the immune system. Specific effects of dexamethasone on co-stimulatory and immune suppressive functions of neonatal compared with adult macrophages (MPhi) are not known. We evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on the expression and regulation of MPhi B7 family receptors (B7-1, CD80; B7-2, CD86) and on their ability to co-stimulate T cells. Cord blood macrophages (CBMPhi) and MPhi from healthy adults (PBMPhi) were isolated, and cell surface markers were phenotyped by flow cytometry. In tissue culture, cells were exposed to dexamethasone, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), cAMP, or a T cell mitogen (alphaCD3) and examined for their capacity to activate or destroy T cells. CBMPhi were less able to up-regulate CD80 and CD86 than PBMPhi (p < 0.05). Dexamethasone inhibited the up-regulation of CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on PBMPhi and even more so on CBMPhi (p < 0.05 versus PBMPhi for CD80 and CD86). In the presence of dexamethasone, stimulation with alphaCD3 MAb enhanced cytotoxic functions of PMBMPhi and CB(mu)phi with an increase in deleted T cells, a reduced fraction of enlarged T cells, and an inhibition of T cell CD28 up-regulation, which again were more pronounced with CBMPhi (p < 0.05 versus PBMPhi). In conclusion, neonatal MPhi are exquisitely sensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on B7 expression. Although perhaps producing the desired therapeutic effect, dexamethasone may do so in newborns at the expense of a near complete paralysis of MPhi-dependent T cell function.

7994781|t|Results of adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive urothelial cancer with lymph-node metastasis.
7994781|a|From 1980 to 1991, 59 patients with advanced urothelial cancer (pathological stage, > pT3) underwent radical operations. Of these 59 patients, 33 had nodal involvement. This study focused on those 33 patients with nodal involvement. The primary site was the urinary bladder in 20 patients and the upper urinary tract (renal pelvis and/or ureter) in 13. In all, 13 patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with an M-VAC or M-VEC [methotrexate (M), vinblastine, doxorubicin (ADM) or epirubicin, and cisplatin (CDDP)] regimen, and another 8 patients were treated with other insufficient chemotherapies [CDDP + ADM or CDDP + ADM + etoposide (VP-16)]. A group of 12 patients did not receive any additional treatment. Most of the patients in the M-VAC and M-VEC groups received more than 2 cycles of the regimen (median, 3.2 cycles; range, 1-9 cycles). The overall 5-year survival rate of the M-VAC and M-VEC group was 31%, whereas the rate was 0 for the other insufficient-chemotherapy groups and the no-chemotherapy group. Of the 13 patients in the M-VAC group, 4 (31%) patients were alive without disease progression and 9 (69%) were dead due to progressive disease. In the other groups, only 1 patient was alive without progression. Our results suggest that adjuvant M-VAC or M-VEC chemotherapy may extend the median survival of patients with advanced urothelial cancer, but it failed to reduce the rate of cancer death.

17544264|t|Lung deposition and efficacy of inhaled formoterol in patients with moderate to severe COPD.
17544264|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of COPD on lung deposition of inhaled drugs and the relationship between lung-dose and response of pulmonary function measurements. METHODS: Nineteen patients with varying degrees of COPD were randomized to inhale single doses of formoterol (Oxis) Turbuhaler 4.5, 9, 18, and 36 microg in a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Urinary excreted formoterol during 32 h was used to determine absolute lung deposition. Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) and inhaled volume (IV) were recorded to assess the patients' ability to use Turbuhaler. Efficacy was measured by spirometry, inspiratory capacity (IC), airway conductance (sG(AW)), and absolute lung volumes. RESULTS: Mean pulmonary bioavailability of formoterol was about 24% of the nominal delivered dose after inhalation for the different treatments. No significant correlations between lung deposition and baseline FEV(1), PIF or IV were shown. All formoterol doses produced statistically significant increases in FEV(1), FVC, IC, and sG(AW) relative to placebo. Linear dose/response relationships were observed for these variables, with more narrow limits of the slopes for the lung-dose/response relationships than for the nominal-dose/response relationships. Moreover, 36 and 18 microg formoterol statistically significantly decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This study could not show any difference in lung deposition of formoterol inhaled via Turbuhaler between patients with moderate and severe COPD. Moreover, the effect of formoterol on various pulmonary function measurements were more closely related to lung deposition than the inhaled nominal dose.

25082878|t|Ser70 phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by selective tyrosine nitration of PP2A-B56Î´ stabilizes its antiapoptotic activity.
25082878|a|Bcl-2 is frequently overexpressed in hematopoietic malignancies, and selective phosphorylation at ser70 enhances its antiapoptotic activity. Phospho-ser70 is dephosphorylated by specific heterotrimers of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We report here that a mild pro-oxidant intracellular milieu induced by either pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) inhibits the functional holoenzyme assembly of PP2A and prevents Bcl-2 ser70 dephosphorylation. This redox-dependent regulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation is due to nitrosative modification of B56Î´, which we identify as the regulatory subunit mediating PP2A-dependent Bcl-2 dephosphorylation. Redox inhibition of PP2A results from peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of a conserved tyrosine residue within B56Î´ (B56Î´(Y289)). Although nitrated B56Î´(Y289) binds efficiently to ser70-phosphorylated Bcl-2, this specific modification inhibits the recruitment of the PP2A catalytic core (A and C subunits). Furthermore, inhibition of B56Î´(Y289) nitration restores PP2A holoenzyme assembly, thereby permitting S70 dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 and inhibiting its antiapoptotic activity. More important, in primary cells derived from clinical lymphomas, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at S70 directly correlates with B56Î´ nitration and repression of SOD1, but inversely correlates with B56Î´ interaction with the PP2A-C catalytic subunit. These data underscore the role of a pro-oxidant milieu in chemoresistance of hematopoietic and other cancers via selective targeting of tumor suppressors such as PP2A.

10796863|t|Tricyclic and related drugs for nocturnal enuresis in children.
10796863|a|BACKGROUND: Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially unacceptable and stressful condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults. Although there is a high rate of spontaneous remission, the social, emotional and psychological costs to the children can be great. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of tricyclic and related drugs on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare them with other interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE to June 1997; AMED; ASSIA; BIDS; BIOSIS Previews (1985-1996); CINAHL; DHSS Data; EMBASE (1974 to June 1997); PsycLIT and SIGLE. Organisations, manufacturers, researchers and health professionals concerned with enuresis were contacted for information. The reference sections of obtained studies were also checked for further trials. Date of the most recent search: July 1997. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials of tricyclic and related drugs for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review. Trials were eligible for inclusion if: children were randomised to receive tricyclics compared with placebo, other drugs or other conservative interventions for nocturnal bedwetting; participants with organic causes for their bedwetting were excluded; and baseline assessments of the level of bedwetting were provided. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty two randomised trials, involving 1100 children treated with tricyclic or related drugs, met the inclusion criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Only single trials compared tricyclic or related drugs with each other, other drugs, desmopressin, alarms or other behavioural interventions. Treatment with tricyclic drugs (such as imipramine, amitriptyline, viloxazine, clomipramine and desipramine but not mianserin) were associated with a reduction of about one wet night per week while on treatment (eg using imipramine, WMD -0.99, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.71). Children were almost five times more likely to achieve 14 dry nights with the drugs (eg using imipramine, RR = 4.99, 95% CI 2.4 to 10.40). Desmopressin and tricyclics appeared equally effective while on treatment, but this effect was not sustained after treatment stopped. There was no detectable difference between imipramine and alarms while on treatment, but afterwards those who had used alarms had one fewer wet night per week (WMD 1.03, 95% CI 0. 19 to 1.87). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tricyclic drugs (imipramine, amitriptyline, viloxazine, clomipramine and desipramine but not mianserin) was associated with a reduction of about one wet night per week while on treatment, but long term effectiveness is unknown. Desmopressin and tricyclics appeared equally effective while on treatment, but this effect was not sustained after treatment stopped. Alarms may be more effective in the long term. Comparisons between drug and behavioural treatments are needed, and should include relapse rates after treatment is finished.

20547798|t|Bacteremia due to extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter cloacae: role of carbapenem therapy.
20547798|a|Enterobacter cloacae is an important nosocomial pathogen. However, few studies specifically dealing with the clinical characteristics and outcome of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. cloacae infections have been published. During an 8-year period in a medical center, of 610 E. cloacae bacteremic isolates, 138 (22.6%) with ESBL genes were designated the ESBL group, and 120 (19.6%) cefotaxime-nonsusceptible isolates without the ESBL phenotype and genes were designated the control group. Of the former group of isolates, 133 (96.3%) carried the bla(SHV-12) gene, 3 (2.1%) had bla(CTX-M3), and 2 (1.4%) had both the bla(SHV-12) and bla(CTX-M3) genes. After patients under the age of 18 years were excluded, there were 206 adults with E. cloacae bacteremia, and these consisted of 121 patients in the ESBL group and 85 in the control group. More episodes of hospital-onset and polymicrobial bacteremia, increased severity of illness, more cases of bacteremia onset in intensive care units (ICUs), and longer stays in the hospital and ICU after bacteremia onset were noted in the ESBL group. However, the crude and sepsis-related mortality rates in two groups were similar. Of the ESBL group, the in-hospital sepsis-related mortality rate of patients definitively treated by a carbapenem was lower than that of those treated by noncarbapenem beta-lactams (5/53, or 9.4%, versus 13/44, or 29.5%; P = 0.01) though the difference was not significant in the hierarchical multivariate analysis (P = 0.46). Among 62 patients with follow-up blood cultures within 14 days of bacteremia onset, breakthrough bacteremia was more common in those treated by a noncarbapenem beta-lactam agent than in those treated by a carbapenem (18/31, or 58.0%, versus 3/31, or 9.6%; P < 0.001). Thus, carbapenem therapy for ESBL-producing E. cloacae that cause bacteremia may provide therapeutic benefits.

We present the case of a 32 year-old man who was involved in a road traffic accident in which he suffered a severe head injury. Four days following the trauma the patient developed post-traumatic central diabetes insipidus and desmopressin was started. At discharge of the intensive care unit, the patient was referred to us for endocrine assessment. Three months after the head injury, the hormonal evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by means of insulin stress test with the simultaneous administration of TRH and GnRH resulted in reduced responses of GH, cortisol, TSH, FSH, and LH with low baseline serum concentrations of free T4 and testosterone. Both serum basal and stimulated PRL concentrations were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated deformity of the sella turcica with displacement of the pituitary gland by a post-traumatic retention cyst. A new evaluation of the pituitary function performed 6 months after the trauma showed spontaneous recovery of the gonadal, thyroid and adrenal function. However, GH response was reduced both to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, clonidine and GHRH tests. Presence of normal serum PRL levels, normal PRL response to TRH and reduced GH responses to pituitary and hypothalamic stimuli suggests both hypothalamic and pituitary damage. The present case shows an unusual case of partial spontaneous resolution of a post-traumatic hypopituitarism. Based on this clinical observation we recommend periodic evaluation of the pituitary function in these kind of patients.

8259712|t|Granulocyte elastase in acute myocardial infarction.
8259712|a|Plasma concentrations of polymorphonuclear granulocytes elastase (PMN elastase) in complex with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor are a marker of neutrophil activation. The latter complex, creatine kinase and cardiac troponin T, were measured in peripheral venous blood samples serially drawn in 39 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Of the total, 29 received intravenous thrombolytic therapy either with streptokinase (n = 15), urokinase (n = 7) or recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (n = 7). Creatine kinase activities and cardiac troponin T concentrations were used as markers of myocardial tissue injury. In all patients with acute myocardial infarction, PMN elastase was elevated (median 80 micrograms/l, interquartile range 71 to 100 micrograms/l). Peak and cumulative (area under curve) concentrations of PMN elastase did not correlate closely with determinants of myocardial injury (r < 0.2, n.s.). PMN elastase increased during the first 6 h after starting thrombolytic therapy, whereas it decreased in conventionally treated patients and 12 h later increased. Maximum concentrations of PMN elastase, however, were not significantly higher in patients with thrombolytic therapy than in those without. In acute myocardial infarction patients with complications such as cardiac arrest with subsequent resuscitation (n = 5), cardiac rupture (n = 1) or cardiogenic shock (n = 2), PMN elastase plasma concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.04) than in uncomplicated infarctions. In the complicated patients, changes in elastase concentrations paralleled or even preceded changes in the clinical presentation. Therefore, thrombolytic treatment seems not to significantly influence the amount of systemic neutrophil activation, but plasma PMN elastase could be a useful marker to monitor and identify complications in acute myocardial infarction.

7986706|t|Effect of recombinant human interleukin-3 on haematological recovery from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
7986706|a|Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with ICE chemotherapy (ifosfamide 2000 mg/m2, days 1-3; carboplatin 300 mg/m2, day 1; etoposide 75 mg/m2, days 1-3) intravenously (i.v.) during the first 3 d of a maximum of four 28 d treatment cycles. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) was administered in cycles 2 and 4 as a daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injection on days 5-18. Cohorts of three patients were treated at dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 micrograms/kg/d. At 15.0 micrograms/kg/d a 'flu-like' syndrome of myalgias, arthralgias and fatigue was considered dose-limiting. Other toxicities were headache, fever, urticaria, arrhythmia, chills and flushing. Subsequently, nine patients were added to the group receiving 10 micrograms/kg/d. 27 patients received IL-3 after their second course of ICE. At 10 and 15 micrograms/kg/d, IL-3 in cycle 2 was associated with enhanced haematological recovery. Depth of neutrophil nadir and days of neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 10(9)/l) were reduced in 9/13 patients and in 8/11 patients, respectively. No effect was seen on platelet nadir or days of thrombocytopenia. IL-3 was well tolerated up to 10 micrograms/kg/d when given as a daily s.c. injection. Results suggest IL-3 as a potential adjunct to chemotherapy, and further studies to explore administration of IL-3 in combination with other cytokines in this setting are warranted.

15361908|t|Outcomes of unrelated cord blood transplants and allogeneic-related hematopoietic stem cell transplants in children with high-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia.
15361908|a|Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a common indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children. Use of unrelated cord blood (UCB) has become increasingly popular as a stem cell source, given the rapid availability and decreased GVHD potential. Publications describing outcomes of children with leukemia who underwent UCB transplants have compared them to those having received unrelated donor marrow transplants. Results are similar. We compared our outcomes using UCB vs allogeneic-related hematopoietic stem cells in pediatric ALL patients since 1992. A total of 49 patients were analyzed. All patients were either in CR1 with high-risk features (n=21) or in CR2 (n=28) with initial remission less than 36 months. Patients received myeloablation with fractionated total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide and GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Antithymocyte globulin was added for UCB recipients to address the HLA differences. In all, 23 patients underwent allogeneic -related HSCT and 26 underwent UCB transplantation. Other than increased time to engraftment for UCB recipients, results are equivalent. The 3-year overall survival is 64% and 3-year event-free survival is 60% for both groups. Rates of GVHD and transplant-related mortality are also equivalent. UCB is a reasonable option for children with ALL who are referred for HSCT.

11172823|t|Low seminal plasma folate concentrations are associated with low sperm density and count in male smokers and nonsmokers.
11172823|a|OBJECTIVE: To measure folate levels in seminal plasma from smokers and nonsmokers and to evaluate relationships between seminal plasma folate levels and both folate nutriture and semen quality measures. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: United States Department of Agriculture, Western Human Nutrition Research Center, Presidio of San Francisco, San Francisco, California. PATIENT(S): Healthy male smokers (n=24) and nonsmokers (n=24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Blood levels of plasma folate and homocysteine, seminal plasma total, non-methyl- and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations, and total sperm count and density. RESULTS: Total seminal plasma folate concentrations were on average 1.5 times higher than blood plasma folate concentrations in all men. Seminal plasma folates contained 5-methyltetrahyrdofolate (74% of total) and non-methyltetrahydrofolates (26% of total); all samples had less than four glutamyl residues. Total and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations correlated significantly with blood plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations. Seminal plasma non-methyltetrahydrofolate levels correlated significantly with sperm density and total sperm count. Seminal plasma of smokers contained a proportionally lower concentration of non-methyltetrahydrofolates compared with nonsmokers. CONCLUSION(S): Seminal plasma total folate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations reflect folate nutriture. The non-methyltetrahydrofolate fraction of seminal plasma may be important for male reproductive function.

9242514|t|p53 mutation in squamous cell carcinomas from psoriasis patients treated with psoralen + UVA (PUVA).
9242514|a|Individuals suffering from psoriasis are treated with a combination of psoralen and UVA radiation, commonly referred to as "PUVA" therapy. Epidemiologic studies have shown that PUVA therapy is a risk factor for skin cancer in psoriasis patients. Although PUVA treatment induces skin cancer in laboratory animals, it is unknown whether the increased incidence of skin cancer reported in PUVA-treated psoriasis patients is due to the carcinogenic effects of PUVA or due to other factors such as UVB. Because UV and PUVA induce different types of DNA damage resulting in unique types of p53 mutation, we investigated whether skin cancers from PUVA-treated psoriasis patients have PUVA-type or UV-type p53 mutations. Analysis of 17 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from Austrian PUVA-treated patients revealed a total of 25 p53 mutations in 11 SCCs. A majority of p53 mutations occurred at 5'TpG sites. Although previous studies have shown that 5'TpA sites are the primary targets for PUVA mutagenesis, substitutions at 5'TpG sites are also quite common. Interestingly, a sizable portion of p53 mutations detected were C-->T or CC-->TT transitions, characteristic of UV-induced mutations. Because some psoriasis patients had substantial exposure to UVB before PUVA therapy and because the light sources used in PUVA therapy contained small but significant wavelengths in the UVB region, it is possible that the C-->T and CC-->TT transitions detected in SCCs from PUVA-treated patients were induced by UVB. Nonetheless, our results indicate that both PUVA and UVB may play a role in the development of skin cancer in Austrian psoriasis patients who undergo PUVA therapy.

24513111|t|Ophthalmic manifestations of IgG4-related disease: single-center experience and literature review.
24513111|a|OBJECTIVES: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an inflammatory disorder responsible for fibrosing, tumefactive lesions that can involve the lacrimal gland as well as the extraocular muscles, orbital soft tissues, sclera, and local nerves. We reviewed IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD), including the natural history, pathology, and treatment, based on our center's experience and that reported in the literature. METHODS: We identified 27 patients with orbital manifestations from our IgG4-RD registry; six were excluded because no pathology was available for review. All 21 cases included had histopathologically confirmed diagnoses of IgG4-RD, 11 of which were of the orbital tissue. Other data were obtained by a retrospective medical records review. MEDLINE and PubMed literature searches in English were conducted to identify articles for a literature review on the topic. RESULTS: Patients with IgG4-ROD were predominantly male (57%) and had an average age at symptom onset of 50 years (range: 21-79 years). The lacrimal gland was the most commonly involved structure (62%). Most patients (71%) had bilateral disease and extra-orbital involvement (71%); these patients also had elevated serum IgG4 concentrations compared to those with unilateral disease and no extra-orbital disease. Ten patients improved following rituximab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic involvement is a common manifestation of IgG4-RD and can affect nearly every orbital structure. Consideration of IgG4-RD and accurate diagnosis by biopsy have important implications for prognosis and treatment following the distinction of this condition from the SjÃ¶gren syndrome (SjS), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's), sarcoidosis, lymphoma, infection, and other disorders. Rituximab holds promise as an effective steroid-sparing agent or therapy for steroid-resistant cases.

21049517|t|High-dose carboplatin-irinotecan-temozolomide: treatment option for neuroblastoma resistant to topotecan.
21049517|a|BACKGROUND: We report a retrospective study of a novel regimen for neuroblastoma (NB) resistant to standard induction or salvage chemotherapy which now routinely includes topotecan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients received carboplatin (500 mg/m(2)/day, 2×)-irinotecan (50 mg/m(2)/day, 5×)-temozolomide (250 mg/m(2)/day, 5×) (HD-CIT). Only one course was planned. Patients with thrombocytopenia indicative of poor bone marrow (BM) reserve resulting from extensive prior therapy received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) post-HD-CIT. RESULTS: Modest acute toxicity allowed outpatient treatment. Low-grade diarrhea was common; there was no mucositis, nephrotoxicity, or cardiotoxicity. Myelosuppression was prolonged but uncomplicated. The absolute neutrophil count reached 500/ µl on days 20-30 (median, 25) in 25 patients with satisfactory BM reserve, and on days 9-14 (median, 11) post-PBSC infusion. Anti-NB activity was common against refractory (non-progressing) disease or new relapse occurring off therapy (68% objective response rate), but not against disease progressing on therapy. Seven of 26 patients treated for refractory NB are progression-free and in complete remission following subsequent therapy, including anti-G(D2) immunotherapy, at >=  29+ months post-HD-CIT. CONCLUSIONS: HD-CIT is appealing as salvage or consolidative therapy because of anti-NB activity and modest non-hematologic toxicity. PBSC support is unnecessary when BM reserve is intact. The wide antineoplastic activity of its three components and their potential for activity against disease in the central nervous system support applicability to other cancers.

8844795|t|Heterocyclic amine mutagenicity/carcinogenicity: influence of repair, metabolism, and structure.
8844795|a|Cooking, heat processing, and pyrolysis of protein-rich foods induce the formation of structurally related heterocyclic aromatic amines that have been found to be mutagenic in bacteria, mammalian cells in culture and mice. All these compounds are potent mutagens and most are active below 1 ng/plate, in Ames/Salmonella tester strain TA1538 in the presence of S9 liver microsomal preparations from rat, mouse, or hamster. They are also potent in strains TA98, TA97, moderately active in TA1537, weakly active in TA100, and virtually inactive in TA1535 and TA102. Thus, they show powerful frameshift activity in reverting specific GC-rich sequences, but do not cause base substitution mutations or revert an AT-rich sequence. They are 100-fold less active in the uvrB+, repair-proficient strain TA1978, and in the case of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f] quinoline (IQ), cause insertions and large deletions not seen in TA1538.

12627041|t|The early response of the postmenopausal endometrium to tamoxifen: expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and Ki-67 antigen.
12627041|a|OBJECTIVE: To enlighten the early response of endometrium to tamoxifen by assessing the expression of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, Ki-67, and the histological response in endometria from normal postmenopausal women treated for 21 days with tamoxifen. DESIGN: A total of 40 women, scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy because of uterine prolapse, were randomly assigned to the tamoxifen group (20 mg/day; 20 women) or the control group (20 women). Samples were obtained from the upper and the lower thirds of the uterine cavity. Standard immunohistochemical staining of estrogen and progesterone receptors and of Ki-67 was performed on frozen sections. Staining was assessed using semiquantitative immunoreactivity scores. RESULTS: Simple endometrial hyperplasia was diagnosed in 18 of the 20 samples exposed to tamoxifen compared with only 2 of the 20 controls ( P< 0.0005). Staining was increased in both the epithelium and stroma in the tamoxifen samples, a difference that was significant for estrogen receptors in glandular epithelium (180 +/- 80 v 110 +/- 110; P< 0.05). Also, Ki-67 antigen was expressed more frequently in both glandular epithelium ( P< 0.05) and stroma ( P< 0.05) in the tamoxifen samples. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen rapidly up-regulated the cell proliferation markers, an effect that was associated with enhanced growth as confirmed by increased expression of estrogen receptors and Ki-67, in addition to a high incidence of glandular hyperplasia.

9740243|t|Thymidine dinucleotides induce S phase cell cycle arrest in addition to increased melanogenesis in human melanocytes.
9740243|a|Although the induction of pigmentation following exposure of melanocytes to ultraviolet light in vivo and in vitro is well documented, the intracellular mechanisms involved in this response are not yet fully understood. Exposure to UV-B radiation leads to the production of DNA damage, mainly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and it was recently suggested that the thymidine dinucleotide pTpT, mimicking small DNA fragments released in the course of excision repair mechanisms, could trigger melanin synthesis. We now report that the thymidine dinucleotide pTpT induces melanogenesis both in human normal adult melanocytes and in human melanoma cells. Thus, the SOS-like response suggested by Gilchrest's work to be evolutionary conserved, based primarily on work in murine cells and guinea pigs, is also apparently present in the human. Thymidine dinucleotide is nontoxic to melanoma cells and does not induce apoptosis in these cells, but induces S phase cell cycle arrest and a proliferation slow down. Because thymidine excess in culture medium leads to the synchronization of cells in S phase, we investigated whether this phenomenon was involved in the increase in melanin synthesis. We show that melanin synthesis is specifically triggered by the dimeric form of the thymidine and not by the monomeric form pT. Thus, our data strongly support that thymidine dinucleotides pTpT mimic at least part of the effects of ultraviolet irradiation, and may hence represent an invaluable model in the study of the molecular events involved in melanogenesis induction triggered through DNA damage.

9461358|t|Control of a nosocomial outbreak of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium in a paediatric oncology unit: risk factors for colonisation.
9461358|a|In order to determine the extent of vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) colonisation within a paediatric oncology unit, the risk factors for the acquisition of the organism, the molecular epidemiology of the isolates and the impact of infection control measures, extensive patient and environmental surveillance was undertaken with identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of all VRE isolates. A matched case control study was carried out. Fourteen patients (19% of screened patients) with VRE colonisation were identified (12 with Enterococcus faecium). All isolates manifested the Van A phenotype. Extensive environmental contamination with VRE was present. PFGE of E. faecium isolates from 10 patients and from five of six environmental cultures revealed patterns suggesting genetic relatedness. Following comparison of the 14 cases with 41 controls matched for age (+/- 4 years) and cohabitation on the oncology unit, risk factors for colonisation with VRE included duration of neutropenia, (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.0-13.1), and antibiotic therapy, (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.08-15.3), the number of antibiotic agents received, (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.34-34.3) and the duration of therapy with amikacin, (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 1.4-81.5), ceftazidime, (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.2 59.9) or teicoplanin, (OR, 12.3; 95% CI, 2.25-67.4). Implementation of stringent infection control measures reduced environmental contamination from 25% of samples in week 1 to none in week 11. Two additional colonised patients were identified during the subsequent 6 months. CONCLUSION: Risk factors for VRE colonization in paediatric oncology patients included duration of neutropenia, duration of any antibiotic therapy, exposure to ceftazidime, amikacin or teicoplanin and the number of antibiotics used. The study suggests that environmental contamination played an important role in patient-to-patient transmission of VRE and interventions including implementation of infection control measures were associated with a decreased incidence of gastro-intestinal colonisation.

8615834|t|Expression in Escherichia coli, purification and characterization of heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum.
8615834|a|The use of heparin for extracorporeal therapies has been problematical due to haemorrhagic complications; as a consequence, heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum is used for the determination of plasma heparin and for elimination of heparin from circulation. Here we report the expression of recombinant heparinase I in Escherichia coli, purification to homogeneity and characterization of the purified enzyme. Heparinase I was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The enzyme was insoluble and inactive, but could be refolded, and was purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The cumulative yield was 43%, and the recovery of purified heparinase I was 14.4 mg/l of culture. The N-terminal sequence and the molecular mass as analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption MS were consistent with predictions from the heparinase I gene structure. The reverse-phase HPLC profile of the tryptic digest, the Michaelis-Menten constant Km (47 micrograms/ml) and the specific activity (117 units/mg) of purified recombinant heparinase I were similar to those of the native enzyme. Degradation of heparin by heparinase I results in a characteristic product distribution, which is different from those obtained by degradation with heparinase II or III from F. heparinum. We developed a rapid anion-exchange HPLC method to separate the products of enzymic heparin degradation, using POROS perfusion chromatography media. Separation of characteristic di-, tetra- and hexa-saccharide products is performed in 10 min. These methods for the expression, purification and analysis of recombinant heparinase I may facilitate further development of heparinase I-based medical therapies as well as further investigation of the structures of heparin and heparan sulphate and their role in the extracellular matrix.

16226725|t|The ethyl pyruvate analogues, diethyl oxaloproprionate, 2-acetamidoacrylate, and methyl-2-acetamidoacrylate, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in vivo and/or in vitro.
16226725|a|Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a simple aliphatic ester derived from the endogenous metabolite, pyruvic acid. EP has been shown to decrease the expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO*), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin (IL)-6, in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems. In an effort to better understand the chemical features that might explain the anti-inflammatory properties of EP, we screened 15 commercially available compounds for cytoprotective or anti-inflammatory effects using two in vitro assay systems: TNF and NO* production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cells and changes in the permeability of Caco-2 human enterocyte-like monolayers stimulated with a cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines called cytomix (1000U/ml IFN-gamma plus 10ng/ml TNF-alpha plus 1ng/ml IL-1beta). Two compounds, namely diethyl oxaloproprionate (DEOP) and 2-acetamidoacrylate (2AA), demonstrated consistent anti-inflammatory or cytoprotective pharmacological properties in this screening process. Treatment of mice with either of these compounds ameliorated LPS-induced ileal mucosal hyperpermeability to the fluorescent probe, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (average molecular mass 4kDa), and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes. Treatment with either of these compounds also improved survival in mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. Finally, in a study that compared 2AA to its methyl ester, we showed that methyl-2-acetamidoacrylate is at least 100-fold more potent than the parent carboxylate as an inhibitor of LPS-induced NO* production by RAW 264.7 cells. Collectively, these data are consistent with the view that anti-inflammatory activity is demonstrable for a number of compounds that either incorporate an olefinic linkage conjugated to a carbonyl moiety or are capable of undergoing tautomeric rearrangement to form such a structure. Moreover, our findings suggest that esters with these general characteristics, perhaps because of their greater lipophilicity or electrophilicity, are more potent anti-inflammatory agents than are the parent carboxylates.

15953991|t|Anti-inflammatory effect of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) in microglial cells.
15953991|a|OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study how different SERMs modulate the inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or unmethylated CpG-oligonucleotides in mouse and rat microglial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammatory responses of mouse N9 microglial cells and rat primary hippocampal microglia to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure were recorded by the secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine IL-6 in two models where SERM was added either 24 h before LPS addition or simultaneously or even after the LPS exposure. The responses of 17beta-estradiol, tamoxifen, raloxifene and ICI 182.780 were compared. Responses were recorded by ELISA, Northern and EMSA assays. RESULTS: SERMs but not 17beta-estradiol induced a significant, concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory response both in rat primary microglial cells and in mouse N9 microglial cells. The response was observed both in NO and IL-6 secretion as well as in total IL-6 mRNA expression. We have recently observed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can potentiate the LPS-induced inflammatory response. Raloxifene and tamoxifen inhibited the potentiation of LPS response induced by trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, in N9 microglia. A SERM-induced anti-inflammatory response was observed in acute models where SERM was added simultaneously or even up to 6 h later than LPS exposure. In contrast, the pretreatment of N9 microglia with tamoxifen or raloxifene for 30 h before LPS exposure did not provide any protection against the LPS response. We also observed that the raloxifene-induced protection in N9 microglia was connected to a decline of LPS-induced DNA binding activity of AP-1 but not that of NF-kappaB transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that tamoxifen, raloxifene and ICI 182.780 induce an anti-inflammatory response in acute models of mouse and rat microglial cells. It seems that this response is not estrogen receptor-mediated but, probably, is attributable to some SERM-induced modulation of LPS-activated pro-inflammatory signalling cascades.

12149733|t|Direct-puncture embolization of intraosseous arteriovenous malformation of jaws.
12149733|a|PURPOSE: Our goal was to report our experience with direct-puncture embolization of intraosseous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three cases of AVM in the mandible and 2 cases of AVM in the maxilla comprised this study group. The patients were embolized with fiber coils through direct puncture, and the coils were placed directly into the center of the intraosseous lesion, in some cases in conjunction with polyvinyl alcohol foam and N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate through vascular access. RESULTS: The acute arterial bleeding was controllable in 3 patients. The other 2 patients had pericoronal oozing bleeding and a warm soft pulsative mass on the left face, respectively; their symptoms and signs improved greatly. The pericoronal oozing of blood in all patients disappeared during a 3- to 13-month follow-up, and new bone formation was found on the follow-up radiography. CONCLUSIONS: The embolization of the AVM of jaws by direct percutaneous puncture in conjunction with endovascular therapy is effective and safe, but longer follow-up is required to determine the true efficacy of this method of treatment.

19196834|t|FSH and FOXO1 regulate genes in the sterol/steroid and lipid biosynthetic pathways in granulosa cells.
19196834|a|The forkhead box transcription factor FOXO1 is highly expressed in granulosa cells of growing follicles but is down-regulated by FSH in culture or by LH-induced luteinization in vivo. To analyze the function of FOXO1, we infected rat and mouse granulosa cells with adenoviral vectors expressing two FOXO1 mutants: a gain-of-function mutant FOXOA3 that has two serine residues and one threonine residue mutated to alanines rendering this protein constitutively active and nuclear and FOXOA3-mutant DNA-binding domain (mDBD) in which the DBD is mutated. The infected cells were then treated with vehicle or FSH for specific time intervals. Infection of the granulosa cells was highly efficient, caused only minimal apoptosis, and maintained FOXO1 protein at levels of the endogenous protein observed in cells before exposure to FSH. RNA was prepared from control and adenoviral infected cells exposed to vehicle or FSH for 12 and 24 h. Affymetrix microarray and database analyses identified, and real time RT-PCR verified, that genes within the lipid, sterol, and steroidogenic biosynthetic pathways (Hmgcs1, Hmgcr, Mvk, Sqle, Lss, Cyp51, Tm7sf2, Dhcr24 and Star, Cyp11a1, and Cyp19), including two key transcriptional regulators Srebf1 and Srebf2 of cholesterol biosynthesis and steroidogenesis (Nr5a1, Nr5a2), were major targets induced by FSH and suppressed by FOXOA3 and FOXOA3-mDBD in the cultured granulosa cells. By contrast, FOXOA3 and FOXOA3-mDBD induced expression of Cyp27a1 mRNA that encodes an enzyme involved in cholesterol catabolism to oxysterols. The genes up-regulated by FSH in cultured granulosa cells were also induced in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles and corpora lutea collected from immature mice primed with FSH (equine choriogonadotropin) and LH (human choriogonadotropin), respectively. Conversely, Foxo1 and Cyp27a1 mRNAs were reduced by these same treatments. Collectively, these data provide novel evidence that FOXO1 may play a key role in granulosa cells to modulate lipid and sterol biosynthesis, thereby preventing elevated steroidogenesis during early stages of follicle development.

19887953|t|Nitroglycerin prescription and potency in patients participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.
19887953|a|PURPOSE: Current guidelines call for nitroglycerin to be prescribed in patients with coronary heart disease, including those with stable angina and those recovering from acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. These patients are at risk for coronary events, and nitroglycerin may be required to treat acute symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Nitroglycerin rapidly loses potency when stored improperly, compromising effectiveness. Previous studies indicate that patients frequently fail to store nitroglycerin properly. Accordingly, pharmacists routinely advise patients to renew nitroglycerin tablets every 6 months. The purpose of this study was to determine frequency of prescription of nitroglycerin and the relationship to potency in patients participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. METHODS: A survey was performed over a 3-month period of 617 patients enrolled in 9 exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation centers in New York, Michigan, and Rhode Island. Patient data were evaluated according to cardiac diagnoses and the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. RESULTS: A total of 38% of patients did not have a prescription for nitroglycerin. Patients with potentially subpotent nitroglycerin tablets included 23% whose prescription was older than 1 year and an additional 15% whose tablets were between 6 and 12 months old. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of nitroglycerin is frequently omitted in patients with coronary heart disease. Those who are prescribed nitroglycerin frequently carry a potentially subpotent medication. Education is necessary for both patients and physicians. The findings have implications for counseling patients who are enrolled in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs.

24576440|t|Therapeutic effects of local application of dexamethasone during bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy surgery.
24576440|a|PURPOSE: Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO) is one of the most common procedures used in the treatment of mandibular deformity. One common complication of this surgical procedure is hypoesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve. The authors hypothesized that perioperative local application of dexamethasone would have positive therapeutic effects on neurosensory function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated 18 patients (10 male, 8 female; mean age, 26.1  ± 4.9 yr) who underwent BSSO. One side of each patient's mandible was randomly selected as the control side and the opposite side as the experimental side. A solution of dexamethasone 4 mg/1 mL was drawn into a syringe and poured directly on the distal segment of the exposed inferior alveolar nerve during splitting and 1 mL was poured on the same nerve immediately before the start of fixation. Neurosensory tests, including light touch, direction of movement, static 2-point touch, thermal stimuli, and pin prick discrimination, were conducted. The Ï(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: The difference between the control and experimental groups at all intervals was not significant for any of the neurosensory tests. CONCLUSION: Local application of dexamethasone on the exposed inferior alveolar nerve during BSSO is not recommended.

16054129|t|Retinoic acid-induced downmodulation of telomerase activity in human cancer cells.
16054129|a|Most human cancers express telomerase but its activity is highly variable and regulated by complex mechanisms. Recently, several studies have suggested that retinoic acid (RA) downregulates telomerase activity and that this effect could be a major determinant of its therapeutic activity. To elucidate possible mechanisms of RA-mediated downmodulation of telomerase activity, we measured the kinetics of concentration changes of several transcription regulators by using standard biochemical techniques at low (10 muM) and high (100 muM) RA concentrations. We further evaluated the global impact of the RA treatment on gene expression profiles using microarray. It was found that the kinetics of c-Myc correlates most closely with the telomerase activity suggesting in agreement with previous studies that this protein is a major intermediate of the RA-induced downregulation of telomerase activity. Other telomerase regulators as Sp1 and Mad1 did not exhibit significant correlation. The dominant role of c-Myc in RA-induced telomerase downmodulation is confirmed by microarray data. Additionally, a number of proteins were found as possible correlates of telomerase activity by microarray analysis. These data suggest a complex interplay between c-Myc and other proteins that may be important determinants of the RA effects on telomerase activity in human cancer cells. The complex mechanism through which telomerase activity is controlled during differentiation and cancer transformation is also reflected.

17509511|t|Alterations in endothelial cell density after photorefractive keratectomy with adjuvant mitomycin.
17509511|a|PURPOSE: To elucidate the distinct role of the intraoperative use of mitomycin C (MMC) on endothelial cell density after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in human eyes. DESIGN: Prospective, double-masked, randomized clinical trial. METHODS: One eye of 15 patients was treated with PRK with intraoperative use of topical 0.02% MMC (15 seconds), whereas the fellow eye was treated with Epipolis laser in situ keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK) in random order. Corneal confocal microscopy was performed in all eyes preoperatively and at one, three, six, and 12 months after the surgery. Moreover, three endothelial images were acquired in each of 15 preoperative-normal eyes to evaluate the repeatability of measuring endothelial cell density. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the temporal variations of endothelial cell density between the two techniques and the changes of endothelial cell density over time. RESULTS: The coefficient of repeatability of endothelial cell count was 148 cells/mm(2). Preoperative endothelial cell density was not significantly different between the two groups (P = .82). Moreover, the effect of the treatment on the temporal variation of endothelial cell density was insignificant (P = .83), whereas the differences between the preoperative and the postoperative endothelial cell densities reached statistical significance (P <or= .05). Nonetheless, inclusion of the repeatability of the instrument on the analysis diminished these significant differences (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic intraoperative application of MMC (up to 15 seconds) after PRK does not seem to affect the endothelial cell density.

17608830|t|Intravitreal triamcinolone as adjunctive treatment to laser panretinal photocoagulation for concomitant proliferative diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular oedema.
17608830|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) combined with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) on visual acuity (VA) and foveal thickness in patients with concomitant high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO). METHODS: This retrospective interventional case series included seven eyes diagnosed with both high-risk PDR and CSMO that underwent PRP and a single injection of 4 mg of IVTA. The main outcome measures were VA and foveal thickness, measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) before treatment and throughout the follow-up period. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 301 days (range 180-715 days). Foveal thickness data were available for four of seven eyes. Before the combined treatment, median LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) VA and median foveal thickness were 1 (Snellen 20/200, range 20/40-20/800) and 559 microm (range 333-689 microm), respectively. After treatment, median vision improved to LogMAR 0.544 (Snellen 20/70, range 20/40-20/1000) (P = 0.13). Vision improved or remained stable in six of seven eyes. Median foveal thickness at final follow-up was 436 microm (range 259-623 microm) (P = 0.15). Foveal thickness decreased or remained stable in all eyes. CONCLUSION: The addition of IVTA to PRP in the treatment of eyes with high-risk PDR and CSMO may prevent PRP-induced foveal thickening and loss of vision.

12356918|t|Functional role of alpha-actinin, PI 3-kinase and MEK1/2 in insulin-like growth factor I receptor kinase regulated motility of human breast carcinoma cells.
12356918|a|Within epithelial tissue, cells are held together by specialized lateral junctions. At particular stages of development and in pathological processes such as metastasis, cells break down the intercellular junctions, separate from the epithelial sheet and migrate individually. Despite the importance of these processes, little is understood about the regulatory mechanisms of active cell separation. In view of the effects of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on mammary gland development and cancer, we developed a model using MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in which the process of cell separation can be induced by IGF-I. The separation was enhanced in MCF-7 cells overexpressing the IGF-IR and blocked in the cells expressing a dead-kinase mutant of this receptor. Activation of the IGF-IR resulted in a rapid formation of motile actin microspikes at the regions of cell-cell contacts, disorganization of mature adherens junctions and the onset of cell migration. In cell separation, the signaling between the IGF-IR kinase and actin required phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3)-kinase-generated phospholipids but not MAP kinases and was mediated by alpha-actinin. The activity of MEK1/2 kinases was needed for consecutive cell migration. This work also defined a new function for alpha-actinin. Upon IGF-IR activation, green fluorescence protein (GFP)-labeled alpha-actinin concentrated at the base of actin microspikes. Deletion of the N-terminal actin-binding domain of alpha-actinin prevented this redistribution, indicating that this domain is necessary. Detection of the C-terminal tail of alpha-actinin reduced the number of microspikes, showing that alpha-actinin has a role in the development of microspikes and is not passively reorganized with filamentous actin. We suggest that the signaling pathway from the IGF-IR kinase through the PI-3 kinase to alpha-actinin participates in the rapid organization of actin into microspikes at the cell-cell junctions and leads to active cell separation, whereas signaling through ERK1/2 MAP kinases controls cell migration following cell separation.

1708834|t|Tumor growth dependent on Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor inhibited by pentosan polysulfate.
1708834|a|A neoangiogenic response is critical for the unrestricted growth of solid tumors beyond a few millimeters in diameter. Release of adequate growth-stimulating activity from tumor cells is obviously required for the stimulation of blood vessel growth, and blockade of such stimulatory activity should repress tumor growth at the microscopic level. To test this hypothesis and to study appropriate inhibitors, we used a human adrenal cancer cell line (SW-13/K-fgf) engineered to secrete Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF), which we previously showed to induce growth of highly vascularized subcutaneous tumors in animals by autocrine and paracrine stimuli. In the present study, we tested different polysulfates for their selective inhibition of proliferation induced by K-FGF versus proliferation independent of K-FGF. Suramin and dextran sulfate showed slight selective inhibition of K-FGF-induced proliferation, ie, inhibition three- and five-fold greater, respectively, than the inhibition of proliferation independent of K-FGF. In contrast, heparin was inactive. The heparin analogue pentosan polysulfate (PPS), however, showed selective inhibition that was more than 2000-fold greater. The inhibitory effects of PPS on growth of SW-13/K-fgf cells, as well as endothelial cells, were fully reversible by an excess of added FGF. Daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS were tolerated well by athymic nude mice and prevented growth of subcutaneous SW-13/K-fgf tumor xenografts. PPS will be a useful tool to elucidate the effects of FGFs in vitro and in vivo and appears to be a prototype for the development of tumoricidal therapy based on targeting of growth factors.

15319023|t|Chart review for potential features of myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy in children and adolescents treated with clozapine.
15319023|a|Clozapine is known to cause cardiac side effects, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiomyopathy. Prompted by a case of clozapine-related pericarditis in an adolescent, we undertook a retrospective chart review to discover whether any unrecognized cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy were among the children, adolescents, and young adults we had treated with clozapine. The sample comprised a total of 36 patients, who were monitored regularly over a period ranging from 2.5 to 79 months. The average observation period was 7.5 months. Patients were assessed for potential indicators of myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. In more than 66% of all patients, at least one of several parameters potentially indicative of pericarditis, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy was abnormal in at least one instance during the observation period. In all cases in which abnormalities were discovered, the abnormalities were found to be unspecific for myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy. With the exception of the case which prompted our study, none of the patients were found to have developed any such disorder in the course of further treatment with clozapine.

12817105|t|Mannitol use in acute stroke: case fatality at 30 days and 1 year.
12817105|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mannitol is used worldwide to treat acute stroke, although its efficacy and safety have not been proven by randomized trials. METHODS: In a tricenter, prospective study, we analyzed the 30-day and 1-year case fatality with respect to mannitol treatment status in 805 patients consecutively admitted within 72 hours of stroke onset. Confounding factors were compared between treated and nontreated patients. RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients received intravenous mannitol as part of their routine treatment (mean dose, 47+/-22 g/d; mean duration, 6+/-3 days). The case fatality was 25% versus 16% (P=0.006) at 30 days and 38% versus 25% (P<0.001) at 1 year in the-mannitol treated and nontreated groups, respectively. Mannitol treatment effect was adjusted for age, stroke severity, fever in the first 3 days, and aspirin treatment (for ischemic strokes) in logistic regression models. Depending on the factors entered into the model, either no effect or harm could be attributed to mannitol. When the analysis was restricted to those admitted within 24 hours (n=568), case fatality differed significantly only at 1 year (35% in treated and 26% in nontreated patients, P=0.044). Although the prognostic scores of the Scandinavian Neurological Stroke Scale were similar in treated and nontreated patients, both in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the patient groups differed in several factors that might also have influenced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, no recommendations can be made on the use of mannitol in acute stroke, and properly randomized, controlled trials should be performed to come to a final conclusion.

25510715|t|Single-dose indigenous liposomal amphotericin B in the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis: a phase 2 study.
25510715|a|Liposomal amphotericin B is an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. In this study, we used a higher-dose regimen of an indigenously manufactured liposomal amphotericin B (FUNGISOME; L-AmBL), which was intended to improve the efficacy in terms of long-lasting cure rate. Thirty men and thirty women between 12 and 60 years old with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were enrolled in two cohorts of 15 patients each. Subjects in cohort I were administered one dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of L-AmBL intravenously. After the safety at this dose was confirmed in cohort I, patients were recruited in cohort II. They received one infusion of an escalated dose (15 mg/kg body weight). The safety of these two doses was evaluated over a period of 30 days, and efficacy was assessed for initial cure at day 30 and definitive cure at 6 months. FUNGISOME was found to be safe, with an initial cure rate of 100% at day 30 and a definitive cure rate of 93.3% at the 6-month follow-up in both the cohorts.

23339764|t|Beta-emitting radionuclides for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.
23339764|a|The paper focuses on the b-emitting radionuclides which might be useful for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, PRRT. For the effective design of the radiopharmaceutical, the choice of radionuclide will depend on the purpose for which the radioligand is being used and on the physicochemical properties of the radionuclide. The important factor is also the availability and the cost of production. The physical characteristics of several radionuclides which are currently used or can be considered as potential candidates for PRRT is provided, followed by short description of production methods and chemical aspects of their use in preparation of peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals. Somatostatin analogues labeled with radionuclides have been a successful example of PRRT. For treatment of patients with inoperable or metastasized neuroendocrine tumors, somatostatin analogues labeled with the radioisotopes (111)In, (90)Y and (177)Lu have been used so far. Labeling with (111)In, mainly an Auger electron emitter, resulted in no reduction of tumor size while somatostatin analogues labeled with (90)Y and (177)Lu gave overall positive response and improved the patients' quality of life. These promising results together with the increasing availability of other b-emitting radionuclides are a good basis for further studies.

16763722|t|Prostate androgen-regulated gene: a novel potential target for androgen-independent prostate cancer therapy.
16763722|a|AIM: To investigate the involvement of the prostate androgen-regulated (PAR) gene in the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway and the malignant phenotype of androgen-independent prostate cancer (PCa) cells. METHODS: The difference in PAR expression between LNCaP and PC3 cells was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Androgen and anti-androgen effects on PAR expression were evaluated by RT-PCR in LNCaP, PC3 cells and PC3 cells stably transfected with vector containing wild-type AR. To determine the importance of PAR in the malignant proliferation of androgen-independent PCa cells, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection to knock down the expression of the gene in PC3 cells. The changes in the malignant phenotype of PCa cells after transfection were analyzed by cell count, colony formation in soft agar and flow cytometry. RESULTS: PAR expression was 3-fold higher in PC3 cells than that in LNCaP cells. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) regulated PAR mRNA expression in LNCaP cells and the effect was inhibited by the AR antagonist, flutamide. By contrast, DHT did not affect PAR expression in PC3 cells. The reintroduction of AR into PC3 cells by stable transfection restored the androgen effect on PAR upregulation. After the knockdown of the PAR gene by siRNA, PC3 cells exhibited a reversal of the malignant phenotype. CONCLUSION: Because of the possibility that PAR is downstream from the AR, and because of its contribution to malignant proliferation in androgen-independent PCa cells, the gene could be a potential therapeutic target for androgen-independent PCa with AR signaling pathway alteration.

19159850|t|Metal allergic reaction in chronic refractory in-stent restenosis.
19159850|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between chronic refractory (CR) in-stent restenosis (ISR) and metal allergic reaction. BACKGROUND: Although drug-eluting stent reduced the restenotic event compared with bare-metal stent, the mechanism of neointimal proliferation is not clear yet; however, bare-metal stent still remains as one of the choices. METHODS: Of 128 bare-metal stent implanted patients who experienced target lesion revascularization at least once, 60 patients with the second ISR (study group) and 68 patients without the second ISR (control group) were compared in terms of result from the skin patch test for metal allergic reaction. RESULTS: Nickel was dominant among components of 316L stainless steel. The nickel-positive was observed in 19% (24/128) of all patients. Of 24 nickel-positive, 18 (30%) was in the study group, whereas 6 (9%) was in the control group (P=.02). According to multivariate analysis, the most significant predictor for CR-ISR was reference vessel diameter (P=.0010) followed by nickel-positive (P=.0033) and hyperlipidemia (P=.0305). The nickel-positive showed the highest odds ratio of 5.41 adjusted with confounder variables. CONCLUSION: This study with the second ISR showed that nickel was a major factor for CR-ISR. Further improvement of biocompatible material is required for coronary stents and strut-coating materials even in the drug-eluting stent era.

8341767|t|Effects of single dose haloperidol administration on plasma homovanillic acid levels in normal subjects.
8341767|a|Homovanillic acid (HVA), an oxidative metabolite of dopamine, has been shown in a number of studies to reflect severity of symptoms and to predict response to neuroleptic treatment in schizophrenic patients. In several clinical studies, HVA levels have been shown to have a positive relationship with symptom severity and to decline over time upon treatment with antipsychotic agents. The magnitude of this decline appears to be related to the degree of symptom reduction in patients so treated. However, administration of dopamine postsynaptic antagonists should be expected to increase synaptic dopamine availability, thereby increasing HVA concentrations, according to traditional models of drug action. While in some studies, this appears to be the case, we saw no evidence of an early phase of HVA elevation after administration of 4- and 10-milligram doses of haloperidol to human volunteers. Rather, HVA levels declined during the period of absorption and attainment of peak haloperidol levels. Baseline HVA levels of 51.6 +/- 3.83 pmoles/ml and 56.8 +/- 5.70 pmoles/ml (after 4 mg and 10 mg., respectively) declined to minima of 35.6 +/- 1.67 pmoles/ml and 26.3 +/- 5.34 pmoles/ml respectively, at 3-4 hours after haloperidol administration. A trend was noted for the 10-mg dose to produce a greater decline than the 4-mg dose, which was most apparent at 4 hours after drug administration. The shape of both curves did not appear to be substantially different than expected on the basis of diurnal variation. These preliminary findings support the concept that dopamine turnover in humans is not increased and may be decreased by short-term administration of conventional neuroleptics.

17131461|a|New derivatives of N-benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl-benzamidine 6 a were synthesized as nonacidic anti-inflammatory/antidegenerative agents. We investigated the influence of the amidines 6 a-j on the production of NO, PGE(2), MMP-3, COX-2, ROS, and GAGs, key molecules involved in cartilage destruction in osteoarthritic diseases. The antidegenerative properties of the novel designed derivatives 6 b-j were improved with respect to N-benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl-benzamidine 6 a. All of the compounds 6 a-j promoted the reduction of most of the IL-1beta-induced harmful effects. Derivatives 6 d, 6 h, and 6 j were the most potent of all the tested compounds, particularly in the human chondrocyte culture model.

15755853|t|Effects of potassium alkali and calcium supplementation on bone turnover in postmenopausal women.
15755853|a|Potassium citrate may improve calcium balance by conferring an alkali load. Calcium supplementation slows postmenopausal bone loss by inhibiting PTH secretion. This study explores whether combined treatment with potassium citrate and calcium citrate is more effective than either agent alone in inhibiting bone loss. In a crossover study involving 18 postmenopausal women, the following treatments were compared: potassium citrate (4.3 g or 40 mmol/d), calcium citrate (800 mg or 20 mmol/d), combined treatment, and placebo. During the last 2 d of each 2-wk phase, serum and 24-h urine were collected for assessment of calcium metabolism, alkali load, and bone turnover markers. Compared with placebo, potassium citrate provided an alkali load and significantly decreased urinary calcium without changing serum PTH (sPTH) or bone turnover markers. Calcium citrate significantly increased absorbed calcium, marginally decreased sPTH, and significantly reduced bone resorption markers. Combined treatment retained key features of potassium citrate and calcium citrate. However, more alkali was delivered than with potassium citrate alone, and absorbed calcium did not differ from calcium citrate alone. Compared with placebo, combined treatment increased urinary calcium, marginally reduced sPTH, provided a clear alkali load, and reduced the bone resorption markers serum type I collagen C-telopeptide and urinary N-telopeptide by 20.4% (P < 0.0001) and 18.2% (P = 0.005), respectively. A significant trend was noted for the decrease in bone resorption markers as treatment changed from placebo to potassium citrate to calcium citrate to combined treatment. In postmenopausal women, combined treatment with potassium citrate and calcium citrate inhibits bone resorption by providing an alkali load and increasing absorbed calcium.

9167507|t|Does risperidone improve verbal working memory in treatment-resistant schizophrenia?
9167507|a|OBJECTIVE: Treatment efficacy in schizophrenia is typically defined in terms of symptom reduction. However, new antipsychotic medications could potentially have an impact on aspects of disability, such as neurocognitive deficits. The authors evaluated the effects of risperidone on verbal working memory, a memory component of theoretical interest because of its link to prefrontal activity and of practical interest because of its link to psychosocial rehabilitation. METHOD: Verbal working memory of 59 treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients was assessed as part of a randomized, double-blind comparison of treatment with risperidone and haloperidol. Verbal working memory was measured under both distracting and nondistracting conditions at baseline and after 4 weeks of both fixed- and flexible-dose pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Risperidone treatment had a greater beneficial effect on verbal working memory than haloperidol treatment across testing conditions (with and without distraction) and study phases (fixed and flexible dose). The treatment effect remained significant after the effects of benztropine cotreatment, change in psychotic symptoms, and change in negative symptoms were controlled. Neither benztropine status nor symptom changes were significantly related to memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with risperidone appears to exert a more favorable effect on verbal working memory than treatment with a conventional neuroleptic. The beneficial effect appears to be due, at least partially, to a direct effect of the drug, possibly through antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor. Results from this study suggest that pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia treatment could be broadened to include impact on neurocognitive abilities.

17279352|t|A novel mechanism of action for statins against diabetes-induced oxidative stress.
17279352|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Atorvastatin exerts beneficial vascular effects in diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to determine whether Rac-1 is involved in the effect of atorvastatin on oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) we evaluated the effect of high glucose levels on peroxide production by dihydrodichlorofluorescein and on Rac-1 activity using immunocytochemistry to detect Rac-1 translocation to the membrane. We evaluated vascular function, peroxide production by dihydroethidium and NADPH oxidase activity in vessels from atorvastatin-treated mice. Rac-1 activity was also assessed, both by immunoprecipitation of the Rac-p21-activated kinase complex and by analysis of Rac-1 translocation to the membrane. These experiments were also conducted in vessels infected with an adenoviral vector carrying a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1. RESULTS: In HAECs exposed to high glucose levels, atorvastatin prevented oxidative stress, and this protection was associated with impaired Rac-1 activation. This effect was also observed in a murine model of diabetes mellitus. More importantly, the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) blocked the effects of atorvastatin in both glucose-exposed HAECs and diabetic vessels. Atorvastatin failed to afford protection against vascular abnormalities in the presence of a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results of this study demonstrate that the vascular antioxidant effect of atorvastatin in diabetes is mediated through inhibition of Rac-1 via a reduction in GGPP. Thus, selective Rac-1 inhibition should be considered in the design of novel pharmacological strategies to reduce the impact of diabetes mellitus on vascular function.

21036888|t|Comparison of the cortisol responses to testing with two doses of ACTH in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency.
21036888|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare the cortisol response of the 1µg and the 250µg ACTH test in a large study of patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Single center study assessing patients tested for primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency between January 2004 and December 2007, who had both ACTH tests (1µg and 250µg; n=207) within a time interval of 6 weeks. Test results were compared with a Bland-Altman plot and McNemar's test. RESULTS: The mean difference between the cortisol responses in the two ACTH tests was 26nmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI) 13, 40), showing a marginally higher response for the 250µg test. The diagnostic performances of the two tests were similar (P=0.49) using a cut-off value for cortisol of 550nmol/l. A normal cortisol response to the 1µg ACTH test could be accompanied by an abnormal response to the 250µg ACTH test, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the 1µg and the 250µg ACTH tests have comparable cortisol responses in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency. However, in individual patients, the difference in cortisol response to the two tests can be substantial, and the response in the 250µg test is not invariably higher than the response in a 1µg test.

10519894|t|Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma with intensive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and 13-cis-retinoic acid. Children's Cancer Group.
10519894|a|BACKGROUND: Children with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poor outcome. In this study, we assessed whether myeloablative therapy in conjunction with transplantation of autologous bone marrow improved event-free survival as compared with chemotherapy alone, and whether subsequent treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) further improves event-free survival. METHODS: All patients were treated with the same initial regimen of chemotherapy, and those without disease progression were then randomly assigned to receive continued treatment with myeloablative chemotherapy, total-body irradiation, and transplantation of autologous bone marrow purged of neuroblastoma cells or to receive three cycles of intensive chemotherapy alone. All patients who completed cytotoxic therapy without disease progression were then randomly assigned to receive no further therapy or treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid for six months. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SE) event-free survival rate three years after the first randomization was significantly better among the 189 patients who were assigned to undergo transplantation than among the 190 patients assigned to receive continuation chemotherapy (34+/-4 percent vs. 22+/-4 percent, P=0.034). The event-free survival rate three years after the second randomization was significantly better among the 130 patients who were assigned to receive 13-cis-retinoic acid than among the 128 patients assigned to receive no further therapy (46+/-6 percent vs. 29+/-5 percent, P=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with myeloablative therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation improved event-free survival among children with high-risk neuroblastoma. In addition, treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid was beneficial for patients without progressive disease when it was administered after chemotherapy or transplantation.

10704054|t|Inflammatory markers in cystic fibrosis patients with lung Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
10704054|a|Chronic endobronchial inflammation and bacterial infection are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with improper function of chloride channels. Inflammation in CF lung is greatly amplified after Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In this study the relationship between P. aeruginosa status and inflammatory markers has been investigated. Seventeen CF children in acute lung exacerbation were examined. CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection were characterized by elevated activity of sputum elastase, reduced response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to PHA and significant resistance to the antiproliferative action of glucocorticoids. These parameters were normalized after antibiotic treatment. The patients with prolonged P. aeruginosa infection demonstrated extremely high levels of elastase activity and elevated amounts of sputum IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Although antibiotic treatment resulted in clinical improvement, it failed to suppress excessive immune response in the lung. The data indicate that CF patients with prolonged P. aeruginosa need the modified treatment, which should include immunomodulating drugs and protease inhibitors as well as antibacterial therapy.

12766114|t|Identification and management of diabetic nephropathy in the diabetes clinic.
12766114|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and management of diabetic nephropathy in a diabetes clinic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Characteristics of nephropaths identified by existing screening practice (phase I, albuminuria >20 mg/l in three separate urine samples), were compared with those identified by a nurse-led management program (phase II, in which screening for nephropathy was based on albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a single random urine specimen). RESULTS: In phase I, 644 patients attended a diabetes clinic over a 6-month period. Microalbuminuria results were available for 485 patients (75%). A total of 115 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 17.8%). Of these patients, 91% had type 2 diabetes. During phase II, prospective analysis of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was carried out in 880 patients over 8 months. A total of 174 patients were identified as nephropaths (prevalence 20%). Of these, 134 patients had been identified by existing screening protocols. Forty had no previous record of microalbuminuria and were therefore newly identified by prospective screening. Systolic blood pressure guidelines were met in only 31% of all known nephropaths and 26.5% of newly diagnosed nephropaths. Diastolic blood pressure guidelines were met in 36% of all known and 38% of newly diagnosed nephropaths. In the patient group of known nephropaths from phases I and II, 62% were prescribed ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor (AIIR) antagonists. In the newly identified nephropathy patient cohort from phase II, 48% used ACEIs or AIIR antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of a nurse-led management program significantly improved detection of nephropathy. We are currently evaluating its impact on clinical management.

18579519|t|Dynein light chain LC8 negatively regulates NF-kappaB through the redox-dependent interaction with IkappaBalpha.
18579519|a|Redox regulation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been described, but the molecular mechanism underlying such regulation has remained unclear. We recently showed that a novel disulfide reductase, TRP14, inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation, and we identified the dynein light chain LC8, which interacts with the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha, as a potential substrate of TRP14. We now show the molecular mechanism by which NF-kappaB activation is redox-dependently regulated through LC8. LC8 inhibited TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in HeLa cells by interacting with IkappaBalpha and thereby preventing its phosphorylation by IkappaB kinase (IKK), without affecting the activity of IKK itself. TNFalpha induced the production of reactive oxygen species, which oxidized LC8 to a homodimer linked by the reversible formation of a disulfide bond between the Cys(2) residues of each subunit and thereby resulted in its dissociation from IkappaBalpha. Butylated hydroxyanisol, an antioxidant, and diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, attenuated the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha by TNFalpha stimulation. In addition LC8 inhibited NF-kappaB activation by other stimuli including interleukin-1beta and lipopolysaccharide, both of which generated reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, TRP14 catalyzed reduction of oxidized LC8. Together, our results indicate that LC8 binds IkappaBalpha in a redox-dependent manner and thereby prevents its phosphorylation by IKK. TRP14 contributes to this inhibitory activity by maintaining LC8 in a reduced state.

21718951|t|Radiochemotherapy of hepatocarcinoma via lentivirus-mediated transfer of human sodium iodide symporter gene and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene.
21718951|a|Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene/ganciclovir (GCV) system has been widely used as a traditional gene therapy modality, and the sodium/iodide symporter gene (NIS) has been found to be a novel therapeutic gene. Since the therapeutic effects of radioiodine therapy or prodrug chemotherapy on cancers following NIS or HSV-TK gene transfer need to be enhanced, this study was designed to investigate the feasibility of radiochemotherapy for hepatocarcinoma via coexpression of NIS gene and HSV-TK gene. METHODS: HepG2 cells were stably transfected with NIS, TK and GFP gene via recombinant lentiviral vector and named HepG2/NTG. Gene expression was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence imaging and iodide uptake. The therapeutic effects were assessed by MTT assay and clonogenic assay. RESULTS: HepG2/NTG cells concentrated (125)I(-) up to 76-fold higher than the wild-type cells within 20 min, and the efflux happened with a T(1/2eff) of less than 10 min. The iodide uptake in HepG2/NTG cells was specifically inhibited by sodium perchlorate. Dose-dependent toxicity to HepG2/NTG cells by either GCV or (131)I was revealed by clonogenic assay and MTT assay, respectively. The survival rate of HepG2/NTG cells decreased to 49.7% ±2.5%, 43.4% ±2.8% and 8.6% ±1.2% after exposure to (131)I, GCV and combined therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that radiochemotherapy of hepatocarcinoma via lentiviral-mediated coexpression of NIS gene and HSV-TK gene leads to stronger killing effect than single treatment, and in vivo studies are needed to verify these findings.

10826382|t|The relationship between heavy alcohol use and work productivity loss in active duty military personnel: a secondary analysis of the 1995 Department of Defense Worldwide Survey.
10826382|a|This cross-sectional study examines the association between heavy alcohol use among active duty military personnel and five work productivity loss events that may have an adverse effect on military performance and readiness. Data for light (N = 3,147) and heavy (N = 2,242) drinkers, categorized by gender and pay grade, were obtained from the 1995 Department of Defense Worldwide Survey. Drinking classification was predefined using a standard algorithm that factored quantity and frequency of wine, beer, and liquor consumed. The relative risks of experiencing a productivity loss event at a particular level and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by applying the Mantel-Haenszel method after adjusting for age. The relative risks for increased self-reported lateness, leaving early, low performance, and on-the-job injury were all higher for heavy drinkers than for light drinkers. This association between the heavy-drinking population and four of five work productivity loss events indicates that prevention programs should target all personnel.

8780414|t|Antidepressant treatment during breast-feeding.
8780414|a|OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this article is to review critically the literature about use of antidepressants during lactation. Strategies for the clinical management of depressed breast-feeding mothers are also suggested. METHOD: The authors conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE for articles. The review includes studies in which serum levels of drugs were obtained from nursing infants. RESULTS: Fifteen published reports were located that provided information for the following nine antidepressants: amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine, doxepin, dothiepin, fluoxetine, sertraline, and bupropion. CONCLUSIONS: Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine, dothiepin, and sertraline were not found in quantifiable amounts in nurslings, and no adverse effects were reported. Therefore, these are the drugs of choice for breast-feeding women. Adverse effects were described in some young infants whose mothers had been treated with doxepin or fluoxetine during breast-feeding. The collective serum level data suggest that infants older than 10 weeks are at low risk for adverse effects of tricyclics, and there is no evidence of accumulation. Research needs include an expanded database of mother-baby serum levels, behavioral assessments of infants during nursing, and longitudinal developmental evaluation of nurslings. Prescription of an antidepressant for a breast-feeding woman is a case-specific risk-benefit decision.

9563139|t|Comparison of LH-RH analogue 1-month depot and 3-month depot by their hormone levels and pharmacokinetic profile in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
9563139|a|In an open, randomized phase II pharmacokinetic study conducted in Germany and Italy, a total of 42 patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) were treated for 9 months with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LH-RH-a) leuprorelin acetate depot in two different formulations. Fifteen patients received the 1-month depot and 27 patients received the newly developed 3-month depot, containing 3.75 mg and 11.25 mg, respectively. In both groups, subcutaneous injections of leuprorelin acetate injected monthly or at 3-month intervals produced a complete down-regulation of the pituitary and led to persistent suppression of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone to the castrate range (< or = 50 ng/dl for testosterone) within the first month of treatment, which thereafter could be maintained over the entire observation period of 9 months. In 10 patients, pretreatment with an antiandrogen for the prevention of clinical flare-up resulted in a slightly more profound and earlier drop in serum testosterone. The 3-month depot showed a higher median peak serum concentration (Cmax) of leuprorelin at 20.8 ng/ml than the 1-month depot at 10.7 ng/ml but, conversely, this did not influence the rise in serum testosterone levels. Cmax occurred at 3 h for the 3-month and at 1 h for the 1-month depot formulation. During the steady state, constant release could be detected, starting on day 3 and day 7 for the 1-month and 3-month depot, respectively. A marked decrease in median prostate-specific antigen levels of 97.8% (1-month depot) and 96.6% (3-month depot) compared with baseline was observed, indicating an objective clinical response for more than 80% of all patients in both arms. Based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, the best response in terms of complete/partial remissions and stabilization was comparable in the two arms at 86.7% (1-month depot) and 85.2% (3-month depot). 6.7% in the 1-month group and 3% in the 3-month depot group showed progression of the disease. The most common side effects in both treatment groups were related to hormone deprivation. Both formulations of the potent LH-RH-a leuprorelin acetate were highly effective in the treatment of advanced PCa and led to comparable endocrine and clinical effects.

10714731|t|Monitoring osteoporosis therapy with bone densitometry: misleading changes and regression to the mean. Fracture Intervention Trial Research Group.
10714731|a|CONTEXT: The principle of "regression to the mean" predicts that patients with unusual responses to treatment might represent outliers who are likely to have more typical responses if treatment is continued without change. OBJECTIVE: To test whether women who lose bone mineral density (BMD) during the first year of treatment for osteoporosis continue to lose BMD if the same treatment is continued beyond 1 year. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 11 US clinical research centers for the Fracture Intervention Trial and 180 centers in the United States and other countries for the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation Trial. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Postmenopausal women with low BMD assigned to treatment with 5 mg/d of alendronate sodium in the Fracture intervention Trial who completed 2 years of BMD monitoring and adhered to study medication (n = 2634), and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis assigned to treatment with 60 or 120 mg/d of raloxifene hydrochloride in the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation trial who similarly completed 2 years of monitoring while adhering to study medication (n = 3954). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline, 12-, and 24-month hip and spine BMD. RESULTS: Women with the greatest loss of BMD during the first year of treatment were the most likely to gain BMD during continued treatment. Specifically, among women taking alendronate whose hip BMD decreased by more than 4% during the first year, 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82%-84%)had increases in hip BMD during the second year, with an overall mean increase of 4.7%. In contrast, those who seemed to gain at least 8% during the first year lost an average of 1% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.9%) during the next year. Similar results were observed among women taking raloxifene for 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that most women who lose BMD during the first year of treatment with alendronate or raloxifene will gain BMD if the same treatment is continued for a second year. These results illustrate the principle of regression to the mean and suggest that effective treatments for osteoporosis should not be changed because of loss of BMD during the first year of use.

22228673|t|Prescriptive contraceptive use among isotretinoin users in the Netherlands in comparison with non-users: a drug utilisation study.
22228673|a|PURPOSE: To assess the compliance with the isotretinoin Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) by evaluating the use of prescribed contraceptives among isotretinoin users. The PPP contains a requirement for the use of contraceptive methods for women of childbearing potential. METHODS: A drug utilisation study was performed using data from a drug prescription database (containing Dutch community pharmacy data) covering a population of 500   000 patients. Contraceptive use in female isotretinoin users and in a reference group of female non-isotretinoin users (aged 15-49   years) was compared using data from 1999 until 2006 in 2-year periods. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of the female isotretinoin users (n   =   651), 52%-54% filled prescriptions on contraceptives in strict accordance to the PPP, used before, during, and after discontinuation of isotretinoin, compared with 39%-46% in the reference group. A more liberal approach of a minimum of one prescription for a contraceptive method showed 61%-64% use of contraceptives among isotretinoin users. Similar patterns were seen when data were broken down in age groups. Furthermore, a higher proportion of female patients using isotretinoin prescribed by general practitioners used prescribed contraceptives compared with those receiving isotretinoin by specialists. CONCLUSION: Compliance with the contraceptive use according to a PPP for a teratogenic drug such as isotretinoin is 52%-64%, which is lower than anticipated. Reasons for the low compliance will need to be clarified before further measures can be taken.

11336083|t|Effects on urinary albumin excretion and renal function changes by delapril and manidipine in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.
11336083|a|This study was designed to investigate the effect of delapril, an ACE inhibitor, and manidipine, a long action calcium antagonist, on persistent microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients were randomized to take delapril 30 mg/day or manidipine 10 mg/day for 48 weeks, in an open label design. Twenty eight of thirty subjects in the delapril group and twenty nine of thirty in the manidipine group completed the study. Urine albumin excretion as measured by the urinary albumin creatinine ratio decreased significantly in both groups (112.0+/-60.9 to 95.3+/-64.9 mg/g and 108.5+/-51.0 to 96.4+/-53.5 mg/g in the delapril and manidipine group respectively, p < 0.05, by paired t-test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly changed after treatment in the delapril group but significantly decreased in the manidipine group (130.9+/-7.1/80.2+/-6.1 to 127.2+/-7.1/78.0+/-5.3 mm/Hg, p < 0.05, by student's paired t-test). After 48 weeks of treatment, two patients in the delapril group and one patient in the manidipine group converted to normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) and one patient in each group progressed to overt nephropathy (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g). There were no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum fructosamine, creatinine, potassium and lipid profiles after 48 weeks of treatment in both groups. Two cases in the delapril group were withdrawn during the study because of an intolerable cough and one case in the manidipine group because of intolerable dizziness and headache. In conclusion, both delapril and manidipine are effective in the reduction of microalbuminuria in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria.

16818700|t|Clinical and pharmacokinetic study of clofarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: strategy for treatment.
16818700|a|PURPOSE: Based on its mechanistic similarity to fludarabine and cladribine and the success of these analogues for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we hypothesized that clofarabine would be effective for indolent leukemias. The present study was conducted to determine the efficacy and cellular pharmacology during clinical trials of single-agent clofarabine in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Previously treated patients with relapsed/refractory CLL were eligible for this study. Clofarabine was infused over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Most patients received 3 or 4 mg/m2/d x 5 days, whereas the other two were treated with 15 mg/m2/d x 5 days. Clinical outcome and associated pharmacologic end points were assessed. RESULTS: Myelosuppression limited the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine to 3 mg/m2/d on this schedule. Cellular pharmacokinetic studies showed a median clofarabine triphosphate concentration in CLL lymphocytes of 1.5 micromol/L (range, 0.2-2.3 micromol/L; n = 9). In the majority of cases, >50% of the analogue triphosphate was present 24 hours after infusion, indicating prolonged retention of the triphosphate in CLL cells. Although cytoreduction was observed, no patients achieved a response. In vitro clofarabine incubation of leukemic lymphocytes from 29 CLL patients showed that clofarabine monophosphate accumulated to a higher concentration compared with the triphosphate. Nonetheless, the triphosphate increased in a dose-dependent fashion and upon successive clofarabine infusions, suggesting benefit from greater doses given at less frequent intervals. CONCLUSION: Levels of clofarabine triphosphate at higher doses and prolonged maintenance of clofarabine triphosphate in leukemic lymphocytes provide a rationale to treat CLL in a weekly clofarabine schedule.

9727819|t|Variation in the mineral content of commercially available bottled waters: implications for health and disease.
9727819|a|PURPOSE: Although the annual consumption of bottled water in North America is 12.7 gallons per capita, little is known about the potential health effects of these waters. We reviewed the amounts of major minerals found in commercially available bottled waters, the recommended daily allowances for these minerals, and their beneficial and harmful effects. METHODS: We obtained the mineral content of various commercially available bottled waters in North America and Europe from The Pocket Guide to Bottled Water. We then conducted a Medline search to identify articles examining the beneficial and harmful effects of magnesium, sodium, and calcium. RESULTS: Great variation exists in the mineral content of commercially available bottled waters. Among the bottled waters that we reviewed, the magnesium content ranges from 0 to 126 mg per liter, the sodium content ranges from 0 to 1,200 mg per liter, and the calcium content ranges from 0 to 546 mg per liter. Epidemiologic and clinical studies suggest that magnesium may reduce the frequency of sudden death, that sodium contributes to the occurrence of hypertension, and that calcium may help prevent osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: The ideal bottled water should be rich in magnesium and calcium and have a low sodium content. Because there is great variation in the mineral content of commercially available bottled waters, the actual mineral content of bottled water should be considered when selecting one for consumption.

20849433|t|Clinical and microbiological effects of mechanical instrumentation and local antimicrobials during periodontal supportive therapy in aggressive periodontitis patients: smoker versus non-smoker patients.
20849433|a|AIM: To compare the clinical and microbiological effects of ultrasonic mechanical instrumentation (UMI) associated to home-care use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF(2) )-containing mouthrinse and toothpaste in smoker and non-smoker patients affected by generalized aggressive periodontitis (G-AgP) during a recall session of supportive periodontal therapy (SPT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen smokers and 25 non-smokers G-AgP patients enrolled in an SPT programme received a single session of UMI associated with home-care use of AmF/SnF(2) -containing mouthrinse and toothpaste. Clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed pre-treatment, at 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, UMI plus AmF/SnF(2) -implemented oral hygiene use determined a significant decrease of total bacterial counts, with non-smokers exhibiting a lower count compared with smokers at 12 weeks. No significant differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers in the counts of total pathogens and red complex species at each observation interval. Clinically, a significant reduction of supragingival plaque, gingival inflammation and probing pocket depth was similarly observed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A combined mechanical/chemical plaque control approach based on UMI and the use of AmF/SnF(2) agents resulted in the reduction of supragingival plaque deposits, gingival inflammation and subgingival periodontal pathogens in G-AgP patients during SPT, with no substantial difference between smokers and non-smokers.

19216943|t|Mechanisms of resistance and mobility among multidrug-resistant CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli from Canadian intensive care units: the 1st report of QepA in North America.
19216943|a|We studied the molecular mechanisms of resistance and mobility of 18 multidrug-resistant CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli isolates isolated from patients in Canadian intensive care units. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (83.3%) had mutations in gyrA and parC. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnr (A, B, and S), qepA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr were detected in 0%, 5.6%, and 44.4%, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates (61.1%) carried a dfr gene, and 10 (90.9%) of the 11 carried 1 or more sul genes. Gentamicin-resistant isolates (27.8%) carried the aac(3')-II gene, and doxycycline-resistant isolates (33.3%) carried 1 or more tet efflux genes. Both genetically related and unrelated groups of E. coli harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were observed. The bla(CTX-M) genes were primarily located on diverse IncF plasmids of multiple replicon types downstream of the ISEcp1 element. The spread of the bla(CTX-M) genes among E. coli in Canada occurs through a diversity of different mechanisms and does not correspond to a single CTX-M determinant, or a single clone, or a single plasmid but rather through the combination of clonal spread of virulent strains and acquisition of diverse CTX-M-bearing plasmids. We report the 1st qepA-producing E. coli in North America.

22187097|t|Stress-induced hyperglycaemia and venous thromboembolism following total hip or total knee arthroplasty: analysis from the RECORD trials.
22187097|a|Stress-induced hyperglycaemia is common during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, hyperglycaemia activates coagulation. The aim of the study was to assess whether stress-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) following orthopaedic surgery. We performed post-hoc analyses in the four RECORD studies (REgulation of Coagulation in major Orthopaedic surgery reducing the Risk of Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Separate analyses were performed for patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement. Outcome measures were symptomatic VTE and "total VTE" (defined as the composite of symptomatic VTE, asymptomatic DVT assessed by per protocol venography and all cause mortality). Glucose levels were measured pre-op and 6 hours post-op, categorised into quartiles, based on the distribution in the respective cohorts. The influence of glucose, adjusted for body mass index, age, gender and diabetes mellitus on VTE was assessed by logistic regression analyses. A total of 12,383 patients were eligible for assessment of symptomatic VTE, and 8,512 patients were eligible for assessment of total VTE. Increased glucose levels after total hip replacement were associated with total VTE; adjusted odds ratio (OR) highest versus lowest quartile 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 3.0). Furthermore, increase in glucose levels during total hip replacement was associated with total VTE (OR highest versus lowest quartile 1.8 (95%CI 1.2 to 2.8). This was not observed in patients undergoing total knee replacement, probably due to differences in the applied surgical procedures.

17425956|t|Anti-fibrillogenic and fibril-destabilizing activity of nicotine in vitro: implications for the prevention and therapeutics of Lewy body diseases.
17425956|a|The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been implicated as a critical step in the development of Lewy body diseases (LBD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Both retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between cigarette smoking and Parkinson's disease (PD). We used fluorescence spectroscopy with thioflavin S, electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to examine the effects of nicotine, pyridine, and N-methylpyrrolidine on the formation of alphaS fibrils (f alphaS) from wild-type alphaS (alphaS (WT)) and A53T mutant alphaS (A53T) and on preformed f alpha Ss. Nicotine dose-dependently inhibited the f alphaS formation from both alphaS (WT) and A53T. Moreover, nicotine dose-dependently destabilized preformed f alpha Ss. These effects of nicotine were similar to those of N-methylpyrrolidine. The anti-fibrillogenic activity of nicotine may be exerted not only by the inhibition of f alphaS formation but also by the destabilization of preformed f alphaS. Additionally, this effect may be attributed to N-methylpyrrolidine moieties of nicotine.

1330898|t|The comparative role of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and phorbol esters in the differentiation of the U937 cell line.
1330898|a|The active metabolite of cholecalciferol, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-DHCC), is a mononuclear phagocyte product with immunoregulatory properties which can influence not only surrounding T cells but also other mononuclear phagocytes; and which acts in an autocrine fashion. In this study we have used the U937 cell line as a starting point model to investigate further the comparative role of 1,25-DHCC and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) upon growth, differentiation and phenotype in the mononuclear phagocyte system, and have correlated our findings with changes in 1,25-DHCC metabolism and receptor expression. Both 1,25-DHCC and PMA inhibit growth and differentiate U937 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. When used together, however, at low doses of PMA, 1,25-DHCC protects against the PMA-induced growth inhibition. At high concentrations of both compounds there is a decrease (1,25-DHCC) or an increase (PMA) in 1,25-DHCC receptor expression, with either 24-OHase (1,25-DHCC) or 1-OHase (PMA) synthesis. If the compounds are used in combination the receptor levels are equivalent to controls, and both enzymes are produced. The phenotype of the 1,25-DHCC-induced cells shows light adherence, class I+, increase in CD4 and CD14 and decrease in CD71. The PMA-induced cell is tightly adherent, class I+, and strongly positive for CD13 with a concomitant decrease in both CD4 and CD71. These findings suggest another role for 1,25-DHCC in the mononuclear phagocyte system, as a potential mitogenic agent. They also suggest that 1,25-DHCC may act at both membrane and nuclear levels within this model of the mononuclear phagocyte pathway and demonstrate one possible way in which physiological peripheral macrophage heterogeneity might be induced, i.e. due to the nature of the signals which are implicated during differentiation. The presence of increased CD4 and decreased CD13 on the surface of 1,25-DHCC-differentiated cells, and vice versa on PMA-differentiated cells, illustrates how this may then be reflected in functional mononuclear phagocyte heterogeneity, which may in turn be reflected in differential peripheral function.

21284489|t|Attenuation of oxidative stress by allylpyrocatechol in synovial cellular infiltrate of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
21284489|a|Free radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by unchecked synovial inflammation. Allylpyrocatechol, a phytoconstituent of Piper betle leaves, has potent anti-inflammatory activity and this study evaluated its anti-oxidant effect on the synovial infiltrate of patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. The ex vivo effect of allylpyrocatechol upon generation of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes was measured by flow cytometry using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, wherein it significantly decreased basal levels as also scavenged phorbol myristate acetate generated reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, its effect on generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals produced within infiltrated neutrophils was measured by cytochrome c and deoxyribose assay, respectively. Allylpyrocatechol significantly scavenged superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in infiltrated neutrophils. The effect of allylpyrocatechol on nitric oxide was measured in macrophages using 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate by flow cytometry wherein it decreased production of nitric oxide in infiltrated macrophages, which correlated with its in vitro nitric oxide scavenging activity. Taken together, this ex vivo study has established that allylpyrocatechol has potent scavenging activity and could be considered as an add-on therapy in the treatment of inflammation-associated disorders like Rheumatoid Arthritis.

17532164|t|Silicone mammary implants--can we turn back the time?
17532164|a|Mankind remains infatuated with finding the "fountain of youth'', and plastic surgery has become a very important component in the search for eternal youth. Invasive procedures such as face-lifts, body contouring, and implantation of silicone mammary implants (SMI) as well as less invasive procedures such as wrinkle decreasing protocols using filler substances or botulinum toxin, effectively reshape and rejuvenate the aging face or body. However, despite the improved cosmetic appearance of the individual, these treatments disrupt normal aging processes on cellular and molecular level. For example, silicone degradation products promote protein denaturation and activate cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system, thus perpetuating a chronic pro-inflammatory response of the local tissue. In this review, we concentrate on SMI and summarize the current clinical approaches, and the immunological and biochemical effects of those interventions.

18826942|a|Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is a bifunctional enzyme with peroxidase activity and Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activity. Here, we report that H2O2-induced cellular toxicity acts through Prdx6 hyperoxidation. Under high concentrations of H2O2 (> 100 microm), Prdx6, and 2-Cys Prdxs were hyperoxidized. Contrary to hyperoxidation of 2-Cys Prdxs, hyperoxidation of Prdx6 was irreversible in vivo. Surprisingly, H2O2-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition correlated with hyperoxidation and increased iPLA2 activity of Prdx6. This arrest was also associated with up-regulation of p53 and p21 and with down-regulation of cyclin B1. Furthermore, the H2O2-mediated increase in iPLA2 activity was dramatically abolished in a hyperoxidation mutant (C47A), an iPLA2 mutant (S32A), and a double mutant (C47A/S32A) of Prdx6, demonstrating the essential requirement of Prdx6 C47 hyperoxidation for its iPLA2 activity. Together, our results demonstrate that H2O2-mediated hyperoxidation of Prdx6 induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition through up-regulation of iPLA2 activity.

11709805|t|Aldosterone in progressive renal disease.
11709805|a|Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has proven effective in retarding progression of renal disease in the remnant kidney model, as well as other experimental diseases, and, most importantly, in a range of progressive human renal diseases. Attention has focused on the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in propagating progression both by its hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic actions. Recent evidence, predominately in the remnant kidney model, indicates that the drugs used to block this hormone system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, also lower aldosterone levels. Thus, aldosterone, as well as angiotensin II, appears to be instrumental in sustaining the hypertension and fibroproliferative destruction of the residual kidney.

19709082|t|High incidence of haemophagocytic syndrome following umbilical cord blood transplantation for adults.
19709082|a|Umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) is widely accepted, but one critical issue for adult patients is a low engraftment rate, of which one cause is haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). We aimed to identify the contribution of HPS to engraftment failure after CBT, following preparative regimens containing fludarabine phosphate, in 119 patients (median age, 55 years; range; 17-69 years) with haematological diseases. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprised continuous infusion of a calcineurin inhibitor with or without mycophenolate mofetil. Of the 119 patients, 20 developed HPS within a median of 15 d (cumulative incidence; 16.8%) and 17 of them did so before engraftment. Donor-dominant chimaerism was confirmed in 16 of 18 evaluable patients with HPS. Despite aggressive interventions including corticosteroid, ciclosporin, high-dose immunoglobulin and/or etoposide, engraftment failed in 14 of 18 patients. Of these 14 patients, four received second rescue transplantation and all resulted in successful engraftment. Overall survival rates significantly differed between patients with and without HPS (15.0% vs. 35.4%; P < 0.01). Univariate and multivariate analysis identified having fewer infused CD34(+) cells as a significant risk factor for the development of HPS (P = 0.01 and 0.006, respectively). We concluded that engraftment failure closely correlated with HPS in our cohort, which negatively impacted overall survival after CBT.

1564958|t|Induction of intracellular and plasma 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase by pentostatin.
1564958|a|Similar to interferon alpha, pentostatin is highly effective in hairy cell leukemia and moderately active in other chronic lymphoid malignancies. In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity.

17976883|t|Environment, diet and CpG island methylation: epigenetic signals in gastrointestinal neoplasia.
17976883|a|The epithelial surfaces of the mammalian alimentary tract are characterised by very high rates of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, and in humans they are highly susceptible to cancer. The role of somatic mutations as drivers of carcinogenesis in the alimentary tract is well established, but the importance of gene silencing by epigenetic mechanisms is increasingly recognised. Methylation of CpG islands is an important component of the epigenetic code that regulates gene expression during development and normal cellular differentiation, and a number of genes are well known to become abnormally methylated during the development of tumours of the oesophagus, stomach and colorectum. Aberrant patterns of DNA methylation develop as a result of pathological processes such as chronic inflammation, and in response to various dietary factors, including imbalances in the supply of methyl donors, particularly folates, and exposure to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which include polyphenols and possibly isothiocyanates from plant foods. However the importance of these environmental interactions in human health and disease remains to be established. Recent moves to modify the exposure of human populations to folate, by mandatory supplementation of cereal foods, emphasise the importance of understanding the susceptibility of the human epigenome to dietary and other environmental effects.

16086620|t|An open study of triiodothyronine augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.
16086620|a|OBJECTIVE: In an open trial, we investigated the efficacy of triiodothyronine (T(3)) adjuvant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) resistant to SSRI treatment. METHOD: Twenty subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for MDD (mean +/- SD age = 44.3 +/- 10.3 years; 55% [N = 11] women) and had failed to respond to a course of treatment of at least 8 weeks with an SSRI antidepressant were enrolled in a 4-week open-label augmentation treatment with T(3) 50 microg/day. Atypical and melancholic sub-types of MDD were diagnosed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders criteria. We administered the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) 4 times during the study (which was conducted between 2001 and 2003). RESULTS: During T(3) augmentation, the severity of depression decreased from an initial mean +/- SD HAM-D-17 score of 20.5 +/- 3.6 to a final HAM-D-17 score of 14.0 +/- 7.1 (p < .001). Seven subjects (35.0%) were treatment responders (HAM-D-17 reduction >or= 50%), and 6 subjects (30.0%) achieved clinical remission (final HAM-D-17 <or= 7). The 5 subjects with atypical depression experienced significantly (p < .01) greater clinical improvement (final HAM-D-17 scores 6.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 16.4 +/- 4.5), and higher rates of treatment response (100% [5/5] vs. 13.3% [2/15]) and remission (80.0% [4/5] vs. 13.3% [2/15]), compared to subjects with nonatypical MDD. The 8 subjects with melancholic MDD experienced significantly (p < .05) greater depression severity at the end of the study compared to nonmelancholic MDD subjects (final HAM-D-17 scores = 18.3 +/- 6.6 vs. 11.1 +/- 6.1). CONCLUSION: Triiodothyronine augmentation of SSRIs may be a promising treatment strategy in SSRI-resistant MDD, particularly in subjects with the atypical MDD subtype.

15662234|t|Controlled-release nifedipine and candesartan low-dose combination therapy in patients with essential hypertension: the NICE Combi (Nifedipine and Candesartan Combination) Study.
15662234|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of low-dose controlled-release (CR) nifedipine (20 mg/day) plus candesartan (8 mg/day) combination therapy with that of up-titrated candesartan (12 mg/day) monotherapy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: Outpatient study. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with essential hypertension, who did not achieve their target blood pressure with baseline treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure, pulse pressure, urinary microalbumin excretion. RESULTS: Blood pressure was significantly reduced in both groups (P < 0.05), but the reduction was significantly greater in the combination therapy group (12.1 +/- 1.4/8.7 +/- 0.9 mmHg) than in the up-titrated monotherapy group (4.1 +/- 1.4/4.6 +/- 0.9 mmHg) (P < 0.0001). The reduction in pulse pressure was significantly greater in the combination therapy group (3.3 +/- 1.2 mmHg) than in the up-titrated monotherapy group (0.7 +/- 1.2 mmHg) (P = 0.0031). Urinary microalbumin excretion decreased significantly in the combination therapy group (from 61.9 to 40.5 mg/g creatinine; P < 0.05), but not in the up-titrated monotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the low-dose combination therapy of nifedipine CR and candesartan is superior to the up-titrated monotherapy of candesartan in terms of blood pressure control and renal protection in patients with essential hypertension.

23835714|t|Taxane-cisplatin-fluorouracil as induction chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancers: an individual patient data meta-analysis of the meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck cancer group.
23835714|a|PURPOSE Cisplatin plus fluorouracil (PF) induction chemotherapy has been compared with taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), cisplatin, and fluorouracil (Tax-PF) in randomized trials in locoregionally advanced head and neck cancers (LAHNCs). The aim of this meta-analysis was to study the efficacy and toxicity of Tax-PF and PF and identify differences in outcomes in subsets of patients. METHODS Five randomized trials representing 1,772 patients were identified. Updated individual patient data (IPD) were retrieved for all trials. The log-rank test, stratified by trial, was used for comparison. Interaction or trend tests were used to study the interaction between covariates and treatment. Results Median follow-up was 4.9 years. The hazard ratio (HR) of death was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89; P < .001; absolute benefit at 5 years: 7.4%) in favor of Tax-PF. Heterogeneity was significant (P = .08, I(2) = 51%) and related to one trial. There was no more heterogeneity after exclusion of this trial (P = .99, I(2) = 0%), and HR of death was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83) in favor of Tax-PF. There was no interaction between treatment effect and the following patient covariates: age, sex, performance status, tumor stage, or site. Tax-PF was associated with significant reductions of progression, locoregional failure, and distant failure compared with PF, with HRs of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.87; P < .001), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.94; P = .007), and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.89; P = .009) respectively. CONCLUSION This IPD meta-analysis shows the superiority of Tax-PF over PF as induction chemotherapy. Its precise role in the management of LAHNC remains to be determined.

11075841|t|Natural history of migraine in childhood.
11075841|a|Epidemiological studies have shown that 3-7% of the paediatric population suffer from migraine. Despite this high prevalence little has been published about the natural history of migraine or of its prognosis. The objectives of this study were: (i) to outline the natural history of migraine in childhood; and (ii) to identify early predictors of an unfavourable clinical evolution. A prospective, longitudinal, 10-year follow-up study was conducted of the clinical evolution of 181 paediatric patients with migraine. Data analysis was performed by statistical significance and logistic regression tests. In our study 24.3% of children with migraine had their onset before age 6 years and another 57% between 6 and 10 years of age. A positive family history of migraine was recorded in 77.5%. Eighty-eight percent of patients followed a favourable clinical course. The remaining 12% of patients had to be placed on prophylactic treatment owing to the increasing of their headache. Of all parameters investigated, the age of onset was the only statistically significant predictor of an unfavourable clinical evolution. We conclude: (i) most patients with migraine headache starting in childhood do not require prophylactic treatment; (ii) the earlier the disease begins the more likely is an unfavourable clinical course; (iii) genetic factors play an important role in the phenotypic expression of the disease; (iv) our study suggests the existence, at least, of two different populations among childhood migraine patients.

15327647|t|In vitro activity of moxifloxacin compared to other antimicrobials against streptococci isolated from iatrogenic oral bacteremia in Spain.
15327647|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Systemic dissemination of oral bacteria to distant body sites may be the cause of focal infections. The unsuitable use and overexposure to antimicrobial therapy in clinical dental practice may contribute to the worldwide problem of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibilities of streptococci isolated from the bloodstream after dental extractions against penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and a new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients who required dental extractions were studied. Venous blood samples were collected from each patient at baseline (before dental manipulation) and 30 s after dental extractions. The samples were processed in the Bactec 9240. The isolated bacteria were identified by conventional microbiological techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 81 streptococci was determined by the E-test method. The NCCLS performance standards were followed. RESULTS: 88.9-92.5% of the streptococci were sensitive to beta-lactam agents tested with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90s) ranging from 0.094 to 0.19 mg/l. The resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was 40.8% (MIC(90HR) = 256 mg/l) and 21% (MIC(90HR) = 256 mg/l), respectively. The MIC(90) to moxifloxacin was 0.125 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Most of the streptococci isolated from the bloodstream after dental extractions were susceptible in vitro to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin. The high percentage of streptococci resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin could restrict their usefulness as prophylactic drugs. All the isolates showed a low MIC of moxifloxacin in vitro, making it a promising antimicrobial alternative for the prevention of streptococcal focal infections associated with certain dental manipulations, when the administration of beta-lactam agents is not indicated.

9337997|t|Proteolytic fragments of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3: N-terminal sequences and relationships between structure and biological activity.
9337997|a|Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) in biological fluids bind to high-affinity binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), which transport them and regulate their activities. Limited proteolysis of certain IGFBPs plays a major role in this regulation. IGFBP-3 is proteolysed in vivo and in several cell lines by serine proteases, including plasmin. In earlier studies we reproduced this proteolysis in vitro using recombinant human non-glycosylated IGFBP-3. Two major fragments were obtained, the larger retaining weak affinity for IGF-I and weakly inhibiting IGF I mitogenic effects. The smaller fragment, though lacking affinity for IGFs, is a potent growth inhibitor. These proteolytic fragments were isolated by HPLC and their N-terminal amino acids sequenced. Both major fragments contain the N-terminal region of the intact protein, the larger form corresponding to residues 1-160, and the smaller form, to residues 1-95. Kinetics experiments using the MG-63 osteoblast-like cell line showed that the larger peptide is generated before the smaller peptide, the latter probably being a product of secondary proteolysis of the former. Our data suggest that proteolysis of IGFBP-3 is intimately linked to its biological function. We propose a model for its action at cellular level.

16024758|t|The case for progesterone.
16024758|a|Recent clinical trials in hormone therapy (HT) for women approaching or past menopause have been disappointing. Most women who have been taking conjugated equine estrogens combined with synthetic progestins have been encouraged to stop these supplements because of increased health risks. The results of the clinical trials may be accurate about the risks associated with the synthetic compounds and combinations, but the data do not reflect what might have been the case if 17beta-estradiol had been tested with natural progesterone instead of synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate. For the most part, in almost all work on HT, estrogens have been given the primary focus despite the fact that progesterone has important properties that can enhance the repair of neurodegenerative and traumatic injuries to the central nervous system. This article reviews some of those properties and discusses the evidence suggesting that, if HT is to be reconsidered, progesterone should be given more attention as a potent neurotrophic agent that may play an important role in reducing or preventing motor, cognitive, and sensory impairments that can accompany senescence in both males and females.

The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at months 4, 5, and 6 of treatment was compared with the mean number of lesions noted on pretreatment brain MRI scans. Number and volume of Gd-enhancing lesions declined by 44%, (p<0.0001) and 41% (p=0.0018), respectively. Treatment was well tolerated. Oral simvastatin might inhibit inflammatory components of multiple sclerosis that lead to neurological disability.

8082301|t|Immune complex glomerulonephritis is induced in rats immunized with heterologous myeloperoxidase.
8082301|a|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), including anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, are associated with pauci-immune necrotizing small vessel vasculitis or glomerulonephritis. In order to substantiate a pathogenic role for ANCA, an animal model of pauci-immune ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis or vasculitis is required. Brouwer et al. reported pauci-immune glomerulonephritis in rats immunized with human MPO followed by perfusion of kidneys with lysosomal enzyme extract combined with H2O2, and suggested that this could serve as a model of ANCA-induced disease. We repeated these studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Brown Norway rats (BNR). We immunized rats with human MPO. When circulating anti-MPO antibodies were detectable by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISA, blood pressure was measured, then perfusion of the left kidney of each rat was done via the renal artery in a closed, blood-free circuit with either MPO + H2O2, MPO, H2O2 alone or MPO + H2O2 + neutral protease. Rats were killed on day 4 or day 10 after perfusion, and specimens were examined by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. Pathological lesions and deposits of IgG, C3, and MPO were found in immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 with or without neutral protease, or MPO alone, in both rat strains and on both day 4 and day 10. The degree of histologic injury was proportional in intensity to the amount of IgG immune deposits. Spontaneously hypertensive rats sustained more damage and higher blood pressure than Brown Norway rats. No lesion was observed in immunized rats perfused with H2O2 or in the non-perfused right kidneys. Some of the non-immunized rats perfused with MPO + H2O2 developed pathological lesions. In conclusion, these rat models are examples of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, and therefore are not similar to human ANCA-associated disease.

18971536|t|Beneficial effects of combination therapy with angiotensin II receptor blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on vascular endothelial function.
18971536|a|The combination of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be more effective than the individual drugs alone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine or the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on vascular endothelial function and arteriosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension who had already been receiving angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy. Thirty-two patients with essential hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy were randomized to receive 5 mg of amlodipine (n=16) or 4 mg of perindopril (n=16) once daily in the morning for 24 weeks. The patients were evaluated before and after therapy to assess changes in blood pressure, flow-mediated vasodilation (a parameter of vascular endothelial function), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (a parameter of arteriosclerosis). Before treatment, there were no significant differences in the above parameters between groups. After treatment, there was a similar significant decrease in blood pressure in both groups. Flow-mediated vasodilation increased significantly in the perindopril group compared with the amlodipine group; however, the decrease in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril is superior to the calcium channel blocker amlodipine for reducing vascular endothelial dysfunction when co-administered with angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with essential hypertension.

22020816|t|Spray-dried respirable powders containing bacteriophages for the treatment of pulmonary infections.
22020816|a|Myoviridae bacteriophages were processed into a dry powder inhalable dosage form using a low-temperature spray-drying process. The phages were incorporated into microparticles consisting of trehalose, leucine, and optionally a third excipient (either a surfactant or casein sodium salt). The particles were designed to have high dispersibility and a respirable particle size, and to preserve the phages during processing. Bacteriophages KS4- M, KS14, and cocktails of phages Î¦KZ/D3 and Î¦KZ/D3/KS4-M were spray-dried with a processing loss ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 log pfu. The aerosol performance of the resulting dry powders as delivered from an Aerolizer ® dry powder inhaler (DPI) exceeded the performance of commercially available DPIs; the emitted mass and the in vitro total lung mass of the lead formulation were 82.7% and 69.7% of filled capsule mass, respectively. The total lung mass had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.5-2.8  µm. The total in vitro lung doses of the phages, delivered from a single actuation of the inhaler, ranged from 10(7) to 10(8) pfu, levels that are expected to be efficacious in vivo. Spray drying of bacteriophages into a respirable dry powder was found to be feasible.

24758387|t|The role of interferon in the new era of hepatitis C treatments.
24758387|a|Interferon has been the backbone of HCV treatment since this agent was first introduced nearly two decades ago. Interferon acts to eradicate HCV via two mechanisms: by directly inhibiting HCV replication via an indirect anti-viral mechanism and by modulating an immune response against hepatocytes infected with HCV. The current treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 is the combination of peginterferon, ribavirin and a single direct acting anti-viral agent (DAA). Within the next 1-2 years multiple DAA combinations will eradicate and cure HCV at high rates without interferon. The role interferon will play in the next era of HCV treatment will depend upon balancing cost, efficacy and the development of an interferon with a more favorable adverse event profile.

1656784|t|Endothelin: localization, synthesis, activity, and receptor types in human penile corpus cavernosum.
1656784|a|The localization, synthesis, and activity of endothelin and the receptor types mediating its effects in penile corpus cavernosum were investigated in whole tissue and in cultured cells derived from this tissue. With immunocytochemistry, utilizing an antiendothelin 1 (ET-1) monoclonal antibody, endothelin-like immunoreactivity was localized intensely in the endothelium and to a lesser degree in the trabecular smooth muscle. Human corpus cavernosum endothelial cells in culture expressed preproendothelin 1 mRNA, as determined by Northern blot analysis. Significant amounts of endothelin-like immunoreactivity were measured by radioimmunoassay in the supernatants of corpus cavernosum endothelial cells in culture. Endothelins are potent constrictors and caused long-lasting contractions of corporeal strips in organ chambers. Equilibrium binding analysis of endothelins to their receptor sites revealed high-affinity, specific, and saturable binding of labeled endothelins to corporeal membranes. Competition binding experiments demonstrated receptors with high affinity for ET-1 and -2 and low affinity for ET-3 and another, less abundant, set of receptors with high affinity for ET-1, -2, and -3. Affinity labeling of endothelins to corporeal membranes, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, revealed that ET-1 and -2 cross-linked specifically to three different molecular mass components (75, 52, and 34 kDa). ET-3 bound only to the 34-kDa component. It is concluded that human corpus cavernosum endothelium has the ability to synthesize and release endothelin, that endothelins contract corporeal smooth muscle, and that at least two distinct endothelin receptors may exist and are differentiated by their affinity for ET-3.

1416828|t|Impact of bioavailability on determination of the maximal tolerated dose of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine in phase I trials.
1416828|a|The objective of this study was to determine the population pharmacokinetic parameters and the extent of absorption of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine, a nucleoside analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and in vivo, after oral and intravenous administration through the use of NON-linear Mixed Effects Modeling. The data were drawn from the pharmacokinetics section of an open-label, multicenter phase I study. One center administered ddI on a once-daily schedule. The other centers administered the drug once every 12 h. Drug was administered intravenously, and the plasma concentration-time profile was determined. Patients were then given the drug orally at twice the dose used in the intravenous portion of the study, and the pharmacokinetic profile was again determined. A 40-fold range of doses was examined. Forty-six human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were studied. Concentrations in plasma were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Clearance of the drug from plasma was 47.7 liters/h/70 kg of body weight. The terminal half-life was 1.4 h. The volume of distribution in the central compartment was 18.8 liters/70 kg. Absorption was rapid, with an absorption half-life of 0.52 h. Bioavailability with once-daily administration was 27%. For twice-daily administration, bioavailability rose to 36%. This difference was significant (P much less than 0.01). For doses of less than or equal to 5.1 mg/kg given every 12 h (10.2 mg/kg/day), bioavailability was 41%. We conclude that once-daily administration results in lower mean bioavailability, probably because of a saturation of the absorption process similar to that seen with acyclovir. This difference in bioavailability on the basis of the administration schedule explains the different short-term maximal tolerated doses identified in phase I trials of this agent.

22115592|t|A small molecule inhibitor of p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D.
22115592|a|PPM1D is a p53-inducible Ser/Thr protein phosphatase. PPM1D gene amplification and overexpression have been reported in a variety of human tumors, including breast cancer and neuroblastoma. Because the phosphatase activity of PPM1D is essential for its oncogenic role, PPM1D inhibitors should be viable anti-cancer agents. In our current study, we showed that SPI-001 was a potent and specific PPM1D inhibitor. SPI-001 inhibited PPM1D phosphatase activity in PPM1D-overexpressing human breast cancer cells and increased phosphorylation of p53. Furthermore, SPI-001 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Our present study suggested that SPI-001 was a potential lead compound in developing anti-cancer drugs.

19515084|t|Development and validation of a risk scoring model to predict net adverse cardiovascular outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients pretreated with 600 mg clopidogrel: rationale and design of the RISK-PCI study.
19515084|a|BACKGROUND: No comprehensive primary PCI (pPCI) risk model to predict net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE) has been reported with the use of clopidogrel 600 mg, which is now considered the standard loading dose. The primary hypothesis of the RISK-PCI trial is that an accurate risk prediction may be achieved by using clinical, angiographic, and procedural variables available at the time of intervention. METHODS: The present single-center, longitudinal, cohort study will include 1,750 consecutive patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), undergoing pPCI after pretreatment with 300 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel. The primary end-points of the trial (NACE) include major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major bleeding. A logistic regression model will be developed to predict 30-day and 1-year NACE after pPCI. A risk score derived from study set data will be validated using validation set data. RESULTS: Until June 1, 2008, 1,166 patients have been enrolled. Thirty-day follow-up is available in 1,007 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The RISK-PCI study is designed to develop an accurate risk scoring system, using variables available at the time of intervention, to predict long-term adverse outcomes after pPCI.

11304108|t|Rational use of new and existing disease-modifying agents in rheumatoid arthritis.
11304108|a|Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty.

18690658|t|Chemoprevention and inhibition of P-glycoprotein in cancer cells by Chinese medicinal herbs.
18690658|a|Many of the herbal extracts used in the Chinese clinical medical routine inhibit the growth of tumor cells. In the present work, extracts of 12 selected herbs were prepared with methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water, and the effects of these on the multidrug resistance (MDR) and P-glycoprotein of mouse lymphoma cells transfected with the human mdr1 gene and on a human lung alveolar epithelial cell line were investigated. The extracts were tested for antiproliferative effects, and the reversal of MDR in mouse lymphoma cells. The possible chemopreventive effect of the chloroform extracts was studied on the expression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early (IE) antigen in human lung cancer cells (A549). The antimicrobial effects of the extracts were tested on some representative micro-organisms. Certain of the chloroform extracts of the plant materials were the most effective compounds on the reversal of MDR. Two of the chloroform extracts enhanced the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin on MDR mouse lymphoma cells. The selected extracts did not show any antibacterial effect with the agar diffusion method. Certain chloroform extracts decreased the intermediate IE antigen expression of CMV in A459 cells.

12598926|t|Synaptic and molecular mechanisms of glutamatergic synapses in pain and memory.
12598926|a|Glutamate is a fast excitatory transmitter in mammalian brains. Glutamatergic synapses are found in central regions related to pain transmission, plasticity and modulation. Glutamate NMDA receptors in forebrain structures are well known to contribute to the formation and storage of information. Here we propose the hypothesis that forebrain NMDA receptors play an important role in persistent inflammatory pain by re-enforcing glutamate sensory transmission in the brain. Mice with enhanced function of forebrain NMDA receptors demonstrate selective enhancement of persistent pain and allodynia. Drugs targeting forebrain NMDA NR2B receptors may serve as a new class of medicine to control persistent pain in humans.

8292312|a|A set of research diagnostic criteria was developed to identify potential obsessive-compulsive disorders among individuals with mental retardation and aberrant behaviors. The behavior disorders of 10 subjects who met criteria for compulsive behavior disorder and 6 subjects who did not (comparison subjects) were treated using the medication fluoxetine. All subjects were evaluated using an A-B open-trial method with 4-month baseline and treatment phases. Seven of the 10 subjects with compulsive behavior disorder responded favorably to fluoxetine treatment; none of the comparison subjects responded favorably to this medication. Further, there appeared to be a relation between manifest motor stereotypies, compulsive behaviors, and response to fluoxetine.

9808050|t|Analysis of bax protein in sphingosine-induced apoptosis in the human leukemic cell line TF1 and its bcl-2 transfectants.
9808050|a|Sphingosine, a sphingolipid breakdown product, has been proposed as an apoptosis-inducing agent. In this study, we examined the effect of sphingosine in bcl-2-overexpressing cells compared with cells that do not express the bcl-2 gene. The human erythroleukemic cell line TF1, which lacks bcl-2 expression, was easily induced to undergo apoptotic cell death by a variety of stimuli, including depletion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or exposure to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) (100 microg/mL), ultraviolet light (15 J/m2), X-ray irradiation (20 Gy), or sphingosine, a sphingolipid breakdown product (5 microM). In contrast, bcl-2 transfectants of TF1 (TF1-bcl2), which we established, were resistant to most of these treatments but remained sensitive to sphingosine. Neither C2- nor C6-ceramide (short-chain ceramide) induced apoptosis in TF1-mock and TF1-bcl2 cells. Sphingosine-induced apoptosis could not be inhibited by fumonisin B1, which can prevent conversion of sphingosine to ceramide, suggesting that sphingosine itself, not ceramide, possesses apoptosis-inducing capability. Western blotting, which revealed a 21-kDa bax protein in untreated cells, revealed the presence of an additional 18-kDa protein in GM-CSF-depleted and MMS- or sphingosine-treated TF1-mock cells. In TF1-bcl2 cells, this protein was not detected after GM-CSF depletion or MMS treatment, but was observed after sphingosine treatment. Immunoprecipitation with anti-bcl2 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-bax antibody, showed that both the 21-kDa bax protein and the 18-kDa protein heterodimerized with bcl-2 protein. These results suggest that sphingosine is a unique reagent for apoptosis and that it can overcome bcl-2 gene expression. Furthermore, induction of 18-kDa bax-related protein may play an important role in apoptosis. Sphingosine, but not ceramide, may prove applicable as a reagent for future cytotoxic drugs used to treat intractable tumors overexpressing bcl-2.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolic effects of epidural blockade (T7-S1) with bupivacaine 0.25% after 12 h fasting and during administration of 4 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dextrose in six healthy volunteers. METHODS: Each volunteer was assigned to randomly undergo a 6-h multiple stable isotope infusion study (3 h fasted, 3 h dextrose infusion) with or without epidural blockade. L-[1-13C]leucine, [6,6-2H2]glucose, and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5]glycerol were infused to measure protein synthesis, breakdown, and amino acid oxidation; glucose production and clearance; and lipolysis. Plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate, glycerol, free fatty acids, insulin, and glucagon were determined. RESULTS: Epidural blockade with bupivacaine had no influence on protein oxidation, breakdown and synthesis, glucose production, glucose clearance and lipolysis in the fasted state. Plasma concentrations of metabolic substrates and hormones also were not affected. Dextrose infusion significantly increased glucose clearance and plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin, while endogenous glucose production and lipolysis decreased to a similar degree in both groups. Protein synthesis, breakdown, and oxidation did not change during dextrose infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural blockade with bupivacaine in the absence of surgery has no effect on fasting protein, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Epidural blockade does not modify the inhibitory influence of dextrose administration on endogenous glucose production and lipolysis.

10982828|t|Role of the Stat4 N domain in receptor proximal tyrosine phosphorylation.
10982828|a|Stat4 is activated by the cytokines interleukin 12 and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and plays a significant role in directing development of naÃ¯ve CD4(+) T cells to the Th1 phenotype. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins undergo phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in homo- and heterodimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. Stat4 can bind to single IFN-gamma-activated sites (GASs) as a dimer or bind two tandem GASs as a pair of STAT dimers, or tetramer, stabilized through N-terminal domain (N domain) interactions between dimers. We uncovered an unexpected effect of the Stat4 N domain in controlling the proximal activation of Stat4 by tyrosine phosphorylation at activated receptor complexes. Mutation of the N domain at tryptophan residue W37, predicted to interrupt N domain dimer formation, unexpectedly prevented IFN-alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stat4 monomer, blocking dimer formation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, N domains appear to exert private STAT functions, since interchanging the N domains between Stat1 and Stat4 prevented receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in one case and interrupted STAT-specific gene activation in another. Finally, replacement of the N domain of Stat1 with that of Stat4 abrogated the normal Stat2 dependence of Stat1 phosphorylation, again suggesting the domains are not equivalent. Thus, in addition to its role in STAT tetramerization, the conserved STAT N domain appears to participate in very proximal steps of receptor-mediated ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.

8593745|t|Hypothesis: apoptosis caused by cytotoxins represents a defensive response that evolved to combat intracellular pathogens.
8593745|a|1. Over 100 different agents have been shown, under certain circumstances, to cause apoptosis, a form of cell death with characteristic morphology. In most cases, the mechanism of cell death is likely to be the same, as expression of the cell death inhibitory gene bcl-2 can frequently prevent apoptotic changes and/or delay cell death. 2. These observations raise the question of how and why cells detect these agents and why they respond by implementing the suicide mechanism that bcl-2 can control. Our hypothesis is that apoptosis is used as an anti-viral strategy, and that cells interpret any metabolic disturbance as evidence of infection by a virus and thereby kill themselves in response to these toxins before they are killed by the action of the toxin itself. 3. Experiments on the effect of sodium azide upon growth factor-dependent cells support this idea. Bcl-2 can delay cell death caused by azide, and inhibit apoptotic changes seen by electron microscopy, but cannot prevent the eventual death of the cells. 4. These ideas suggest that drugs designed to regulate cell death may be useful for the treatment of ischaemic or neoplastic diseases. For example, human cells may activate a suicide pathway in response to sub-lethal amounts of anoxia following a stroke or heart attack and so blocking apoptosis may be a useful therapy to limit tissue damage. On the other hand, increasing the propensity of cells to activate their physiological cell death mechanisms may enhance the effectiveness of toxins designed to kill tumour cells.

23876935|t|Autologous platelet-rich plasma versus dextrose prolotherapy for the treatment of chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis.
23876935|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) compared with dextrose prolotherapy (DP) in patients with chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis (PF) DESIGN: A single-blinded, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic PF confirmed by diagnostic ultrasound (plantar fascia thickness >4 mm) were randomly assigned to the PRP group (n = 10) or the DP group (n = 11). INTERVENTIONS: Each patient received 2 injections into the plantar fascia through a peppering technique under ultrasound guidance at an interval of 2 weeks, either with 2 mL of autologous PRP or 2 mL of 15% dextrose/lidocaine solution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The outcome measures included the pain, disability, and activity limitation subscales, measured by means of the Foot Functional Index. Data were collected before the first injection, at 2 weeks (before the second injection), and at the 2- and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: All patients completed the follow-ups, with the exception of 1 patient in the PRP group. The mean Foot Functional Index total and subcategory score improvements were greater in the PRP group compared with the DP group (improvement with PRP vs DP, total: 30.4% vs 15.1%, pain: 29.7% vs 17.1%, disability: 26.6% vs 14.5%, activity limitation: 28.0% vs 12.4%). However, no statistically significant difference was noted at any follow-up. In the pain and disability subcategories, both groups showed significant improvements at the last re-evaluation. The PRP group also showed significant improvements in the disability and activity limitation subscales at the second re-evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Each treatment seems to be effective for chronic recalcitrant PF, expanding the treatment options for patients in whom conservative care has failed. PRP treatment also may lead to a better initial improvement in function compared with DP treatment.

11945112|t|Cardiac and CNS toxicity of levobupivacaine: strengths of evidence for advantage over bupivacaine.
11945112|a|Bupivacaine is currently the most widely used long-acting local anaesthetic. Its uses include surgery and obstetrics; however, it has been associated with potentially fatal cardiotoxicity, particularly when given intravascularly by accident. Levobupivacaine, a single enantiomer of bupivacaine, has recently been introduced as a new long-acting local anaesthetic with a potentially reduced toxicity compared with bupivacaine. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have compared levobupivacaine with bupivacaine and in most but not all studies there is evidence that levobupivacaine is less toxic. Advantages for levobupivacaine are seen on cardiac sodium and potassium channels, on isolated animal hearts and in whole animals, anaesthetised or awake. In particular the intravascular dose of levobupivacaine required to cause lethality in animals is consistently higher compared with bupivacaine. In awake sheep, for example, almost 78% more levobupivacaine was required to cause death. In contrast, in anaesthetised dogs no differences were seen in the incidence of spontaneous or electrical stimulation- induced ventricular tachycardia and fibrillations among animals exposed to levobupivacaine or bupivacaine. The reversibility of levobupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity has also been assessed. Some data point to an advantage of levobupivacaine over bupivacaine but this potential advantage was not confirmed in a recent study in anaesthetised dogs. Three clinical studies have been conducted using surrogate markers of both cardiac and CNS toxicity. In these studies levobupivacaine or bupivacaine were given by intravascular injection to healthy volunteers. Levobupivacaine was found to cause smaller changes in indices of cardiac contractility and the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and also to have less depressant effect on the electroencephalogram. Assuming that levobupivacaine has the same local anaesthetic potency as bupivacaine, then, all things being equal, it is difficult to argue that levobupivacaine should not displace bupivacaine as the long-acting local anaesthetic of choice. It would appear, however, that levobupivacaine has not yet significantly displaced bupivacaine from the markets in which it is sold. This may be due to a lack of perceived safety benefit and/or consideration of the additional costs that are associated with switching to levobupivacaine, which is approximately 57% more expensive than bupivacaine. If the price of levobupivacaine were closer to bupivacaine then the argument to switch to levobupivacaine would undoubtedly be much stronger. With the continued clinical use of levobupivacaine the database available to make comparisons will increase and this may allow cost-benefit arguments to be made more forcefully for levobupivacaine in the future.

12485870|t|Prodigiosin induces caspase-9 and caspase-8 activation and cytochrome C release in Jurkat T cells.
12485870|a|Prodigiosin (PG) is an active component of bacterial origin, with reported apoptotic effects. We examined the activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3 in PG-treated Jurkat cells in a dose-response study. These caspases were activated in apoptotic cells, as judged by the appearance of cleavage products from procaspases, and cytochrome c (cyt c) was released to the cytosol. In addition, PG induced the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This study demonstrates that the activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3 mediates PG-induced apoptosis.

1404122|t|Accelerated nodulosis during low dose methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. An analysis of ten cases.
1404122|a|OBJECTIVE: To obtain information on the occurrence of accelerated nodulosis during methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), localization, size and presence in heart and lungs of these nodules, predisposing factors, relationship with other extraarticular manifestations (EAM) and their histological features. METHODS: Ten patients with accelerated nodulosis were studied. Four participated in a double blind study of MTX and azathioprine. Patient characteristics, localization, size and histopathology of new nodules were determined. Echocardiography and chest roentgenograms were performed. RESULTS: Accelerated nodulosis occurred exclusively during treatment with MTX in our double blind study. The estimated incidence was 8%. One patient reported was rheumatoid factor negative. Newly developed nodules were small, and located in the fingers in all patients and in additional sites in 7. Pretreatment nodules were not found in the fingers. In one patient nodules on the mitral valve were found, but this was not likely to be associated with the use of MTX. No new pulmonary nodules were found. Other EAM developed concurrently in 4 patients. Histopathology revealed typical rheumatoid nodules. In 3 patients nodulosis regressed after MTX was stopped. In 2 of them they recurred after a rechallenge. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated nodulosis during MTX for RA is not rare, and occurs despite good clinical response of polyarthritis. Rheumatoid factor positivity is not a prerequisite. New nodules are small and preferentially located in the fingers. Recurrence after rechallenge with MTX suggests causality.

19200365|t|Preoperative short-course radiotherapy versus combined radiochemotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer: a multi-centre prospectively randomised study of the Berlin Cancer Society.
19200365|a|BACKGROUND: The additional use of radiotherapy has changed the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) dramatically. But a major achievement has been the development of total mesorectal excision (TME) as a surgical standard and the recognition that the surgeon is the predominant prognostic factor. The benefit of preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (SCRT; five fractions each of 5 Gy), initially established by the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial, has been demonstrated in conjunction with TME by the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group. The concept of combined neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (conventional radiation of about 50 Gy with chemotherapy) has not been compared over surgery alone with TME. However, the German Rectal Cancer Study Group recently demonstrated that preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) was better than postoperative radiochemotherapy in terms of local control. METHODS AND DESIGN: Patients with histological proven rectal cancer staged T2N+ or T3 are randomized to receive either SCRT (25 Gy in five fractions of 5 Gy) plus TME-surgery within 5 days or RCT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil) plus TME-surgery 4-6 weeks later. All patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy (12 weeks continuous infusional 5-FU) and are followed up for 5 years. TME-quality is independently documented by the surgeon and the pathologist. Hypothesis of the study is that RCT is superior to SCRT in terms of local recurrence after five years. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, disease-free survival, complete resection rate (R0 resection), rate of sphincter saving resection, acute and late toxicity (radiation related side effects), and quality of life (including long term bowel function). DISCUSSION: Similar long-term survival, local control and late morbidity have been reported for both concepts of preoperative therapy in non-comparative studies. In addition to other ongoing (and recently published) comparative trials we include a larger number of patients for adequate power, apply quality-controlled TME and try to avoid the adjuvant treatment bias by mandatory adjuvant chemotherapy in both groups. Further more, stratification of the initially planned surgical procedure and sphincter-preservation will generate valid evidence whether RCT will allow a less aggressive (sphincter saving) surgical approach.

18331669|t|A Markov cost-utility analysis of escitalopram and duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.
18331669|a|OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life weeks of duloxetine and escitalopram. RESEARCH DESIGN: A probabilistic Markov cost-utility analysis with a time horizon of 1 year using data from placebo controlled randomized clinical trials for both products. METHODS: Efficacy was defined as remission of depressive symptoms and converted to utilities. Side effects were incorporated using rates from clinical trials and converted to utilities to define treatment effectiveness. The effectiveness outcome was quality adjusted life weeks (QALWs). Estimates of effectiveness (efficacy and side effects) used beta distributions and costs used gamma distributions. Using a managed care perspective, medication costs and physician office visits were included in the model, along with costs associated with treatment failure. Antidepressant costs were obtained using average wholesale price minus 20%. Physician visit costs were obtained from the 2006 US Medicare fee schedule for physician services. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using 1000 trials with both first- and second-order sampling. RESULTS: Over 1 year, the estimated mean quality-adjusted life weeks was 41.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.7-41.3) for escitalopram and 38.2 (95% CI: 37.9-38.4) for duloxetine. The mean annual total medical cost for escitalopram was $907 (95% CI: $894-$919) and $1633 (95% CI: $1614-$1654) for duloxetine. Limitations to this analysis include using separate studies examining the efficacy and adverse events of either escitalopram or duloxetine, assuming the switch, augmentation, and titration rates for duloxetine to be similar to escitalopram, and using utility estimates from published literature for the antidepressant adverse events. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that escitalopram was more effective in terms of QALWs and less costly than duloxetine for treatment of depression.

10359528|t|Amplification and overexpression of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/MET) in rat DMBA sarcomas.
10359528|a|In the present study subcutaneous fibrosarcomas were induced by the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) in rats from F1 generation cross breedings of two different inbred strains. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, which allows detection of DNA sequence copy changes, was applied to one of the tumors and it was found that there were increased copy numbers of sequences at chromosome 4q12-q21 in this tumor. We have previously determined that the loci for the hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Hgfr/Met), a protooncogene, are situated in this particular chromosome region. Using probes for the two genes in FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and in Southern blots we found that the Hgfr/Met gene was amplified in five of the 19 sarcomas studied, and that the Hgf gene was coamplified in two of them. Northern and Western blots and tyrosine phosphorylation analysis showed that the HGF receptor was overexpressed and functional in all five tumors, as well as in two additional tumors. In summary, both amplification and overexpression of the Hgfr/Met gene was found in about 25% of DMBA-induced experimental rat sarcomas, and HGF receptor overexpression alone was seen in two additional tumors. Possibly this reflects an involvement in paracrine or autocrine stimulation of growth and invasiveness by HGF. Our finding could provide a rodent model system to increased knowledge about causality and therapy, which may be applicable to the sizeable fraction of human musculoskeletal tumors displaying MET overexpression.

12967870|a|BACKGROUND: We present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. CASES: Five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. The hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. Thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary Medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. OBSERVATIONS: The culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the Medpor implant patient. Culture for the remaining patient was negative . CONCLUSIONS: If there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. Systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. If no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.

15064270|t|Ophthalmic artery blood flow velocity increases during hypocapnia.
15064270|a|PURPOSE: The effects of anesthetic management on blood flow to the optic nerve have not been well-studied. The ophthalmic artery provides the majority of the blood supply to the optic nerve via several smaller branches. Retinal blood flow has been shown to react to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) similar to intracranial vessels, but insufficient data exist for the ophthalmic artery. The purpose of this study is to examine the CO(2)-reactivity of the ophthalmic artery. METHODS: Eight healthy awake subjects aged 28 to 50 yr were tested for CO(2)-reactivity in the ophthalmic artery using transcranial Doppler (TCD) insonation of blood flow velocity (V(op)), while simultaneously recording the V(op) of the middle cerebral artery (V(mca)) as an internal control. V(op) and V(mca) recordings were made under hypocapnic, normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. RESULTS: The CO(2)-reactivity slope of V(mca) was 3.27% per mmHg PaCO(2). From normocapnia to hypercapnia, V(op) did not change significantly (mean +/- SD, 18 +/- 4 cm*sec(-1) to 18 +/- 6 cm*sec(-1)), (end-tidal CO(2), etCO(2), = 43 +/- 5 mmHg to 53 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively). In contrast, V(op) increased significantly under hypocapnic conditions (etCO(2) = 26 +/- 4 mmHg) to 25 +/- 5 cm*sec(-1) (P < 0.05). The CO(2)-reactivity slope of V(op) from normocapnia to hypocapnia was 2.57% per mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that V(op) increases with hypocapnia, but is unaffected by hypercapnia. The anastomoses of the ophthalmic artery with the external carotid artery, which displays a relatively fixed resistance, may account for these findings.

23455801|t|An unusual case of invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast.
23455801|a|Invasive papillary carcinoma is a rare variant of breast cancer. We report an unusual case of invasive papillary carcinoma of the breast with high nuclear grade, brisk mitosis, necrosis, extensive apocrine differentiation, and intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate; additionally triple-negativity for estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her2 neu. The patient underwent modified radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. But, it was a node negative breast carcinoma. Increasing the awareness of this clinicopathologic entity would be helpful in avoiding overtreatment of patients with this cancer even if the tumor has negative morphological and immunohistochemical prognosticators.

11785821|t|Effects of ethanol intoxication on speech suprasegmentals.
11785821|a|The effects of ingesting ethanol have been shown to be somewhat variable in humans. To date, there appear to be but few universals. Yet, the question often arises: is it possible to determine if a person is intoxicated by observing them in some manner? A closely related question is: can speech be used for this purpose and, if so, can the degree of intoxication be determined? One of the many issues associated with these questions involves the relationships between a person's paralinguistic characteristics and the presence and level of inebriation. To this end, young, healthy speakers of both sexes were carefully selected and sorted into roughly equal groups of light, moderate, and heavy drinkers. They were asked to produce four types of utterances during a learning phase, when sober and at four strictly controlled levels of intoxication (three ascending and one descending). The primary motor speech measures employed were speaking fundamental frequency, speech intensity, speaking rate and nonfluencies. Several statistically significant changes were found for increasing intoxication; the primary ones included rises in F0, in task duration and for nonfluencies. Minor gender differences were found but they lacked statistical significance. So did the small differences among the drinking category subgroups and the subject groupings related to levels of perceived intoxication. Finally, although it may be concluded that certain changes in speech suprasegmentals will occur as a function of increasing intoxication, these patterns cannot be viewed as universal since a few subjects (about 20%) exhibited no (or negative) changes.

16403516|t|The anti-angiogenic peptide anginex disrupts the cell membrane.
16403516|a|Anginex is a synthetic beta-sheet peptide with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity. When added to cultured endothelial cells at concentrations ranging from 2.5 microM to 25 microM, anginex induced cell death, which was reflected by a strong increase of subdiploid cells and fragments, loss of cellular ATP, and LDH release. Cytotoxicity remained the same whether cells were treated with anginex at 4 degrees C or at 37 degrees C. At low temperatures, fluorescein-conjugated anginex accumulated on the endothelial surface, but did not reach into the cytoplasm, indicating that the cell membrane is the primary target for the peptide. Within minutes of treatment, anginex caused endothelial cells to take up propidium iodide and undergo depolarization, both parameters characteristic for permeabilization of the cell membrane. This process was amplified when cells were activated with hydrogen peroxide. Red blood cell membranes were essentially unaffected by anginex. Anginex bound lipid bilayers with high affinity and with a clear preference for anionic over zwitterionic phospholipids. Structural studies by circular dichroism and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance showed that anginex forms a beta-sheet and adopts a unique and highly ordered conformation upon binding to lipid membranes. This is consistent with lipid micellization or the formation of pore-forming beta-barrels. The data suggest that the cytotoxicity of anginex stems from its ability to target and disrupt the endothelial cell membrane, providing a possible explanation for the angiostatic activity of the peptide.

16210393|t|Striatal alpha6* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: potential targets for Parkinson's disease therapy.
16210393|a|The presence of distinct nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes in specific central nervous system (CNS) areas offers the possibility of developing targeted therapies for diseases involving the affected brain region. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal system. alpha6-containing nAChRs (designated alpha6(*)1 nAChRs) have a relatively selective localization to the nigrostriatal pathway and a limited number of other CNS regions. In addition to a unique distribution, this subtype has a distinct pharmacology and specifically interacts with alpha-conotoxinMII, a toxin key in its identification and characterization. alpha6(*) nAChRs are also regulated in a novel manner, with a decrease in their number after nicotine treatment rather than the increase observed for alpha4(*) nAChRs. Striatal alpha6(*) receptors were functional and mediate dopamine release, suggesting that they have a presynaptic localization. This is further supported by lesion studies showing that both alpha6(*) nAChR sites and their functions are dramatically decreased with dopaminergic nerve terminal loss, in contrast to only small declines in alpha4(*) and no change in alpha7(*) receptors. Although the role of nigrostriatal alpha6(*) nAChRs is only beginning to be understood, an involvement in motor behavior is emerging. This latter observation coupled with the finding that nicotine protects against nigrostriatal damage suggest that alpha6(*) nAChRs may represent unique targets for neurodegenerative disorders linked to the nigrostriatal system such as Parkinson's disease.

23125081|t|ST13, a proliferation regulator, inhibits growth and migration of colorectal cancer cell lines.
23125081|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: ST13, is the gene encoding the HSP70 interacting protein (HIP). Previous research has shown that ST13 mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. This study aims at the role of ST13 in the proliferation and migration of CRC cells. METHODS: The transcript level of ST13 in different CRC cell lines was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). ST13-overexpressed and ST13-knockdown CRC cells were constructed respectively by lentiviral transduction, followed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, plate colony formation, cell-cycle analysis, and migration assays to evaluate the influence of ST13 on proliferation and migration in vitro. Moreover, a mouse xenograft study was performed to test in vivo tumorigenicity of ST13-knockdown CRC cells. RESULTS: Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of ST13 in CRC cells inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro. In contrast, down-regulation of ST13 by lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference in CRC cells significantly increased cell proliferation and cloning efficiency in vitro. In addition, down-regulation of ST13 expression significantly increased the tumorigenicity of CRC cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: ST13 gene is a proliferation regulator that inhibits tumor growth in CRC and may affect cell migration.

8453599|t|Chromosome abnormalities in patients treated with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation.
8453599|a|Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) offers potentially curative therapy for patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma, yet little information exists about the chromosome abnormalities observed in ABMT recipients. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were reported by van den Akker. We report the cytogenetic results of 55 patients who underwent ABMT between November 1987 and July 1990: acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL, 22), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, eight), Hodgkin's disease (seven), lymphoma (16), other (two). ANLL patients received busulfan and cytoxan, and the others received cytoxan and total body irradiation as their preparative regimen before transplant. BM was purged ex vivo with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) at 30-100 micrograms/ml before reinfusion to kill tumor cells. Cytogenetic analysis was performed before and after transplant. Between one and four posttransplant specimens of BM were analyzed per patient (range 36-921 days). Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 14 of 55 patients after transplant. Seven had clonal abnormalities; all were in leukemic relapse, and one karyotype had complex rearrangements. Clonal abnormalities of chromosome 1 were not observed. Seven patients had nonclonal changes, and three of these have had overt clinical relapse. Our data suggest that clonal abnormalities observed posttransplant are best explained by clinical relapse of tumor and that ex vivo marrow purging with 4-HC is not likely to induce clonal chromosome abnormalities in normal cells. Long-term observation of these patients will be required to answer that question definitively, however.

8786761|t|Effect of glucose and thiamine concentrations on the formation of macroconidia in dermatophytes. Occurrence of dysgonic Microsporum canis strains in Athens, Greece.
8786761|a|Data collected from multiple trials with 110 fresh and preserved clinical isolates of Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes, T. violaceum, T. rubrum, T. verrucosum, Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton floccosum revealed that production of macroconidia depends on glucose and thiamine concentrations in the medium. Optimal macroconidia production was obtained at the critical concentrations of 5 g l-1 glucose and 0.6 g l-1 thiamine when the two compounds were used in combination. The same conditions also encouraged macroconidia production in aconidial strains of T. verrucosum. Cutaneous inoculation in immunocompetent laboratory rabbits further enhanced the macroconidia producing capacity of the tested strains. Emphasis was placed on the occurrence of dysgonic/atypical strains of M. canis, which readily reverted to their typical phenotypes after growth on medium supplemented with 0.6 g l-1 thiamine, a process greatly augmented after cutaneous animal inoculation. It was verified that selective exogenous factors affect macroconidial production and that the dysgonic group of M. canis constitutes an epidemiologically significant group in the Greater Athens area. This is the first report of the occurrence of such M. canis strains from Greece.

7772833|t|Purification and characterization of three mitogenic lectins from the roots of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana).
7772833|a|Three mitogenic lectins, designated PL-A, PL-B, and PL-C, were purified from the roots of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) using Q-Sepharose column chromatography followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, hydrophobic chromatography on Butyl-Toyopearl, and FPLC on a Mono-Q column. PL-A, PL-B, and PL-C are acidic proteins having isoelectric points of 4.35 and their apparent molecular masses were 22, 48, and 21 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, respectively. The three lectins have similar amino acid compositions rich in half-cystine and similar N-terminal sequences, indicating that they are homologous proteins. Identical sequences of N-terminal regions and six corresponding tryptic peptides in PL-A and PL-B suggested that PL-A may be an N-terminal half fragment of PL-B. Although all of three lectins have mitogenic activities, PL-B is a mitogenic lectin with the most potent hemagglutinating and mitogenic activities, and PL-C has almost no hemagglutinating activity.

2182031|t|Antimalarial action of flavin analogues seems not be due to inhibition of glutathione reductase of host erythrocytes.
2182031|a|A series of 10-(4'-chlorophenyl)-3-substituted flavins (1a-f) were examined with respect to their antimalarial properties. They were tested against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro and Plasmodium vinckei vinckei in vivo. The proposition that they might act through glutathione reductase (GR) (EC 1.6.4.2) inhibition has been studied. Inhibition of P. falciparum in vitro by these compounds shows only slight variation between analogues; in contrast, inhibition of human erythrocyte GR by members of the same series is highly variable, indicating that this is probably not their primary mode of antimalarial action. Results of the P. vinckei vinckei screen showed that 10-(4'-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl,3-ethyl and 3-propyl substituted flavins are active in vivo over the dose range screened (10-70 mg/kg).

19861020|t|Molecular characterisation of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Morocco.
19861020|a|Mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampicin (RMP) resistance were studied in 47 RMP-resistant and 147 RMP-susceptible clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Morocco using probe-based assay and DNA sequencing. RMP-resistant mutations were identified in 85% of RMP-resistant isolates. No mutations were observed among the 147 RMP-susceptible strains. Sequence analysis identified 10 alleles, including two deletions not previously reported. Nucleotide changes at codons 531, 526 and 516 were the most prominent, accounting for 74.4% of our RMP-resistant strains. These results demonstrate that resistance genotyping at these codons would be a good marker for the rapid detection of RMP resistance.

11329936|t|Sensitivity of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumor lines to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hyperthermia.
11329936|a|BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma has failed to produce many cures secondary to high rates of intraperitoneal relapses and liver metastases. The aim of this ex vivo study was to evaluate the inherent chemosensitivity, radiosensitivity and hyperthermic sensitivity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to investigate the usefulness of a 3-(4,5-dimetylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay utilized in each sensitivity test. METHODS: Nine human pancreatic adenocarcinomas were tested ex vivo after growth in nude mice. After 72 hr of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hyperthermia, efficacy was assessed using MTT assay to determine the ratio of surviving fraction of treated cells-to-that of untreated control cells (TIC ratio). RESULTS: Tumor sensitivities as measured by the IC50 (drug concentration producing 50% growth inhibition) varied largely between drugs, ranging larger than 3 x 10(5) ng/mL for 5-FU, larger than 1.5 x 10(2) ng/mL for MMC, 20 ng/mL to 1.4 x 10(3) ng/mL for ADM, and 80 ng/mL to 2.4 x 10(3) ng/mL for CDDP. D0 (dose of radiation reducing the surviving fraction to 37%) ranged from 3.2 to 8.3 Gy (mean +/- standard deviation; 5.8 +/- 1.6 Gy). For hyperthermia, the mean T50 (duration of hyperthermia reducing the surviving fraction to 50%) at 43 degrees C was 9.4 +/- 3.3 min 4.8 to 14.2 min). The T/C ratio at 43 degrees C for 12 min was less than that at 41 degrees C for 30 min (p = .01; the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). No clear relationship among chemosensitivity, radiosensitivity, hyperthermic sensitivity and pathologic features could be established. CONCLUSIONS: Nine human pancreatic adenocarcinomas varied widely in their sensitivity to chemotherapies, especially for 5-FU. These results suggested that MTT assay may be useful in excluding some less sensitive cases of pancreatic cancer. For hyperthermia, sufficient therapeutic time and temperature may realize enough effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

17443568|t|Interventions for pityriasis rosea.
17443568|a|BACKGROUND: Pityriasis rosea is a scaly rash that mainly affects young adults. It can be very itchy but most people recover within 2 to 12 weeks. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for pityriasis rosea. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (December 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1976 to January 2005), LILACS (1982 to January 2005), BIOSIS Preview (1980 to June 2002), and ongoing trials databases. We scanned bibliographies of published studies, abstracts from dermatology conference proceedings, corresponded with trialists and contacted the pharmaceutical industry. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for pityriasis rosea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials involving 148 people were included. One poor quality trial (23 people), compared intravenous glycyrrhizin and intravenous procaine. It found no significant difference between the two interventions for treating symptoms and rash. One fair quality trial (85 people), compared the oral antihistamine dexchlorpheniramine (4 mg), the oral steroid betamethasone (500 mcg), and a combination of betamethasone (250 mcg) and dexchlorpheniramine (2 mg). It found no significant difference in itch resolution at two weeks, as rated by the participants, between dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone, and the combination of dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone. However, both dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone alone seem to be better at clearing rash than the combination of dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone. These interventions were not compared with placebo. The small good quality trial (40 people) that compared oral erythromycin and placebo found that erythromycin was more effective than placebo in terms of rash improvement, as rated by the trialists, after two weeks (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.91 to 88.64). It was also more effective in decreasing the itch score (difference of 3.95 points, 95% CI 3.37 to 4.53). No serious adverse effects were reported for the interventions. Two out of 17 people on oral erythromycin and 1 out of 17 on placebo reported minor gastrointestinal upset. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found inadequate evidence for efficacy for most treatments for pityriasis rosea. Oral erythromycin may be effective in treating the rash and decreasing the itch. However, this result should be treated with caution since it comes from only one small RCT. More research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of erythromycin and other treatments.

15685349|a|AIM: To study the secretory activity and androgen regulation of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in epithelial cell cultures from human epididymis. METHODS: Tissue was obtained from patients undergoing therapeutic orchidectomy for prostatic cancer. Epithelial cell cultures were obtained from the caput, corpus and cauda epididymides. Enzymatic activity was measured in conditioned media by colorimetric methods in absence or presence of 1, 10 or 100 nmol/L testosterone. The effect of 1 micromol/L flutamide was also evaluated. RESULTS: GPx activity was higher in cultures from corpus and cauda than caput epididymidis. The presence of different concentrations of testosterone increase enzyme activity in cell cultures from all epididymal regions. Addition of flutamide reverses the androgen dependent increase of GPx activity. CONCLUSION: GPx activity is secreted from human epididymal cells in a region dependent manner and is regulated by androgens.

11875767|t|Pentoxifylline downregulates nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced by mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan in a macrophage cell line.
11875767|a|Pentoxifylline (PTX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is known to downregulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion induced by lipopolysacchride (LPS) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). We have had limited success in treating leprosy reactions, including erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), in which TNF-alpha has been identified as a major proinflammatory cytokine. PTX inhibited production of NO (IC50 approximately equal to 1.0 mg/ml) and TNF-alpha (IC50 approximately equal to 0.05 mg/ml) in a dose-dependent fashion. As little as 0.5 mg/ml of PTX decreased NO production and 0.01 mg/ml of PTX inhibited TNF-alpha production. Western blot analyses demonstrated that iNOS was suppressed by PTX. Northern blot analyses showed significant reduction of TNF-alpha mRNA. We conclude that PTX is an effective inhibitor of lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-induced TNF-alpha production at both the product and transcriptional levels in our macrophage cell line. PTX also showed moderate inhibition of NO at the product level as well as translation of iNOS.

9136240|t|An analysis of children with typhoid fever admitted in 1991.
9136240|a|In 28 children, with bacteriologically and/or serologically diagnosed typhoid fever treated at KEM Hospital, Bombay in 1991, initially one of the three recommended drugs (viz. chloramphenicol, amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole) was given for 7 days for defervescence to occur. In those who failed to respond, a second trial of therapy with one of the other two drugs was initiated, after omitting the first drug. A second failure of therapy was taken as an indication to use ciprofloxacin singly. Eventually, 18 (64.3%) cases responded to chloramphenicol or amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole. Ciprofloxacin was used in 19(35.7%) cases. the failure rate of treatment with chloramphenicol was 50%, with amoxycillin 71.4%, with co-trimoxazole 75% and 0% with ciprofloxacin. An analysis of the 28 cases revealed that apart from fever (in 100%), splenomegaly (in 82.1%) was the most important clinical pointer to diagnosis, along with absolute eosinopenia (in 71.4%). There were no major complications, except 2 cases with typhoid hepatitis who responded to choramphenicol and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi in 7 cases, of which 5 (72%) were multidrug resistant S. typhi. There were no characteristic clinical features to identify multi-drug resistant typhoid fever.

12393542|t|Targeting p38 MAPK inhibits multiple myeloma cell growth in the bone marrow milieu.
12393542|a|p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a member of the MAPK family which is activated by cytokines and growth factors, but its role in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the specific p38 MAPK inhibitor VX-745 inhibits interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), without affecting their viability. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced IL-6 secretion in BMSCs is also inhibited by VX-745. Importantly, VX-745 inhibits both MM cell proliferation and IL-6 secretion in BMSCs triggered by adherence of MM cells to BMSCs, suggesting that it can inhibit paracrine MM cell growth in the BM milieu and overcome cell adhesion-related drug resistance. These studies therefore identify p38 MAPK as a novel therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcome in MM.

8761343|t|Amyloidogenic processing of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein in vitro and its modulation by metal ions and tacrine.
8761343|a|Recent studies implicate that excessive amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing may be the final common pathway involved in the pathogensis of AD. In attempts to identify the proteases or factors leading to excessive amyloid deposition, we evaluated the potential role of acethylcholinesterase (AChE) and its associated protease for amyloidogenic processing of APP in vitro. Prolonged incubation of a recombinant APP770 with AChE produced several amyloidogenic fragments accumulating a relatively stable a 18 kDa A beta (amyloid beta-protein) bearing carboxy terminal peptide, which was further degraded by an increased concentration of AChE. Protease inhibitory profiles confirmed the trypsin-like serine protease activity present in AChE preparation. This observed APP processing was significantly enhanced by Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ at 1 mM concentration and modulated in concentration dependent manners by metal ions such as Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, Al3+, or a tacrine, a centrally active cholinesterase inhibitor. Our data imply that AChE and its associated protease may be involved in the generation a 18 kDa amyloidogenic peptide under certain physiological condition in vivo and that the gradual changes in their proteolytic activities or locations and the locally disturbed metal homeostasis could be factors associated with abnormal accumulation of APP, eventually leading to amyloid deposition in AD brain. In addition, zinc or tacrine treatment of AD patients with high dosage or in the long term may have effects on the process of amyloidogensis.

12115659|t|Immunosuppressive activity of capsaicinoids: capsiate derived from sweet peppers inhibits NF-kappaB activation and is a potent antiinflammatory compound in vivo.
12115659|a|Capsiate and its dihydroderivatives are the major capsaicinoids of sweet pepper. These new capsaicinoids do not activate the vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1) but they share with capsaicin (CPS)some biological activities mediated in a VR1-independent fashion. In this study we show that CPS and nordihydrocapsiate (CPT) inhibit early and late events in T cell activation, including CD69, CD25 and ICAM-1 cell surface expression, progression to the S phase of the cell cycle and proliferation in response to TCR and CD28 co-engagement. Moreover, both CPS and CPT inhibit NF-kappaB activation in response to different agents including TNF-alpha. CPS itself does not affect the DNA-binding ability of NF-kappaB but it prevents IkappaB kinase activation and IkappaBalpha degradation in a dose-dependent manner, without inhibiting the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, p38, extracellular regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase. Moreover, intraperitoneal pretreatment with CPT prevented mice from lethal septic shock induced by lipopolysaccharide. In a second model of inflammation CPT pretreatment greatly reduced the extensive damage in the glandular epithelium observed in the bowel of DSS-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that CPT and related synthetic analogues target specific pathways involved in inflammation, and hold considerable potential for dietary health benefits as well as for pharmaceutical development.

9688405|t|In-vitro maturation of human germinal vesicle stage oocytes: role of cumulus cells and epidermal growth factor in the culture medium.
9688405|a|In-vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes is a promising technique to reduce the costs and avert the side-effects of gonadotrophin stimulation for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). The pregnancy rates from oocytes matured in vitro are much lower than those of in-vivo stimulation cycles indicating that optimization of IVM remains a challenge. Therefore, we investigated the effect of supplementation of the medium with gonadotrophins, oestradiol and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the effect of retaining or removing the cumulus cells on nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of immature oocytes. Human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes obtained after gonadotrophin stimulation for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) were cultured in a complex defined medium either supplemented with gonadotrophins, oestradiol and physiological concentrations of EGF (2 ng/ml) or gonadotrophins and oestradiol alone. The cumulus cells were either removed or kept intact. In GV stage oocytes cultured without cumulus (group I) significantly more oocytes reached the metaphase II (MII) stage at 30 h in media supplemented with EGF (64.3 versus 33.9%, P < 0.003). For oocytes cultured with intact cumulus (group II), more oocytes reached MII at 30 h than in group I, but there was no difference in medium with or without EGF supplementation (81.8 and 79.8% respectively). Cytoplasmic maturation of MII oocytes was judged from their capability to activate and fertilize after ICSI. In group I, the rates of activation and normal fertilization were similar. However, in group II, significantly more oocytes underwent normal fertilization in the EGF-supplemented than the unsupplemented group (71.7 versus 45.6%, P < 0.05). The cleavage rates of the fertilized oocytes were similar in the sibling oocyte subgroups cultured with or without EGF supplementation, but the overall cleavage rates were higher in cumulus-intact compared to cumulus-denuded oocytes (88.9 versus 47.8%, P < 0.001). Thus, supplementation of the maturation medium with EGF and maintenance of the cumulus during culture improve the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of human oocytes in vitro.

9147707|t|Once-daily fixed dose combinations of verapamil and trandolapril in black patients with mild to moderate hypertension: a new choice for first line treatment.
9147707|a|Using ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, a potent ACE-inhibitor/calcium channel blocker combination was tested in 21 Black patients (age 52 +/- 10 years; 10 males, 11 females) with mild to moderate hypertension (mean 12-hour daytime diastolic BP > or = 90 mmHg and < or = 114 mmHg). After a 14-day wash-out and a 14-day placebo run-in period, therapy was initiated with verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg. At monthly visits, if mean daytime diastolic BP remained > or = 90 mmHg, the dose combination was uptitrated stepwise to verapamil 240 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, verapamil 360 mg plus trandolapril 4 mg, and finally hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg were added. Mean 24-hour BP dropped from 150 +/- 14/96 +/- 7 mmHg at baseline to 131 +/- 13/82 +/- 8 mmHg after 4 months treatment (p < 0.001). In 16 (76%) patients mean 24-hour diastolic BP was < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial and 15 (71%) patients achieved a reduction of > 10 mmHg. Five out of 5 patients finishing on dose I were controlled, 5/6 patients on dose II, 5/8 patients on dose III, and 1/2 patients who received additional hydrochlorothiazide. The 24-hour BP load fell from 72 +/- 8% at baseline to 35 +/- 25% in 4 months (p < 0.001). Mean diastolic BP drop for the 2 peak hours during daytime was 20 mmHg and for the last 2 hours of monitoring was 13 mmHg, resulting in a trough to peak ratio of 65%. There were no significant adverse events or biochemical abnormalities. It is concluded that the combination doses tested showed a sustained and marked antihypertensive effect throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, and the starting dose (verapamil 180 mg plus trandolapril 2 mg) seems appropriate in this group of patients.

7506644|t|Prospective assessment of incidence of fulminant hepatitis in post-transfusion hepatitis: a study of 504 cases.
7506644|a|The incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis and "fulminant" hepatitis was investigated by a plan devised at our hospital in December 1982. Of 2959 blood recipients between January 1982 and December 1988, 504 (22.5%) developed posttransfusion hepatitis, with a mean transfusion volume of 10.2 units. Of the 504 cases of posttransfusion hepatitis, "icteric" (T-Bil > 2.0 mg/dl) and "overt icteric" hepatitis (T-Bil > 5.0 mg-dl) developed in 111 cases (22.0%) and 28 cases (5.6%), respectively. Of the 28 overt icteric hepatitis cases, 13 (2.8%) were thought to be true overt icteric posttransfusion hepatitis because the icterus was caused by other reasons in the other 15 cases (seven neonatal jaundice, four hemolytic anemia, one radiation hepatitis, one halothane-induced hepatitis; two other cases were excluded because chronic liver disease was diagnosed by imaging procedures despite serum ALTs in the normal range before transfusion). The anti-HCV serostatus was investigated in five of the 13 true overt icteric posttransfusion hepatitis patients using blood specimens taken 180 days or more following the onset of posttransfusion hepatitis. Anti-HCV seroconversion occurred in three of the five cases (60%). HCV seroconversions were not seen in the cases in which the icterus was due to other reasons.

19645647|t|Injection of medications used in opioid substitution treatment in Australia after the introduction of a mixed partial agonist-antagonist formulation.
19645647|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the levels and predictors of injection of buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX)--a combination of a partial opioid agonist and an opioid antagonist for treating opioid dependence--which was specifically developed to limit injecting. Comparison was made with injecting of two other opioid substitution treatment medications, methadone and buprenorphine (BPN); severe harms have been documented after injection of the latter. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Injecting was studied in regular injecting drug users ("IDUs") and current opioid substitution treatment clients ("clients"). Regular IDUs are interviewed annually in each Australian capital city (about 900 per year) and data for 2003-2007 were used; 399 clients were interviewed in 2007. Data on injection of opioid substitution treatment medications between 2003 and 2007 were adjusted for availability of medications (from national sales data for methadone, BPN and BNX). Predictors of injecting were analysed by multiple regression analyses. SETTING: Capital cities of all Australian states and territories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Injection of opioid substitution treatment medications among individuals both in and out of treatment. RESULTS: In the year after its introduction in Australia, BNX was injected less frequently and by fewer regular IDUs and clients compared with BPN, particularly when differences in the availability of medications were taken into account. Some individuals did nonetheless regularly inject BNX. Injection of methadone, BPN and BNX was more likely to occur among those injecting other pharmaceutical opioids. CONCLUSIONS: A partial opioid agonist-antagonist combination appears to be less commonly and less frequently injected by clients in treatment and IDUs who are not. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term trends in use and harms.

20933305|a|A series of 2-[N-aryl-2-oxo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethanehydrazonoyl]-6-methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinones 5 were prepared by coupling the diazonium salt of aniline derivatives with 2-(4-chlorobenzoylmethylene)-6-methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 4 in sodium hydroxide solution. The structures of these newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analyses and the tautomeric structure of these compounds was discussed. All the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities, some of which exhibited moderate activity. Also, the above compounds were evaluated for their antitumor activity against a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA. Compounds 5b, 5d and 5i showed good cytotoxic activities against the tested cell lines. In addition, the newly synthesized compounds were screened for their 5a-reductase inhibitor activity and all the tested compounds showed activities in descending order as follows 5b, 5c, 5g, 5j, 5d, 5h, 5f, 5e and 5i.

10583180|t|Crusted (Norwegian) scabies in a patient with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
10583180|a|A 13-year-old girl with severe non-mutilating recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB) was admitted to hospital because of a Staphyloccus aureussepsos, deterioration of her general condition and worsening of her skin disease, which itched severely. In addition to the blisters and erosions normally seen, she was covered from head to toe with scales and hyperkeratotic crusts. Despite intensive topical therapy, her skin condition did not improve significantly until scabies was detected and treated 1 week after admission. Because of the huge number of mites found and the crusted appearance, a diagnosis of crusted (Norwegian) scabies was made. She was successfully treated with two doses of ivermectin orally and one application of lindane ointment. Permethrin cream was not tolerated. In this patient crusted scabies may have developed because of: (i) a modified host response due to malnourishment; (ii) inability to scratch because of the absence of fingernails; and (iii) abnormal scratching behaviour because of the vulnerability of EB skin, or a combination of these factors. Limited isolation measures were taken on admission and full measures were taken immediately after the diagnosis of crusted scabies was made. Prophylactic treatment of ward personnel was not undertaken. Fortunately, there was not an outbreak of scabies in the hospital.

10337657|t|Effect of total androgen ablation on pathologic stage and resection limit status of prostate cancer. Initial results of the Italian PROSIT study.
10337657|a|The likelihood of finding organ-confined untreated prostate cancer (PCa) by pathological examination at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) is only 50% in patients with clinically organ-confined disease. In addition, tumour is present at the resection margin in approximately 30% of clinical T2 (clinical stage B) cases. The issue of clinical "understaging" and of resection limit positivity have led to the development of novel management practices, including "neoadjuvant" hormonal therapy (NHT). The optimal duration of NHT is unknown. We undertook the present analysis to evaluate the effect of NHT on pathologic stage of PCa and resection limit status in patients with prostate cancer and treated with total androgen ablation either for three or six months before RP. Between January 1996 and February 1998, 259 men with prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection in the 26 centres participating in the Italian randomised prospective PROSIT study. Whole mount sectioning of the complete RP specimens was adopted in each centre for accurately evaluating the pathologic stage and resection limit status. By February 1998, haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 155 RP specimens had been received and evaluated by the reviewing pathologist (RM). 64 cases had not been treated with total androgen ablation (e.g. NHT) before RP was performed, whereas 58 and 33 had been treated for three and six months, respectively. 114 patients were clinical stage B whereas 41 were clinical stage C. After three months of total androgen ablation, pathological stage B was more prevalent among patients with clinical B tumours, compared with untreated patients (57% in treated patients vs. 36% in untreated). The percentage of cancers with negative margins was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy than those treated with immediate surgery alone (69% vs. 42%, respectively). After six months of NHT therapy the proportion of patients with pathological stage B (67% vs. 36%, respectively) and negative margins was greater than after 3 months (92% vs. 42%, respectively). For clinical C tumours, the prevalence of pathological stage B and negative margins in the patients treated for either 3 or 6 months was not as high as in the clinical B tumours, when compared with the untreated group (pathological stage B: 31% and 33% vs. 6% in the clinical C cases, respectively. Negative margins: 56% and 67% vs. 31%, respectively). The initial results of this study suggest that total androgen ablation before RP is beneficial in men with clinical stage B because of the significant pathological downstaging and decrease in the number of positive margins in the RP specimens. These two effects are more pronounced after six months of NHT than after three months of therapy. The same degree of beneficial effects are not observed in clinical C tumours.

18668435|t|Organic cation transporters.
18668435|a|1. Organic cation transporters (OCTs) translocate endogenous (e.g. dopamine) and exogenous (e.g. drugs) substances of cationic nature and, therefore, play an important role in the detoxification of exogenous compounds. This review aims to furnish essential information on OCTs, with an emphasis on pharmacological aspects. 2. Analysis of the literature on OCTs makes clear that there is a species- and organ-specific distribution of the different isoforms, which can also be differentially regulated. OCTs are responsible for the excretion and/or distribution of many drugs and also for serious tissue-specific side-effects such as cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these transporters significantly influences the response of patients to medication, as demonstrated for the antidiabetic drug metformin. 3. A substantial amount of research has to be undertaken to clarify further the OCT structure-function relationships specifically to define the role of oligomerization on their activity and regulation, to identify intracellular interaction partners of OCTs, and to characterize their pharmacogenetic aspects.

22497470|t|Importance of Kier-Hall topological indices in the QSAR of anticancer drug design.
22497470|a|An important area of theoretical drug design research is quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) using structural invariants. The impetus for this research trend comes from various directions. Researchers in chemical documentation have searched for a set of invariants which will be more convenient than the adjacency matrix (or connection table) for the storage and comparison of chemical structures. Molecular structure can be looked upon as the representation of the relationship among its various constituents. The term molecular structure represents a set of nonequivalent and probably disjoint concepts. There is no reason to believe that when we discuss diverse topics (e.g. chemical synthesis, reaction rates, spectroscopic transitions, reaction mechanisms, and ab initio calculations) using the notion of molecular structure, the different meanings we attach to the single term molecular structure originate from the same fundamental concept. On the contrary, there is a theoretical and philosophical basis for the non-homogeneity of concepts covered by the term molecular structure. In the context of molecular science, the various concepts of molecular structure (e.g. classical valence bond representations, various chemical graph-theoretic representations, ball and spoke model of a molecule, representation of a molecule by minimum energy conformation, semi symbolic contour map of a molecule, or symbolic representation of chemical species by Hamiltonian operators) are model objects derived through different abstractions of the same chemical reality. In each instance, the equivalence class (concept or model of molecular structure) is generated by selecting certain aspects while ignoring some unique properties of those actual events. This explains the plurality of the concept of molecular structure and their autonomous nature, the word autonomous being used in the same sense that one concept is not logically derived from the other. At the most fundamental level, the structural model of an assembled entity (e.g. a molecule consisting of atoms) may be defined as the pattern of relationship among its parts as distinct from the values associated with them. Constitutional formulae of molecules are graphs where vertices represent the set of atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. The pattern of connectedness of atoms in a molecule is preserved by constitutional graphs. A graph (more correctly a non-directed graph) G = [V, E] consists of a finite non-empty set V of points together with a prescribed set E of unordered pairs of distinct points of V. Thus the mathematical characterization of structures represents structural invariants having successful applications in chemical documentation, characterization of molecular branching, enumeration of molecular constitutional associated with a particular empirical formula, calculation of quantum chemical parameters for the generation of quantitative structure-property-activity correlations. Kier developed a number of structural invariants which are now-a-days called as topological indices with wide range of practical applications for QSAR and drug design. The present paper is restricted to the review of Kier-Hall topological indices for QSAR and anticancer drug design for 2,5-bis(1-aziridinyl) 1,4-benzoquinone (BABQ), pyridopyrimidine, 4-anilinoquinazoline and 2-Phenylindoles compounds utilizing various statistical multivariate regression analyses.

22424816|t|Mechanism of paracetamol-induced hypotension in critically ill patients: a prospective observational cross-over study.
22424816|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism of hypotension following intravenous administration of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to patients on the Intensive Care Unit. DESIGN: Prospective observational cross-over study. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital KrÃ¡lovskÃ© Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic. METHODS: Ventilated critically ill patients monitored by PiCCO and administered intravenous paracetamol at the same time were eligible for the study. We recorded haemodynamic indices, as well as core and peripheral temperatures, continuously for 3 h after the dose of paracetamol. Ranitidine was then used as a control drug known not to influence haemodynamics. RESULTS: We included 6 subjects, and recorded 48 cycles of observations after administration of paracetamol, and 35 cycles after administration of the control drug. Haemodynamic parameters were not different at the baseline and administration of control drug did not result in any change in haemodynamics. After intravenous paracetamol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped by 7% (p<0.001) with a nadir at the 19th minute. In 22 measurement cycles (45%) we noted >15% reduction in MAP with paracetamol. Analysis of these cycles suggests that hypotension with paracetamol can be caused by reduction of both cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance. In febrile cycles paracetamol caused narrowing of the gradient between central and peripheral temperatures suggesting skin vasodilation. These changes were not correlated to a change of systemic vascular resistance at any time point. CONCLUSION: Hypotension with intravenous paracetamol in critically ill patients is caused by a reduction of both cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. We did not demonstrate any relation between haemodynamic changes and antipyretic action of paracetamol. A possibility that cardiac output is reduced with paracetamol might be clinically important.

9457703|t|FK506 and the role of immunophilins in nerve regeneration.
9457703|a|FK506 is a new FDA-approved immunosuppressant used for prevention of allograft rejection in, for example, liver and kidney transplantations. FK506 is inactive by itself and requires binding to an FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), or immunophilin, for activation. In this regard, FK506 is analogous to cyclosporin A, which must bind to its immunophilin (cyclophilin A) to display activity. This FK506-FKBP complex inhibits the activity of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), the basis for the immunosuppressant action of FK506. The discovery that immunophilins are also present in the nervous system introduces a new level of complexity in the regulation of neuronal function. Two important calcineurin targets in brain are the growth-associated protein GAP-43 and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). This review focuses on studies showing that systemic administration of FK506 dose-dependently speeds nerve regeneration and functional recovery in rats following a sciatic-nerve crush injury. The effect appears to result from an increased rate of axonal regeneration. The nerve regenerative property of this class of agents is separate from their immunosuppressant action because FK506-related compounds that bind to FKBP-12 but do not inhibit calcineurin are also able to increase nerve regeneration. Thus, FK506's ability to increase nerve regeneration arises via a calcineurin-independent mechanism (i.e., one not involving an increase in GAP-43 phosphorylation). Possible mechanisms of action are discussed in relation to known actions of FKBPs: the interaction of FKBP-12 with two Ca2+ release-channels (the ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors) which is disrupted by FK506, thereby increasing Ca2+ flux; the type 1 receptor for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 1), which stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis by glial cells, and is a natural ligand for FKBP-12; and the immunophilin FKBP-52/FKBP-59, which has also been identified as a heat-shock protein (HSP-56) and is a component of the nontransformed glucocorticoid receptor. Taken together, studies of FK506 indicate broad functional roles for the immunophilins in the nervous system. Both calcineurin-dependent (e.g., neuroprotection via reduced NO formation) and calcineurin-independent mechanisms (i.e., nerve regeneration) need to be invoked to explain the many different neuronal effects of FK506. This suggests that multiple immunophilins mediate FK506's neuronal effects. Novel, nonimmunosuppressant ligands for FKBPs may represent important new drugs for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders.

10197511|t|Platelet-activating factor mediates ischemia-induced leukocyte-endothelial adherence in newborn pig brain.
10197511|a|The authors examined the involvement of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in mediating leukocyte adherence to brain postcapillary pial venules and altering blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability during basal conditions and during reoxygenation after asphyxia in newborn piglets. Intravital epifluorescence videomicroscopy, closed cranial windows, and labeling of leukocytes with rhodamine 6G allowed us to obtain serial measurements of adherent leukocytes within postcapillary venules. Blood-brain barrier breakdown was determined by optical measures of cortical extravascular fluorescence intensity after intravenous sodium fluorescein. Superfusion of PAF over the cortex induced a dose-dependent increase in leukocyte adherence to cerebral venules and leakage of fluorescein; with 1 micromol/L PAF, the magnitude of adherence and BBB breakdown was similar to that seen during reoxygenation after 9 minutes of asphyxia. Both adherence and loss of BBB integrity resulting from either exogenous PAF or asphyxia-reoxygenation could be significantly attenuated by intravenous administration of WEB 2086, a PAF receptor antagonist. Window superfusion of superoxide dismutase with PAF attenuated PAF-induced increases in adherence and associated fluorescein leakage. These findings indicate that PAF exhibits proinflammatory effects in piglet brain and that PAF contributes to leukocyte adherence and BBB breakdown after cerebral ischemia. These PAF effects are mediated by increases in superoxide radical generation.

8889724|t|Pharmacokinetics of once-a-day netilmicin (6 mg/kg) in neonates.
8889724|a|The pharmacokinetics of once a day netilmicin (6 mg/kg) was studied in 21 neonates. The babies were divided into three groups according to gestational age: group I aged > 36 weeks; group II between 34-36 weeks and group III < 34 weeks. Serum concentrations were variable between patients and the concentration 24 h after the first dose ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 mg/L with only two babies having concentrations of < 1 mg/L while seven had concentrations of > 2 mg/L. There were also large patient-to-patient variations in serum half-life, volume of distribution, area under the curve and relative plasma clearance such that these parameters could not be correlated to gestational age or weight. Absolute plasma clearance was correlated with both gestational age and weight. There was evidence of accumulation between the first and second dose for all three patient groups and for patients of gestational age < 34 weeks (group III) these observations were statistically significant. A netilmicin dosage of 4.5 mg/kg once a day may be more suitable for all neonates supported by assay of serum concentrations.

21228151|t|FoxG1 promotes the survival of postmitotic neurons.
21228151|a|The transcription factor FoxG1 regulates neurogenesis in the embryonic telencephalon as well as a number of other neurodevelopmental processes. While FoxG1 continues to be expressed in neurons postnatally and through adulthood, its role in fully differentiated neurons is not known. The current study demonstrates that FoxG1 promotes the survival of postmitotic neurons. In cerebellar granule neurons primed to undergo apoptosis, FoxG1 expression is reduced. Ectopic expression of FoxG1 blocks neuronal death, whereas suppression of its expression induces death in otherwise healthy neurons. The first 36 residues of FoxG1 are necessary for its survival-promoting effect, while the C-terminal half of the protein is dispensable. Mutation of Asp219, a residue necessary for DNA binding, abrogates survival promotion by FoxG1. Survival promotion is also eliminated by mutation of Thr271, a residue phosphorylated by Akt. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt blocks the survival effects of wild-type FoxG1 but not forms in which Thr271 is replaced with phosphomimetic residues. Treatment of neurons with IGF-1, a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival by activating Akt, prevents the apoptosis-associated downregulation of FoxG1 expression. Moreover, the overexpression of dominant-negative forms of FoxG1 blocks the ability of IGF-1 to maintain neuronal survival suggesting that FoxG1 is a downstream mediator of IGF-1/Akt signaling. Our study identifies a new and important function for FoxG1 in differentiated neurons.

10820150|t|Expression of pancreatic islet MHC class I, insulin, and ICA 512 tyrosine phosphatase in low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice.
10820150|a|Activated immune cells contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus in multiple low-dose streptozotocin-treated mice. However, a role in the process for MHC Class I restricted T-cells remains a matter of debate. In this study, we examined by confocal microscopy the pancreatic expression of MHC Class I protein, insulin, and ICA 512 protein tyrosine phosphatase in C57BL/Ks mice given 40 mg/kg bw streptozotocin IP on 5 consecutive days. All animals were hyperglycemic from Day 7 and onwards. A loss of ICA 512 from the central portions of the islets was noted on Day 3. On Day 7, an increase in MHC Class I expression, confined primarily to immune cells in the exocrine pancreas and the periinsular areas, was detected. Later, several MHC class I/glucagon and some MHC class I/insulin double-positive cells were found. The insulitis was maximal on Day 14 and declined thereafter. The induction of MHC Class I expression in endocrine cells, occuring only after the cellular infiltration and when the animals were diabetic, indicates that the immune component of the disease does not depend on MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T-cells but rather comprises a non-antigen-specific process.

21336140|t|Tacrolimus therapy as an alternative to thiopurines for maintaining remission in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis.
21336140|a|BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy of tacrolimus for inducing remission of refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) is established, its efficacy for maintaining remission of UC has not been evaluated. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tacrolimus compared with thiopurines for maintaining remission in patients with refractory UC. METHODS: Twenty-four UC patients treated with tacrolimus and 34 treated with thiopurines to maintain remission were enrolled as the tacrolimus group and the thiopurine group, respectively. In the tacrolimus group, 82.8% of the patients were treated with tacrolimus for induction of the remission, whereas 70% of the patients in the thiopurine group were induced remission with either corticosteroid or cytapheresis. Proportions of patients who kept steroid-free remission between the tacrolimus and the thiopurine groups were compared. Maintenance of remission using tacrolimus or thiopurines was defined as no need for other therapies other than aminosalicylates without relapse for at least 3 months. Secondarily, to determine whether the response to thiopurines affects the long-term efficacy of tacrolimus maintenance therapy, the overall cumulative relapse-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method was estimated in thiopurine-naive or thiopurine-intolerant patients and thiopurine-refractory ones in the tacrolimus group. RESULTS: Remission was successfully maintained in 17 patients (70.8%) of the tacrolimus group, and 28 patients (82.4%) of the thiopurine group. The overall cumulative relapse-free survival of thiopurine-naive or thiopurine-intolerant patients in the tacrolimus group was similar to that in the thiopurine group, and significantly higher than that of thiopurine-refractory patients in the tacrolimus group. CONCLUSION: Maintenance therapy with tacrolimus for patients with UC could be considered an alternative to thiopurine therapy.

12323401|t|Sequence changes in the human adenovirus type 5 DNA polymerase associated with resistance to the broad spectrum antiviral cidofovir.
12323401|a|Although there is currently no FDA approved antiviral treatment for adenovirus (Ad) infections, the broad spectrum antiviral cidofovir (CDV) has demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against many Ad serotypes in vitro and in an in vivo ocular replication model. The clinical potential of CDV prompted the assessment for the emergence of CDV resistance in Ad5. Serial passage of Ad5 in increasing concentrations of CDV resulted in derivation of four different Ad5 variants with increased resistance to CDV. CDV resistance was demonstrated by ability to replicate viral DNA in infected cells at CDV concentrations that inhibit the parental virus, by ability to form plaques in CDV concentrations of >20 microg/ml and by increased progeny release following infection and growth in media containing CDV. Using marker rescue, the loci for CDV resistance in variant R1 was shown to be mediated by one residue change L741S, one of two mutations within the R1 encoded DNA polymerase. The CDV-resistant variants R4, R5 and R6 also contained mutations in their respective DNA polymerase sequences, but these were different from R1; variant R4 contained two changes (F740I and V180I), whereas both R5 and R6 variants contained the non-conserved mutation A359E. R6 contained additional alterations L554F and V817L. The location of the R1 change is close to a region of the DNA polymerase which is conserved with other polymerases that is predicted to involve nucleotide binding.

18259972|t|Effect of nebulized arformoterol on airway function in COPD: results from two randomized trials.
18259972|a|RATIONALE: Arformoterol, a single isomer long-acting beta(2)-agonist, was developed as an inhalation solution for the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in COPD. METHODS: The pulmonary function efficacy of nebulized arformoterol (15 micro g BID, 25 micro g BID, 50 micro g QD) and salmeterol MDI (42 micro g BID) versus placebo was assessed in 1456 subjects (mean FEV(1) 1.2L, mean predicted 41%). Data were pooled from 2 identical, 12-week, double-blind, randomized trials. The percent change in trough FEV(1), percent change in FEV(1) average AUC((0 - 12 hrs)) and peak percent change FEV(1) from predose were analyzed. RESULTS: Improvement in trough FEV(1) averaged over 12 weeks was greater for arformoterol and salmeterol versus placebo (mean differences from placebo [95% CI] arformoterol-15 micro g BID: 11.4% [8.4, 14.3]; 25 micro g BID: 15.4% [12.2, 18.6]; 50 micro g QD: 10.9% [7.9, 13.9]); salmeterol: (11.6% [8.8, 14.4]). Greater improvements versus placebo occurred after the first dose (mean differences between arformoterol and placebo for trough FEV(1): 13-19%; FEV(1) AUC((0 - 12 hrs)): 19-24%; peak percent change: 20-25%) and at week 12 (trough FEV(1): 10-13%; FEV(1) AUC((0 - 12 hrs)): 6-13%; peak percent change: 7-14%); all 95% CIs excluded zero. Increases in FEV(1) AUC((0 - 12 hrs)) and peak percent change were greater for arformoterol than for salmeterol (95% CIs excluded zero). After 12 weeks, 78-87% of arformoterol subjects had > or = 10% increases in FEV(1) from pre-dose (56% salmeterol, 44% placebo); the median time to response was 3-13 minutes (142 minutes salmeterol). CONCLUSIONS: In these trials, COPD subjects administered nebulized arformoterol demonstrated significant and sustained improvement in lung function over 12 weeks.

10624568|t|Inhibition of beta 2glycoprotein I binding to anionic phospholipids: a strategy for the development of antiphospholipid syndrome-specific drugs.
10624568|a|The binding of beta 2glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) to anionic phospholipids (PL) leads to the presentation of one or more epitopes recognized by autoantibodies from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The inhibition of beta 2GPI binding to PL mixtures coated on polystyrene microtiter wells (MTW) and to large, multilamellar PL vesicles (LMV) was examined. Inhibitors included phosphorylated monosaccharide metabolites, myo-inositol monophosphate (IMP), hexaphosphate (IHP) and hexasulfate (IHS), pyrophosphate (PPi), methyl bisphosphonate (MBP) and phenyl phosphonate, and a series of carboxylic and aromatic sulfonic acids. Inhibitors were incubated with beta 2GPI at 37 degrees C for 2 hr either with dimyristoylphosphatidic acid, 80%/dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline, 20% (DMPA/DMPC) coated on MTW or in a suspension of LMV. Phospholipid-bound beta 2GPI to PA/PC on MTW was detected using an immunoassay based on rabbit anti-beta 2GPI; free beta 2GPI (not bound to LMV) was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. Inhibition was studied over the range 0.01-9.0 mumoles/10(-4)L (0.1-90 mM). Inhibition at maximum concentration in the MTW system ranged from 0.1% (for ADP) to > 94% (for IHP). IHP also provided the greatest inhibition in the LMV system (76%) and was also effective in displacing beta 2GPI already bound to PL surfaces (approximately 50% displaced at 0.25 mM). These data suggest that a strategy for development of therapeutic agents for APS may be based on the use of small cyclic, organic oligoanions such as inositol derivatives to act as ligands for lysine residues at the PL binding site of beta 2GPI.

20645795|t|Tegillarca granosa extract Haishengsu inhibits the expression of P-glycoprotein and induces apoptosis in drug-resistant K562/ADM cells.
20645795|a|This study was designed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanisms of Haishengsu (HSS), a protein extract from a shellfish Tegillarca granosaL., on a drug resistant leukemia cell line. Cultured K562/Adriamycin (ADM) cells were treated with HSS at 10, 20 and 40 microg/mL, respectively. The apoptosis and expression of p-glycoprotein was evaluated by flow cytometry. Expressions of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were also evaluated. There was a significant dose-dependent increase in the apoptosis in the HSS treated K562/ADM cells (P < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). The p-glycoprotein expression in the 40 microg/mL HSS group (14.8%) was lower than in the control (16.9%, P < 0.05) and the 10 microg/mL HSS group (7.3%, P < 0.05), but it was similar to the HSS 20 microg/mL group (10.7%, P > 0.05). The expressions of apoptosis-stimulating protein caspase-3 protein were increased, whereas the expressions of apoptosis-suppressing Bcl-2 were decreased in the HSS groups, as compared with the levels in the control group (P < 0.05). We conclude that HSS induces apoptosis of the Adriamycin-resistant K562/ADM cells. The enhanced expressions in caspase-3 and the reduced expressions in Bcl-2 protein may have contributed to the apoptosis-stimulating effect of HSS. The inhibition of p-glycoprotein suggests that HSS may diminish the resistance to Adriamycin and potentially enhance the therapeutic effects.

10648342|t|Ramosetron for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in women undergoing gynecological surgery.
10648342|a|In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of ramosetron at three different doses (0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg) for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after gynecological surgery. One hundred twenty women, ASA physical status I or II, aged 21-63 yr, received IV either placebo or ramosetron 0.15, 0.3, or 0.6 mg (n = 30 of each) at the completion of surgery. A standard general anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesia were used. A complete response, defined as no PONV and no need for another rescue antiemetic, during 0-3 h after anesthesia occurred in 40%, 47%, 87%, and 90% of patients who had received placebo and ramosetron 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg, respectively. Corresponding results during 3-24 h after anesthesia were 43%, 50%, 87%, and 90%, and 24-48 h after anesthesia were 50%, 53%, 90%, and 93% (P < 0.05). Patients who had received ramosetron 0.3 or 0.6 mg were satisfied compared with those who had received placebo (P < 0.05). There were no serious clinical adverse events caused by the study drug in any of the groups. In conclusion, ramosetron 0.3 mg is an effective antiemetic for preventing PONV during 0-48 h after anesthesia in female patients undergoing gynecological surgery. Increasing the dose to 0.6 mg provided no further benefit. IMPLICATIONS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 120 women found the effective dose of ramosetron for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting after gynecological surgery to be 0.3 mg.

21625062|t|Eliminating exposure to aqueous solvents is necessary for the early detection and ultrastructural elemental analysis of sites of calcium and phosphorus enrichment in mineralizing UMR106-01 osteoblastic cultures.
21625062|a|The mechanism underlying the mineralization of bone is well studied and yet it remains controversial. Inherent difficulties of imaging mineralized tissues and the aqueous solubility of calcium and phosphate, the 2 ions which combine to form bone mineral crystals, limit current analyses of labile diffusible, amorphous, and crystalline intermediates by electron microscopy. To improve the retention of calcium and phosphorus, we developed a pseudo nonaqueous processing approach and used it to characterize biomineralization foci, extracellular sites of hydroxyapatite deposition in osteoblastic cell cultures. Since mineralization of UMR106-01 osteoblasts is temporally synchronized and begins 78 h after plating, we used these cultures to evaluate the effectiveness of our method when applied to cells just prior to the formation of the first mineral crystals. Our approach combines for the first time 3 well-established methods with a fourth one, i.e. dry ultrathin sectioning. Dry ultrathin sectioning with an oscillating diamond knife was used to produce electron spectroscopic images of mineralized biomineralization foci which were high-pressure frozen and freeze substituted. For comparison, cultures were also treated with conventional processing and wet sectioning. The results show that only the use of pseudo nonaqueous processing was able to detect extracellular sites of early calcium and phosphorus enrichment at 76 h, several hours prior to detection of mineral crystals within biomineralization foci.

18847250|t|Potential modes of interaction of 9-aminomethyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene (AMDA) derivatives with the 5-HT2A receptor: a ligand structure-affinity relationship, receptor mutagenesis and receptor modeling investigation.
18847250|a|The effects of 3-position substitution of 9-aminomethyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene (AMDA) on 5-HT 2A receptor affinity were determined and compared to a parallel series of DOB-like 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropanes substituted at the 4-position. The results were interpreted within the context of 5-HT 2A receptor models that suggest that members of the DOB-like series can bind to the receptor in two distinct modes that correlate with the compounds' functional activity. Automated ligand docking and molecular dynamics suggest that all of the AMDA derivatives, the parent of which is a 5-HT 2A antagonist, bind in a fashion analogous to that for the sterically demanding antagonist DOB-like compounds. The failure of the F340 (6.52)L mutation to adversely affect the affinity of AMDA and the 3-bromo derivative is consistent with the proposed modes of orientation. Evaluation of ligand-receptor complex models suggest that a valine/threonine exchange between the 5-HT 2A and D 2 receptors may be the origin of selectivity for AMDA and two substituted derivatives.

22139959|a|The risk for colorectal cancer may be influenced by the dietary intake of various vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids. We conducted a pooled analysis of dietary data collected using food diaries in seven prospective studies in the United Kingdom Dietary Cohort Consortium. Five hundred sixty-five cases of colorectal cancer were matched with 1,951 controls on study centre, age, sex and recruitment date. Dietary intakes of retinol, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, n - 6 fatty acids, n - 3 fatty acids and the ratio of n - 6 to n - 3 fatty acids were estimated and their associations with colorectal cancer examined using conditional logistic regression models, adjusting for exact age, height, weight, energy intake, alcohol intake, fiber intake, smoking, education, social class and physical activity. There were no statistically significant associations between colorectal cancer risk and dietary intake of any of the vitamins, minerals or essential fatty acids examined.

17392695|t|Soy isoflavone intake inhibits bone resorption and stimulates bone formation in menopausal women: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
17392695|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of isoflavone intake on bone resorption and bone formation. METHODS: We identified randomized controlled trials related to urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr, a bone resorption marker) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP, a bone formation marker) listed on MEDLINE (January 1966-April 2006), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE (1985-January 2006), Science Citation Index and PUBMED (updated till April 2006). RESULTS: Nine studies with a total of 432 subjects were selected for meta-analysis. The urinary Dpyr concentration in subjects who consumed isoflavones decreased significantly by -2.08 nmol/mmol (95% confidence interval (CI): -3.82 to -0.34 nmol/mmol) in comparison with that in subjects who did not consume isoflavones. Isoflavone intake vs placebo intake significantly increased serum BAP by 1.48 microg/l (95% CI: 0.22-2.75 mug/l). Decreases in the urinary Dpyr concentration with isoflavone intake of <90 mg/day and with treatment lasting less than 12 weeks were -2.34 nmol/mmol (95% CI: -4.46 to -0.22 nmol/mmol) and -2.03 nmol/mmol (95% CI: -3.20 to -0.85 nmol/mmol), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Isoflavone intervention significantly inhibits bone resorption and stimulates bone formation. These favorable effects occur even if <90 mg/day of isoflavones are consumed or the intervention lasts less than 12 weeks.

11224687|t|Pharmacologic induction of fetal hemoglobin: raising the therapeutic bar in sickle cell disease.
11224687|a|The favorable effects of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) in sickle cell disease have been recognized for several decades. This has been an important incentive for the development of therapeutic agents that increase Hb F production. 5-Azacytidine, the first such agent in clinical use, was proposed based on a molecular understanding of the role of DNA methylation in globin gene regulation. Controversy over the mechanism of Hb F induction by 5-azacytidine led to the identification of hydroxyurea as another agent that can increase Hb F production. Although the clinical benefit of hydroxyurea has been demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial, greater increases in Hb F are clearly needed for optimal therapeutic effect. Butyrates also increase Hb F levels, and their use in combination with hydroxyurea appears to be synergistic. Now that multiple therapeutic agents are available for Hb F induction, the use of combination therapy to increase Hb F levels sufficiently to prevent all the complications of sickle cell disease has become a realistic goal.

23548648|t|Novel targets in the treatment of advanced melanoma: new first-line treatment options.
23548648|a|OBJECTIVE: To discuss the clinical efficacy and safety of ipilimumab, vemurafenib, and investigational agents for the treatment of unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma and define current strategies of first-line treatment selection. DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-November 2012) using the terms melanoma, metastatic melanoma, ipilimumab, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles published in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. Studies and abstracts including more than 10 adult patients were included in the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Treatment options for unresectable stage III and IV melanoma are poor and have remained largely unchanged for the past 40 years. Two randomized Phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated a significant survival benefit with the use of ipilimumab compared to a melanoma vaccine (10.1 vs 6.4 months; p = 0.003) and compared to dacarbazine (11.2 months, 95% CI 9.4-13.6 vs 9.1 months, 95% CI 7.8-10.5). Additionally, long-term follow-up has revealed cases of durable responses of greater than 3 years. Response rates of 50% and greater have been described in vemurafenib-treated patients (1 Phase 1, 1 Phase 2, and 1 Phase 3 randomized trial), although duration of response has not been fully determined. Both new agents possess unique toxicity profiles including immune-related adverse events with ipilimumab and secondary cutaneous cancers reported with vemurafenib use. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment strategies have changed for patients with advanced melanoma with the use of ipilimumab and vemurafenib as first-line agents. Increased clinical experience and further published data with these and investigational agents will guide the development of treatment algorithms outlining optimal drug selection and sequencing as well as improve management of their novel adverse events.

24641358|t|Medical treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis: from bisphosphonates to targeted drugs.
24641358|a|Breast cancer bone metastasis causing severe morbidity is commonly encountered in daily clinical practice. It causes pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord and other nerve compression syndromes and life threatening hypercalcemia. Breast cancer metastasizes to bone through complicated steps in which numerous molecules play roles. Metastatic cells disrupt normal bone turnover and create a vicious cycle to which treatment efforts should be directed. Bisphosphonates have been used safely for more than two decades. As a group they delay time to first skeletal related event and reduce pain, but do not prevent development of bone metastasis in patients with no bone metastasis, and also do not prolong survival. The receptor activator for nuclear factor kB ligand inhibitor denosumab delays time to first skeletal related event and reduces the skeletal morbidity rate. Radionuclides are another treatment option for bone pain. New targeted therapies and radionuclides are still under investigation. In this review we will focus on mechanisms of bone metastasis and its medical treatment in breast cancer patients.

18562808|t|Etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of atrial fibrillation: part 1.
18562808|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a higher incidence of mortality, stroke, and coronary events than is sinus rhythm. AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be given to immediately slow a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nonpharmacologic therapies should be used in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. This is part 1 of a 2-part review of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second part will be published in the subsequent issue of Cardiology in Review.

22626465|t|Astaxanthin attenuates the UVB-induced secretion of prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8 in human keratinocytes by interrupting MSK1 phosphorylation in a ROS depletion-independent manner.
22626465|a|To elucidate the effects of redox balance regulation on cutaneous inflammation, we used the potent antioxidant astaxanthin (AX) to assess its effect on the UVB-induced secretion of PGE(2) and IL-8 in human keratinocytes and analysed its biological mechanism of action. The addition of AX (at 8 µm) to human keratinocytes even after UVB irradiation significantly down-regulated the increased secretion of PGE(2) or IL-8. Those suppressive effects were accompanied by significantly decreased expression of genes encoding COX-2 or IL-8 as well as COX-2 protein. Analysis using a specific NF-kB tanslocation inhibitor demonstrated that the UVB-stimulated secretion of PGE(2) and IL-8 was significantly abolished by its treatment prior to UVB irradiation. Western blotting of phosphorylated signalling molecules revealed that UVB irradiation (80 mJ/cm(2) ) significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK, which was not suppressed by treatment with AX after irradiation. In contrast, AX significantly inhibited the UVB-increased phosphorylation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK)-1, NF-kBp65 or CREB even when treated postirradiation. Further, the MSK1 inhibitor H89 significantly down-regulated the increased secretion of PGE(2) and IL-8 in UVB-exposed human keratinocytes, following post-irradiation treatment. These findings suggests that AX attenuates the auto-phosphorylation of MSK1 required for its activation, which results in the decreased phosphorylation of NF-kBp65, which in turn probably leads to a deficiency of NF-kB DNA binding activity. This may be associated with the significant suppression of PGE(2) /IL-8 secretion via the down-regulated expression of COX-2 and IL-8 at the gene and/or protein levels.

2172175|t|Effect of fructose 1,6-diphosphate on exercise capacity in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
2172175|a|Exogenous fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), a glycolytic intermediate, increases blood ATP and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels, facilitates the dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin, and increases red blood cell flexibility. These mechanisms explain why it has been effective in enhancing energy production in a variety of ischemic conditions. The present study was undertaken to determine whether FDP could enhance oxygen supply and thus improve exercise performance in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ten male patients (mean age 63 +/- 5 years) with peripheral vascular disease performed symptom-limited exercise testing after randomized, double blind infusion of either 200 mg/kg body weight FDP or placebo. Data were evaluated at rest, at a matched submaximal workload (2-3 MPH/0% grade), and at peak exercise, defined as the occurrence of moderately severe claudication. No differences were observed in heart rate, blood pressure, gas exchange data, time to the onset of claudication or peak exercise, or lactate and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels. In contrast to previous studies performed among patients with peripheral vascular disease and other studies using more severe hypoxic conditions, FDP did not affect the respiratory gas exchange or exercise capacity of patients with exertional claudication.

17696710|t|The acute effects of nicotine on positive and negative affect in adolescent smokers.
17696710|a|Although adolescent cigarette smoking remains a critical public health concern, little is known about the reinforcing mechanisms governing smoking in this vulnerable population. To assess predictions derived from both positive and negative reinforcement models of drug use, the authors measured the acute effects of nicotine, as administered via tobacco cigarettes, on both positive and negative affect in a group of 15- to 18-year-old smokers. A matched group of nonsmokers served as a comparison group. Findings revealed that whereas adolescents who smoked a cigarette experienced reductions in both positive and negative affect, the observed reductions in negative affect were moderated by nicotine content of the cigarette (high yield vs. denicotinized), level of nicotine dependence, level of baseline craving, and smoking expectancies pertinent to negative affect regulation. Nonsmokers experienced no change in affect over the 10-min assessment period, and no interaction effects were observed for positive affect. Overall, the findings conform to a negative reinforcement model of nicotine effects and strongly suggest that, even among young light smokers, nicotine dependence and resultant withdrawal symptomatology may serve as motivating factors governing smoking behavior.

24121303|t|Synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of water soluble sulfonate- and ester-functionalized silver(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
24121303|a|The novel N-heterocyclic carbene ligand precursor NaHIm(PrSO3) (sodium 3,3'-(1H-imidazole-3-ium-1,3-diyl)dipropane-1-sulfonate) and the related silver carbene complex [Na4(Im(PrSO3))2]AgCl have been synthesized and characterized. Recrystallization of the analogous [Im(AcEt)]AgCl complex allowed the development of X-ray analysis which led to achieve relevant structural information concerning this silver(I) derivative. Both sulfonate- and ester-functionalized silver(I) N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities in a wide panel of human cancer cells. Complex [Na4(Im(PrSO3))2]AgCl showed a significant in vitro antiproliferative activity that was correlated with its strong ability to inhibit thioredoxin reductase. The inhibition of this selenoenzyme determined an alteration of the cellular redox environment thus leading to the induction of the apoptotic cell death through the activation of the ASK-1 pathway.

1480728|t|Are patients who are intolerant to one SSRI intolerant to another?
1480728|a|One hundred patients with major depression who had discontinued fluoxetine because of side effects were enrolled in a multicenter, open, 8-week study of sertraline. After a washout period of at least 3 weeks following fluoxetine discontinuation and an additional 1-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, patients began treatment with 50 mg sertraline once daily. Based on the clinician's judgment of patient response, doses were titrated upward if necessary. The maximum daily dose of sertraline was 200 mg. Depressive symptoms and adverse events were assessed weekly. An interim analysis was conducted of the first 93 patients who completed the study. Of 91 evaluable patients, 69 sertraline-treated patients (75.8%) experienced significant improvement in depression. Only 8 of 93 patients (8.6%) discontinued sertraline because of side effects.

23617038|t|Glucose monitoring as an impediment to improving glycemic control: a case report.
23617038|a|Diabetes mellitus is increasing in frequency and is associated with disabling acute and chronic complications. There is evidence to indicate that excellent glucose control may retard the development and/or progression of these complications. In order to optimize diabetic control, patients are encouraged to monitor their glucose frequently. We describe a patient who provided inaccurate glucose monitoring results, delaying effective management of hisprogressively increasing glycosylated hemoglobin level. The diagnostic due to his erroneous glucose monitoring results was the lack of intra-day variation in this patient on insulin therapy. Moreover, glucose records within the patient's glucometer pointed to a much less frequent glucose monitoring than the written data provided by the patient. The glucometer was accurate when used by the patient under direct observation. It remains unclear whether this patient deliberately misled his providers or if the erroneous data reflected underlying cognitive dysfunction. Providers are encouraged to approximate average blood sugars based on glycosylated hemoglobin values and compare this to home monitoring results provided by the patient. Primary providers should also expect a certain degree of variability when reviewing home blood sugar values with their patients (on insulin therapy) and consider further investigation should the numbers lack such variation. Clinicians are urged to inspect the actual glucose readings on the patient's glucometer as well as inspecting written glucoserecords. Observing the patient's technique and accuracy when using their personal glucometer should also be considered.

12062494|t|Reduction in the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections after praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis infection.
12062494|a|Praziquantel exhibits activity against all major human schistosome parasites and has become the cornerstone for treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is also active against a wide range of trematodes, human and veterinary cestodes and displays cysticidal effects. To the best of our knowledge anthelminthic properties have never been documented. Here, we report a study among 96 schoolchildren from an area highly endemic for Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infection, and place particular emphasis on the effect of praziquantel on the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections. Stool specimens were screened over several consecutive days prior and 4 weeks after systematic administration of praziquantel. We found a significant reduction in the prevalence of hookworm infection from 75.0 to 40.6% (odds ratio (OR)=0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11-0.40). Infection intensities, expressed by geometric mean egg counts of all children, were also reduced significantly from 10.7 to 2.0 eggs per gram stool (paired t-test=7.78, P<0.001). If these findings are confirmed in other epidemiological settings - following a similarly sensitive diagnostic approach - they might become of considerable relevance. In areas where both schistosome and hookworm coexist, and praziquantel is being recommended for schistosomiasis control, large-scale application of this drug might also reduce the burden of hookworms.

22406476|t|Aspirin inhibits mTOR signaling, activates AMP-activated protein kinase, and induces autophagy in colorectal cancer cells.
22406476|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aspirin reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by unknown mechanisms. Cancer cells have defects in signaling via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates proliferation. We investigated whether aspirin affects adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling in CRC cells. METHODS: The effects of aspirin on mTOR signaling, the ribosomal protein S6, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) were examined in CRC cells by immunoblotting. Phosphorylation of AMPK was measured; the effects of loss of AMPKa on the aspirin-induced effects of mTOR were determined using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in CRC cells and in AMPK(a1/a2-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. LC3 and ULK1 were used as markers of autophagy. We analyzed rectal mucosa samples from patients given 600 mg aspirin, once daily for 1 week. RESULTS: Aspirin reduced mTOR signaling in CRC cells by inhibiting the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Aspirin changed nucleotide ratios and activated AMPK in CRC cells. mTOR was still inhibited by aspirin in CRC cells after siRNA knockdown of AMPKa, indicating AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms of aspirin-induced inhibition of mTOR. Aspirin induced autophagy, a feature of mTOR inhibition. Aspirin and metformin (an activator of AMPK) increased inhibition of mTOR and Akt, as well as autophagy in CRC cells. Rectal mucosal samples from patients given aspirin had reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin is an inhibitor of mTOR and an activator of AMPK, targeting regulators of intracellular energy homeostasis and metabolism. These could contribute to its protective effects against development of CRC.

19468717|t|Monoamine transporter gene polymorphisms affect susceptibility to depression and predict antidepressant response.
19468717|a|RATIONALE: Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) are the primary targets of many antidepressants. We aimed to determine the potential correlations of 5-HTT/NET gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to depression and the antidepressant response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or dual selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). METHODS: A total of 579 depressed patients and 437 healthy controls, all of Chinese Han region, were collected and genotyped by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). All patients were under treatment of SSRI or SNRI for 6 weeks, and were evaluated using a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-seven of 579 patients completed the total treatment, of which 362 were in SSRI and 205 in SNRI group. It was shown that the NET-T182C, interacting with 5-HTTLPR, was associated with the susceptibility to depression. Patients with both NET-T182C C/C and 5-HTTLPR S/S genotypes had lower baseline HAMD scores. Patients with 5-HTTLPR L/L or STin2 12/12 genotype experienced better clinical response to the SSRI treatment. Besides, the STin2 12/12 carriers showed a superior reduction to HAMD scores over treatment period. No correlation between NET T182C/G1287A polymorphisms and antidepressant response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a positive association of the NET-T182C polymorphism with susceptibility to and severity of depression, and a positive association between the 5-HTT polymorphisms and the antidepressant response to SSRI. Combinations of these polymorphisms provided some potential gene-gene interaction effects. These findings might be of some clinical values in optimization of depression treatment.

21258737|t|High cytotoxicity of dihalo-substituted 8-quinolinolato-lanthanides.
21258737|a|Three new lanthanide complexes with dihalo-substituted 8-quinolinol: [Gd(BrQ)(3)(H(2)O)(2)] ·1.33EtOH ·0.33H(2)O (1), [Dy(ClQ)(3)(H(2)O)(2)] ·1.33EtOH ·0.33H(2)O (2), [Er(ClQ)(3)(H(2)O)(2)] ·1.33EtOH ·0.33H(2)O (3) (H-BrQ = 5,7-dibromo-8-quinolinol, H-ClQ = 5,7-dichloro-8-quinolinol) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, ESI-MS, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and TGA. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that complexes 1-3 are mononuclear and isostructural. Each metal centre is coordinated by three dihalo-substituted 8-quinolinol and two aqua ligands. The in vitro cytotoxicity of dihalo-substituted 8-quinolinol and complexes 1-3 against liver cancer BEL7404 was evaluated. The IC(50) values of 1-3 to BEL7404 were 47.2  ± 2.6, 18.3  ± 1.0 and 31.5  ± 1.2 nM, respectively. The lanthanide complexes 1-3 exhibited significantly enhanced cytotoxicity vs. free substituted 8-quinolinol. The binding properties of dihalo-substituted 8-quinolinol and complexes 1 and 2 to DNA were investigated by UV-vis, fluorescence, CD spectroscopy and viscosity measurements, as well as agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. Both complexes 1 and 2 interact more strongly with DNA than the free quinolinol ligand. Intercalation is the most probable binding mode for both the complexes and the quinolinol ligands.

2371028|t|Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens in obstetric patients with acute pyelonephritis.
2371028|a|The purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens in 121 pregnant patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. We obtained urine for culture by catheterization and defined a positive culture as greater than 100 colony-forming units per milliliter of urine. We determined bacterial sensitivities with either the Bauer-Kirby disc diffusion test or the Vitek Auto Microbic System. During the 4 years of the study, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant organisms was 26% (95% confidence interval 18-34%). However, only 4% (95% confidence interval 0-8%) of the uropathogens were resistant to limited-spectrum, first-generation cephalosporins. This observed difference in antibiotic sensitivity was highly significant (P less than .005). Therefore, we conclude that a limited-spectrum cephalosporin is more appropriate than ampicillin for empirical therapy of pyelonephritis in pregnancy.

21102966|t|Comparative effectiveness of a one-year follow-up of thoracic medial branch blocks in management of chronic thoracic pain: a randomized, double-blind active controlled trial.
21102966|a|BACKGROUND: Thoracic facet joints have been implicated as the source of chronic pain in the mid back or upper back in 34% to 42% of patients when the modified criteria of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) is utilized. Various therapeutic techniques utilized in managing chronic thoracic pain of facet joint origin include intraarticular injections, medial branch blocks, and radiofrequency neurotomy of thoracic medial branch nerves. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial. SETTING: A private practice, interventional pain management setting, and a specialty referral center setting in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic local anesthetic medial branch blocks with or without steroid in managing chronic function-limiting mid back or upper back pain of facet joint origin. METHODS: The study was performed in an interventional pain management private practice, a tertiary referral center, in the United States. A total of 100 participants were included, with 50 participants in each of the local anesthetic and steroid groups. All of the participants met the diagnostic criteria of thoracic facet joint pain by means of comparative, controlled diagnostic blocks and the inclusion criteria. Group I participants received thoracic medial branch blocks with bupivacaine, whereas Group II participants received thoracic medial branch blocks with bupivacaine and non-particulate betamethasone. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT: Outcomes measures included numeric rating scores (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), opioid intake, and return to work status at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Significant pain relief was defined as >/= 50% pain relief and/or a positive change in ODI scores. RESULTS: In Group I and Group II 90% of participants showed significant pain relief and functional improvement at 12 months. The majority of the participants experienced significant pain relief of 47.2  ± 10.1 weeks in Group I and 46.3  ± 8.4 weeks in Group II, requiring approximately 3.5 treatments per year with an average relief of 15.8  ± 10.5 in Group I and 13.6  ± 3.6 weeks in Group II per episode of treatment. LIMITATIONS: Study limitations include the lack of a placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic thoracic medial branch blocks, with or without steroid, may provide a management option for chronic function-limiting mid back or upper back pain of facet joint origin. CLINICAL TRIAL: NCT00355706.

15836594|t|Calcineurin inhibitor-induced headache: clinical characteristics and possible mechanisms.
15836594|a|OBJECTIVE: To classify the headache syndromes under treatment with calcineurin inhibitors and to investigate whether the latter influence the nitric oxide production of human brain microvascular cells (HBMEC). BACKGROUND: Single cases of cyclosporine-induced headaches have been reported. Since calcineurin inhibitors are known to influence the renal metabolism of NO, a key molecule in tension-type headache and migraine, we were interested whether calcineurin inhibitors might change NO metabolism in HBMEC as well. DESIGN AND METHODS: Headache symptoms of 74 patients receiving cyclosporine and/or tacrolimus for organ transplantation were retrospectively assessed. Furthermore, the effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on nitric oxide production in human brain microvascular endothelial cells was investigated after incubation. RESULTS: Only 18 of the 74 patients reported no headache 1-36 months after liver, lung, or bone-marrow transplantation, 28 reported a new headache, and 17 an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing headache. The headache was generally classified as migraine without aura (IHS 1.1) or migraine-like headache (IHS 1.6). Furthermore, we found significantly increased NO production after co-incubation of calcineurin inhibitors with human brain microvascular endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiological mechanism of these headaches may be connected with an endothelial dysfunction in terms of increased production of NO.

11984797|t|In vitro drug resistance profile of Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia is heterogeneous and related to age: a report of the Dutch and German Leukemia Study Groups.
11984797|a|BACKGROUND: The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation leading to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome resulting in BCR-ABL gene fusion is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: We studied the relation between t(9;22), determined by karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro drug resistance, measured by the MTT assay, in precursor B-cell ALL at diagnosis. The findings in twenty-one Ph-positive (Ph+) childhood common/precursorB (c/preB) cases were compared with 254 Ph-negative (Ph-) ALL cases. RESULTS: A large range of LC(50) values was found within the Ph+ patients. Moreover, LC(50) values did not differ significantly between Ph+ and Ph- samples for prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, anthracyclines, thiopurines, epipodophyllotoxins, and 4H00-ifosfamide, even after matching for important prognostic features (age, white blood cell count (WBC), and immunophenotype). Adult Ph+ (n = 12) ALL was more resistant to prednisolone (> 270-fold, P = 0.030), and displayed an overall tendency to resistance when compared to matched cases of Ph- (n = 15) adult precursor B-cell ALL. Within Ph+ ALL, in vitro prednisolone resistance increased significantly with age (P = 0.006). The expression of lung resistance protein (LRP), but not P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance protein (MRP), was significantly higher in all Ph+ patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both childhood and adult Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL samples display a heterogeneous in vitro resistance profile, with relatively sensitive and resistant cases. The adult Ph+ samples, however, are generally more resistant compared to matched Ph- controls, reaching significance for prednisolone. The correlation of prednisolone resistance with age within the Ph+ cases might help explain the poorer prognosis of adult Ph+ ALL.

21322776|t|Personalizing treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
21322776|a|Over the past few years, more effective therapies have emerged in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); these are mainly combinations of immunotherapy with fludarabine-based regimens. Despite the higher response rates obtained with these more intensive treatments, they may not always be applicable. Patients with several comorbidities have an increased toxicity with these newer therapies. Effective tools to distinguish between fit and nonfit patients and new therapeutic approaches suitable for fragile patients with CLL are therefore necessary. Moreover, there is still a subset of patients who are refractory to standard fludarabine-based treatments who continue to have very poor survival. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of resistance to treatment in order to develop new therapeutic agents for those patients are mandatory. Finally, advances in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of CLL are promoting the emergence of drugs directed to new biological targets of this disease. Consequently, trials exploring the toxicity profile and efficacy of these new therapeutic agents, alone or in combination with standard treatments, are warranted.

20953224|t|Outcome of patients on azathioprine: a need for a better pre-treatment assessment and dosing guideline.
20953224|a|BACKGROUND: Azathioprine (AZA) is a commonly used drug for the management of various rheumatologic disorders. Due to individual variation of the metabolism of AZA, related to genetic polymorphism of the thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT), serious toxic effects can result if inappropriate dose is administered. AZA dosing according to patients TPMT status can reduce drug-induced morbidity and can be cost effective. AIM: To determine the current local practice of AZA dosing, identify AZA-related toxicity and to compare the local practice with the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) recommendations. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients on AZA for various rheumatologic conditions from inpatient (n=22) and outpatient (n=38) database at Middlemore Hospital, from January 2003 to January 2007. Data were collected on patient's demographics, treatment history including AZA dosing regimen, TPMT testing, drug-related toxicities and their management. RESULTS: The mean age was 53 years; 73% were females. 43% of European ethnicity; mean weight of patient was 75 ±25 kg. 42% had SLE, 22% had rheumatoid arthritis, and 13% had systemic vasculitis. Average initial dose of AZA prescribed was 100 ±37 mg. 45% developed AZA related toxicity. AZA was withdrawn in 35 % of patients due to drug-related side-effects and inefficacy.15% of the patients required dose reduction. TPMT status was tested in 6 (10%) patients; three had low TMPT level, needing dose reduction. BSR recommendation for AZA dosing was followed in 15% cases. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of the studied cohort of rheumatologic patients on AZA had drug-related toxicity resulting in discontinuation of AZA. Our data suggests that better pre-treatment assessment including TPMT testing and the practice of guideline based dosing regimen would reduce the incidence of undue side-effects and discontinuation of such treatment.

17700050|t|Combined brief dynamic therapy and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a pilot study.
17700050|a|BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy of supplemental psychotherapy in the treatment of depression is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the superiority of brief dynamic therapy (BDT) over supportive psychotherapies is not well established. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of BDT added to medication with that of brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP) added to medication in the treatment of major depressive disorder. METHOD: A 12-month randomized clinical trial compared BDT (n = 18) with BSP (n = 17) combined with antidepressants in outpatients with major depressive disorder. Both psychotherapies were added during the first 6 months of the trial; all patients continued to be treated with only pharmacotherapy (paroxetine or citalopram) in the following 6-month continuation phase. Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The data analysis was conducted on two samples: the per-protocol (PP) sample and the observed-cases (OC) sample. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed the study. Although at the end of the combined therapies (T2) no differences emerged between the two treatment approaches, the group of patients treated with BDT showed a further clinical improvement at the end of the study (T3): a significant reduction in symptomatology emerged on the HAM-D (PP sample: F = 75.154, p = 0.03; OC sample: F = 67.149, p = 0.022) and on the CGI total scores (PP sample: F = 78.527, p = 0.016; OC sample: F = 74.104, p = 0.007). The difference in remission rates on the HAM-D (75 vs. 12.5% at T3) is statistically significant favoring BDT. CONCLUSIONS: BDT combined with antidepressants is preferable to supportive psychotherapy combined with medication in the treatment of outpatients with major depression.

16918352|t|Regulation of inflammatory responses by sensory neurons: molecular mechanism(s) and possible therapeutic applications.
16918352|a|Capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons are nociceptive neurons that release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on activation. Since CGRP has potent vasodilatory activity, it has long been considered to be involved in aggravation of inflammation such as tissue hyperemia and edema. However, since ablation of the sensory fibers can result in a marked increase in the severity of inflammation and reperfusion-induced tissue inflammatory responses are enhanced in congenital CGRP-knockout mice, the sensory neurons have been shown to play a role in the maintenance of tissue integrity by regulating local inflammatory responses. We demonstrated in rodents that stimulation of sensory neurons reduces hypertension, stress-induced gastric mucosal injury, reperfusion-induced liver injury, and endotoxin-induced shock responses by attenuating inflammatory responses such as increases in both tissue levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tissue accumulation of neutrophils. Attenuation of inflammatory responses by sensory neuron activation can be explained mainly by CGRP-induced increase in the endothelial production of prostacyclin (PGI(2)). Since inflammatory responses are critically involved in the development of a wide variety of diseases, pharmacological stimulation of sensory neurons might contribute to treatment of various pathologic conditions. In this review, the authors describe molecular mechanism(s) by which sensory neuron activation inhibits TNF production, thereby attenuating inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the authors discuss some clinically useful therapeutic agents that are capable of activating sensory neurons and raise the possibility that pharmacological stimulation of sensory neurons is the new paradigm for future therapeutic strategies.

25269083|t|Development of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides for effective activation of rabbit TLR9 mediated immune responses.
25269083|a|CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) are potent immune stimuli being developed for use as adjuvants in different species. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODN in mammalian cells. The CpG-ODN with 18-24 deoxynucleotides that are in current use for human and mouse cells, however, have low activity with rabbit TLR9. Using a cell-based activation assay, we developed a type of CpG-ODN containing a GACGTT or AACGTT motif in 12 phosphorothioate-modified deoxynucleotides with potent stimulatory activity for rabbit TLR9. The developed CpG-ODN have higher activities than other developed CpG-ODN in eliciting antigen-nonspecific immune responses in rabbit splenocytes. When mixed with an NJ85 peptide derived from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, they had potent activities to boost an antigen-specific T cell activation and antibody production in rabbits. Compared to Freund's adjuvant, the developed CpG-ODN are capable of boosting a potent and less toxic antibody response. The results of this study suggest that both the choice of CpG-motif and its length are important factors for CpG-ODN to effectively activate rabbit TLR9 mediated immune responses.

8585668|t|Comparison of N-acetylcysteine and methylene blue, alone or in combination, for treatment of acetaminophen toxicosis in cats.
8585668|a|Acetaminophen is widely used in human beings for analgesic purposes, but is one of the most frequent causes of poisoning in cats. Acetaminophen-poisoned cats develop methemoglobinemia and sometimes hepatic failure. To determine the benefit of using methylene blue, a treatment for methemoglobinemia, along with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the recommended treatment for acetaminophen-poisoned cats, groups of 3 male and 3 female cats each were given methylene blue NAC, or both after administration of acetaminophen (120 mg/kg of body weight, PO). Male cats seemed more susceptible than female cats to acetaminophen toxicosis, because 3 males died of hepatic failure (2 cats given acetaminophen/methylene blue and 1 given acetaminophen/NAC/methylene blue). Although NAC alone seemed to elicit the best overall response, methylene blue, alone or in combination with NAC, may be useful in female cats.

22108915|t|Effects of oral and transdermal estrogen on IGF1, IGFBP3, IGFBP1, serum lipids, and glucose in patients with hypopituitarism during GH treatment: a randomized study.
22108915|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oral estradiol and transdermal 17b-estradiol on serum concentrations of IGF1 and its binding proteins in women with hypopituitarism. DESIGN: Prospective, comparative study. METHODS: Eleven patients with hypopituitarism were randomly allocated to receive 2mg oral estradiol (n=6) or 50µg/day of transdermal 17b-estradiol (n=5) for 3 months. RESULTS: The oral estrogen group showed a significant reduction in IGF1 levels (mean: 42.7% ±41.4, P=0.046); no difference was observed in the transdermal estrogen group. There was a significant increase in IGFBP1 levels (mean: 170.2% ±230.9, P=0.028) in the oral group, but not in the transdermal group. There was no significant difference within either group in terms of median IGFBP3 levels. In relation to lipid profiles, there was a significant increase in mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the oral group after 3 months of treatment, (27.8 ±9.3, P=0.003). We found no differences in the anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, or the homeostasis model assessment index after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data indicate that different estrogen administration routes can influence IGF1 and IGFBP1 levels. These findings in patients with hypopituitarism have an impact on their response to treatment with GH, since patients receiving oral estrogen require increased GH dosage. These results suggest that oral estrogens may reduce the beneficial effects of GH replacement on fat and protein metabolism, body composition, and quality of life.

8215658|t|Thoracoscopy for the diagnosis of the indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule.
8215658|a|Traditional nonoperative diagnostic approaches to the indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule include bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle biopsy. Although both methods are minimally invasive, the diagnosis of the small, peripheral nodule may remain elusive. Open thoracotomy is often required when these methods fail to obtain a diagnosis. Between January 1991 and June 1992, 242 patients with indeterminate solitary lung nodules underwent thoracoscopic excisional biopsy as the primary diagnostic method. Wedge excisions of the nodules were all performed by thoracoscopic techniques using an endoscopic stapler alone (72%), neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser (18%), or both (10%). A definite diagnosis was obtained in all patients. Two patients required conversion to thoracotomy to locate the nodule (both malignant). A benign diagnosis was obtained in 127 patients (52%) and a malignant diagnosis in 115 (48%). Of the malignant nodules, 51 (44%) were primary lung cancer and 64 (56%) were metastases. All patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer having adequate pulmonary reserve (n = 29) underwent formal open lung resection during the same procedure. There was no mortality, and significant morbidity was limited to atelectasis in 3 patients (1.2%), pneumonia in 2 patients (0.8%), and prolonged air leak more than 7 days in 4 patients (1.6%). Average hospital stay for patients having thoracoscopy only (n = 213) was 2.4 days (range, 1 to 12 days). Thoracoscopy offers a minimally invasive approach for the diagnosis of the indeterminate solitary nodule. It has advantages over traditional diagnostic methods of being virtually 100% sensitive and 100% specific with no mortality and minimal morbidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

8614004|t|Reductase enzyme expression across the National Cancer Institute Tumor cell line panel: correlation with sensitivity to mitomycin C and EO9.
8614004|a|BACKGROUND: Many antitumor drugs require metabolic activation to exert their cytotoxic or cytostatic effects. The so-called bioreductive compounds, whose conversion into active antitumor agents is catalyzed by reductase enzymes, are examples of such drugs. The identification of specific enzymes involved in the activation of these compounds is important in understanding cellular factors that may influence drug antitumor activity. PURPOSE: We measured expression levels of three different reductase enzymes-DT-diaphorase [NAD(P)H (i.e., reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, with or without phosphate): quinone oxidoreductase]; NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase; and NADH (i.e., reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide): cytochrome-b5 reductase- in 69 cell lines (most of the National Cancer Institute [NCI] human tumor cell panel) to see if relationships could be established between the activities of these enzymes and cellular sensitivities to the bioreductive compounds mitomycin C and EO9. METHODS: For all 69 cell lines, the activity of each enzyme was determined using cellular extracts and photometric assays involving the reduction of cytochrome c. Western blot analysis was used to measure the relative amount of DT-diaphorase protein in each extract, and coupled reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions were employed to assess DT-diaphorase and NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a subset of the cell lines. The cytotoxic and/or cytostatic activities of mitomycin C and EO9 toward the cell lines were determined under aerobic conditions. Relationships between enzyme activity levels and drug sensitivities were assessed by use of the COMPARE program and Pearson correlation coefficients. RESULTS: In general, DT-diaphorase activity levels were higher than those observed for the other two reductases across the entire cell line panel. Measured activities for all three enzymes varied among cell lines derived from the same tissue as well as between lines derived from different tissues; however, tissue-specific patterns of expression could be discerned. Differences in the activity levels of individual enzymes appeared to reflect differences in corresponding enzyme protein and/or mRNA levels. A relationship between enzyme activity and chemosensitivities to mitomycin C and EO9 was observed only for DT-diaphorase (Pearson correlation coefficient = .424 [two-sided P<.0005] for mitomycin C and .446 [two-sided P< or = to .0013] for EO9). CONCLUSIONS: Reductase enzyme expression is heterogeneous across human tumor cell lines, and tissue-specific patterns of expression are apparent. DT-diaphorase activity levels correlate with sensitivities to mitomycin C and EO9, supporting a role for this enzyme in the bioactivation of these anticancer compounds. IMPLICATIONS: Comparison of biochemical, molecular biological, and chemosensitivity data obtained from screening a large number of cell lines (e.g., the NCI tumor cell line panel) may facilitate investigation of factors influencing drug antitumor activity. The knowledge gained may be of value in the development of new anticancer agents or in the selection of patients to receive specific therapies.

9306078|t|Sensitivity of Helicobacter pylori to metronidazole.
9306078|a|Gastric antral forceps biopsies taken at gastroscopy were cultured for Helicobacter pylori and tested for anti-microbial sensitivity. Using micro-aerophilic culture, and disc testing or E-testing, there was 98-100% sensitivity to amoxycillin, tetracycline, clarithromycin and erythromycin. However, there was apparent resistance to metronidazole in 19 of 102 samples (19%). When sensitivity by E-testing was performed with preliminary anaerobic culture for 24 h only two of 94 samples (2%) showed resistance. In 37 cultures both micro-aerophilic disc testing and anaerobic then micro-aerophilic E-testing were conducted. Eight cultures showed resistance upon disc testing (MIC > 5 mg/l) but all of these organisms were sensitive on E-testing (MIC 0.003-0.5 mg/l). Metronidazole may be used with confidence in eradication regimes.

21835634|t|Aspirin treatment failure and the risk of recurrent stroke and death among patients with ischemic stroke.
21835634|a|BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of occurrence of ischemic stroke in a patient despite aspirin treatment (aspirin treatment failure) is not known. Our objective was to determine if aspirin treatment failure predicts recurrent ischemic stroke and/or death. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) trial and the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST). Multivariate analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of recurrent stroke and recurrent stroke or death for aspirin treatment failure patients for the duration of available follow-up (3 months for TOAST patients; 12 months for NINDS rt-PA trial patients). RESULTS: The rate of aspirin treatment failure was 40% and 35% among 1275 patients and 624 patients recruited in the TOAST and NINDS rt-PA trials, respectively. The risk of stroke and death at 3 months and 1 year was not higher among patients classified as aspirin treatment failures among the TOAST (OR 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-1.6; P = .7) or NINDS rt-PA trial patients (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-1.3; P = .4), respectively. In subgroup analysis, aspirin treatment failure was not found to be associated with recurrent stroke or with the combined endpoint of stroke and death among categories defined by etiologic subtype, including those with large artery atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a post-hoc analysis of 2 randomized ischemic stroke trials, aspirin treatment failure was not found to be associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke or death.

18567992|t|Neuropathy associated with microtubule inhibitors: diagnosis, incidence, and management.
18567992|a|Microtubule inhibitor (MTI)-based chemotherapies used in the treatment of breast cancer--including vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epothilones--are known to be associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence and severity of neuropathy, most frequently sensory in nature, depend on the agent used, absolute and cumulative drug dose, administration schedule, and presence of comorbidities. Although some first-generation vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, were associated with severe mixed sensory/motor neuropathy, the deficits associated with newer agents in this class (eg, vinflunine) are generally milder and limited to distal sensory signs and symptoms. Among the taxanes, sensory neuropathy is reported more often with administration of paclitaxel and albumin-bound paclitaxel and less frequently with docetaxel. Epothilones, a new class of MTI, may be associated with grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy; however, the neuropathy associated with ixabepilone, a novel epothilone B analog, is generally mild to moderate and reversible to baseline or grade 1 levels. The neuropathy induced by MTI therapy is best managed with dose adjustments and/or treatment delay. This article provides an overview of the incidence, characteristics, and management of MTI-associated neurotoxicities for known vinca alkaloids and taxanes, as well as newer agents, such as vinflunine and ixabepilone.

23533564|t|Curcumin as a potent and selective inhibitor of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1: improving lipid profiles in high-fat-diet-treated rats.
23533564|a|BACKGROUND: 11b-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11b-HSD1) activates glucocorticoid locally in liver and fat tissues to aggravate metabolic syndrome. 11b-HSD1 selective inhibitor can be used to treat metabolic syndrome. Curcumin and its derivatives as selective inhibitors of 11b-HSD1 have not been reported. METHODOLOGY: Curcumin and its 12 derivatives were tested for their potencies of inhibitory effects on human and rat 11b-HSD1 with selectivity against 11b-HSD2. 200 mg/kg curcumin was gavaged to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with high-fat-diet-induced metabolic syndrome for 2 months. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin exhibited inhibitory potency against human and rat 11b-HSD1 in intact cells with IC50 values of 2.29 and 5.79  µM, respectively, with selectivity against 11b-HSD2 (IC50, 14.56 and 11.92  µM). Curcumin was a competitive inhibitor of human and rat 11b-HSD1. Curcumin reduced serum glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein levels in high-fat-diet-induced obese rats. Four curcumin derivatives had much higher potencies for Inhibition of 11b-HSD1. One of them is (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl) penta-1,4-dien-3-one (compound 6), which had IC50 values of 93 and 184 nM for human and rat 11b-HSD1, respectively. Compound 6 did not inhibit human and rat kidney 11b-HSD2 at 100  µM. In conclusion, curcumin is effective for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and four novel curcumin derivatives had high potencies for inhibition of human 11b-HSD1 with selectivity against 11b-HSD2.

23247106|t|Ursolic acid sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
23247106|a|Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly occurring malignancies in men, and because existing treatments are not able to manage this neoplasm adequately, novel approaches are needed. Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has strong antitumor activity via the induction of apoptotic cell death in a wide range of tumor cell types and has negligible toxicity to most normal cells, some prostate carcinoma cells are resistant to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Therefore, combinatorial approaches with TRAIL and different chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL. Here, we investigated the sensitizing effects of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in many plants, on TRAIL-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. We found TRAIL-induced prostate cancer cells apoptosis was significantly enhanced by UA, and that UA induced CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation. This study shows the use of UA as a sensitizer for TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death offers a promising means of enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based prostate cancer treatments.

24336967|t|Long-term clinical and anatomic outcome of birdshot chorioretinopathy.
24336967|a|IMPORTANCE: Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a chronic intraocular inflammatory disease with no uniform method to document long-term disease progression or response to treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term visual, clinical, and anatomic outcomes of patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective evaluation of 46 patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy treated at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, England, was conducted. Medical records for a 19-year period (1993-2012) were reviewed. EXPOSURES: Patients received no treatment, short-term ( <=1 year) treatment including local or systemic corticosteroids, or long-term (>1 year) treatment including systemic corticosteroids and second-line immunosuppressive agents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Details regarding clinical and anatomic outcome, including best-corrected visual acuity, and visual field indices were evaluated. RESULTS: Ninety-two eyes of 46 patients were monitored for a mean (SE) of 57.2   (5.8) months (445 eye-years, 17% follow-up of >= 10 years). Patients maintained a steady best-corrected visual acuity throughout the follow-up period. Some clinical indices correlated with transient worse best-corrected visual acuity, including presence of cataract (P   =   .05), foveal leakage on fluorescein angiography (P   =   .04), and increased central retinal thickness (P   =   .02). Serial visual field studies demonstrated that patients who received only short-term treatment had a worsening of their pattern standard deviation with time (Spearman correlation, 0.57; P   =   .003); for those who received long-term treatment, the pattern standard deviation remained stable (Spearman correlation, -0.24; P   =   .26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that central visual acuity can be maintained long term in patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy. Those who receive long-term immunosuppression appear to maintain better peripheral visual fields compared with patients who receive short-term treatment.

9122273|t|Discrepancy among dissolution rates of commercial tables as a function of the dissolution method. Part 7: Aspirin.
9122273|a|The dissolution rate of fifteen batches of commercial aspirin tablets manufactured by five leading pharmaceutical companies was determined by closed and open dissolution systems. The most consistent results were those obtained by the USP method. Inter-batch as well as inter-brand variations were found to be more evidently detected and evaluated by adopting the USP and beaker methods, respectively. The bioavailability of these products was assessed in human subjects according to a cross-over design system. The following pharmacokinetic parameters for the drug were computed, viz., maximum excretion rate, elimination rate constant, half-life time, area under excretion rate versus time curve and total amount of drug excreted during 24 h following administration of a single oral dose. Based on the values of the correlation coefficient of the in vitro results obtained by different methods with the in vivo results, the beaker method appears to correlate best with the area under excretion rate versus time curve and total amount of drug excreted. Thus, determination of the dissolution rate of aspirin tablets by the beaker method can be considered as a reliable tool for predicting the in vivo performance of the preparation.

8636753|t|Antiatherogenic effects of adjuvant antiestrogens: a randomized trial comparing the effects of tamoxifen and toremifene on plasma lipid levels in postmenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer.
8636753|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a novel antiestrogen, toremifene, has similar antiatherogenic effects as tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer were randomized in a trial that compared the effects of tamoxifen and toremifene on serum lipoproteins. Tamoxifen was given at 20 mg and toremifene at 60 mg orally per day for 3 years. Serum concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, A-II, and B, and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol were measured before and after 12 months of antiestrogen therapy. RESULTS: Both antiestrogens significantly reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol and apo B levels. However, the response of HDL cholesterol to treatments was clearly different between the groups. Toremifene increased the HDL level by 14%, whereas tamoxifen decreased it by 5% (P = .001). As a consequence, both cholesterol-to-HDL and LDL-to-HDL ratios decreased more in the toremifene than tamoxifen group (P = .008 and P = .03, respectively). Toremifene also increased the apo A-I level (P = .00007) and apo A-I-to-A-II ratio (P = .018). Both tamoxifen and toremifene decreased the Lp(a) concentration significantly (change, 34% v 41%). CONCLUSION: These results provide positive evidence that toremifene has antiatherogenic properties with potency to improve all lipoproteins that are associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.

12913059|a|Excess coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality among African Americans remains an important yet unexplained public health problem. We hypothesized that adverse outcome is in part due to intrinsic or acquired abnormalities in coronary endothelial function and vasoreactivity. We compared dose-response curves relating changes in coronary blood flow and epicardial diameter to graded infusions of acetylcholine in 50 African American and 65 white subjects with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and normal coronary arteries. These groups were similar for age, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, and indexed left ventricular mass. The same protocol was conducted in 24 normotensive African American and 56 similar white subjects. We found significant depression in the coronary blood flow dose-response curve relation among African Americans when compared with white subjects with similar LVH (P<0.03). Racial differences were observed at all doses of acetylcholine but were less precisely estimated at the highest dose. The same testing among normotensive subjects revealed similar dose-response curves with no significant effect of race. Qualitatively similar results were found with respect to coronary diameter. Adenosine responses, a measure of endothelium-independent function, were similar after partitioning by LVH. Our study demonstrates that there are racial differences in sensitivity of coronary arteries to acetylcholine-stimulated relaxation among those with LVH. These results provide a mechanism whereby racial differences in coronary vasoreactivity might contribute to adverse coronary heart disease outcome among African Americans, a group in whom LVH is prevalent.

17505984|t|Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and human immunodeficiency virus proteins cause axonal injury in human dorsal root ganglia cultures.
17505984|a|Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) has emerged as the most common complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is associated with neuronal injury in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, especially nucleoside analogs, patients are living longer. Some of the antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection have been associated with neuropathies. The pathogenesis of these neuropathies remains poorly understood. Utilizing a human fetal DRG model of predominantly nociceptive fibers, the authors investigated the effects of HIV gp120 and Tat(1-72), alone or in combination with nucleoside analogs on both morphological and ultra-structural changes in DRG neurons. Nucleoside analogs and HIV proteins both caused a significant decrease in the mean axonal length. However, ddI was the most potent, followed by ddC, d4T, and AZT. Despite the combined exposure to toxic dosages of HIV proteins and nucleoside analogs, there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the amount of axonal retraction, indicating that the proximal and distal axon are differentially regulated. In conclusion, both HIV proteins and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) cause axonal damage by inducing mitochondrial injury and rearrangement of microtubules.

21329798|t|Analysis of nelfinavir-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.
21329798|a|Nelfinavir (Viracept ®) is an HIV protease inhibitor that has been shown to induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress reaction in human cancer cells. Although the presumed drug doses needed for an efficient ER stress reaction and ensuing apoptosis in cancer cells is somewhat higher than those prescribed for HIV-infected persons, nelfinavir represents one of the few clinically applicable ER stress-inducing agents, and is currently being tested in clinical studies on cancer patients. Therefore, this chapter describes how to obtain and use nelfinavir for in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, methods are described that might facilitate the analysis and monitoring of the nelfinavir-induced ER stress response either in cancer cells in cell culture or in cancer tissue biopsies. These methods include various fluorescence-based ER staining techniques and the expression analysis of primary and secondary ER stress markers by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis. Among the several methods presented, the analysis of an unconventional XBP1 splicing, caused by the ER stress sensor IRE1, is shown to present the most sensitive and most specific marker for nelfinavir-induced ER stress. Primers and PCR conditions suitable for XBP1 PCR and splicing analysis are presented. Such a PCR-based XBP1 splicing analysis might not only be suitable to monitor nelfinavir-induced ER stress, but could also be applied in drug screening programs to test for other ER stress-inducing agents with similar activities or synergistic activities with nelfinavir.

16509842|t|Breast-conserving therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: long-term results.
16509842|a|The purpose of this study was to determine patterns of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and local-regional recurrence (LRR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conserving therapy (BCT). A total of 153 breast cancer patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by conservative surgery and radiation therapy between 1980 and 2002. The clinical stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 1997) at diagnosis was IIA in 22%, IIB in 28%, IIIA in 39%, and IIIB in 11%. The prechemotherapy T size distribution was less than 2 cm in 5 patients, 2.1-5 cm in 100 patients, and greater than 5.1 cm in 48 patients. Sixty-seven patients (44%) underwent cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF)-based chemotherapy and 86 (56%) underwent Adriamycin-based chemotherapy. Thirty-seven patients (24%) had a complete pathologic response in the breast. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon (G.F.S.). The surgery was local excision alone in 19 patients, local excision and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in 130 patients, and ALND alone in 4 patients. Eleven patients had positive surgical margins. Rates of LRR-, IBTR-, and distant metastasis (DM)-free survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient and pathologic variables were then analyzed in an attempt to identify predictors of clinical outcome. With a median follow-up period of 55 months (range 6-200 months), eight patients developed LRR, five of which were classified as IBTR. Five- and 10-year actuarial rates of LRR-free, IBTR-free, and DM-free survival were 93% and 88%, 96% and 91%, and 70% and 58%, respectively. Pretreatment and pathologic parameters that positively correlated with IBTR were advanced stage (p = 0.03) and margin positivity (p = 0.04). No other clinical factors were predictive of higher recurrence. BCT results in a low rate of IBTR and LRR in appropriately selected patients. Advanced stage at presentation is associated with increased risk of IBTR, although overall recurrence is low. In selected cases, BCT is safe and an effective alternative to mastectomy.

10786933|t|Cancer chemoprevention by tea polyphenols.
10786933|a|Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages, second only to water. Many experimental researches in laboratory animals demonstrated that tea components had an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis at a number of organ sites. The inhibitory effects of tea against carcinogenesis have been attributed to the biologic activities of the polyphenol fraction in tea. This review summarizes experimental data on chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols in various tumor bioassay systems. Many laboratory studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of green tea polyphenols, especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on carcinogenesis in animals models. The majority of these studies have been conducted in mouse skin tumor models, where tea polyphenols were used either as oral feeding in drinking water or in direct local application. Most studies used 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the tumor promoter and found anticarcinogenic effects caused by green tea polyphenols. Black tea was also found to be effective, although the activity was weaker than that of green tea in some experiments. Other studies showed that black tea polyphenols-theaflavins exhibited stronger anticarcinogenic activity than did EGCG. Caffeine in tea was also important for tea to prevent tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms of the cancer chemopreventive effects of tea polyphenols are not completely understood. They are most likely related to the mechanisms of biochemical actions of tea polyphenols, which include antioxidative activities, modulation of xenobiotic metabolite enzymes and inhibition of tumor promotion. In addition, we have also proposed that tea polyphenols function as cancer chemopreventive agents through modulation of mitotic signal transduction. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this modulation need further investigation.

10205311|t|Use of a mixture of medium-chain triglycerides and longchain triglycerides versus long-chain triglycerides in critically ill surgical patients: a randomized prospective double-blind study.
10205311|a|Twenty critically-ill surgical patients who needed total parenteral nutrition were randomly enrolled in a double-blind study comparing two intravenous fat emulsions: one containing a mixture of 50% medium-chain triglycerides and 50% long-chain triglycerides and another containing 100% longchain triglycerides. The purpose of this study was to investigate metabolic and biochemical differences between both emulsions with special reference to liver enzymes. After a baseline period of 24 h with only glucose and NaCl infusion, the lipid emulsion was added continuously during 24 h over 5 days. The parenteral nutrition was administered in mixture bags containing amino-acids, glucose and lipids together. Two-thirds of the non-protein calories were administered as glucose 40% and one third as either long-chain triglycerides or a mixture of medium-chain triglycerides and long-chain triglycerides. The total amount of non-protein calories received was the measured energy expenditure during the baseline period plus 10% and was fixed during the study. Plasma substrate concentrations, energy expenditure, and nitrogen balance were determined and arterial blood samples were taken. No toxic effects or complications attributable to one of the two emulsions were observed. There was no significant difference in energy expenditure, nitrogen balance, liver function tests, carnitine, transferrin, pre-albumin, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids. The only parameter that showed a different pattern of reaction between the two emulsions was serum bilirubin concentration. In this study no evidence of any advantageous effect of a mixture of medium-chain triglycerides and long-chain triglycerides was seen.

15057007|t|Successful treatment of cutaneous langerhans cell histiocytosis with thalidomide.
15057007|a|Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) represents a group of rare histiocytic syndromes characterized by tissue infiltration with dendritic cells. The management of LCH is difficult as these disorders respond inconsistently to immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Thalidomide (N-phtalimidoglutarimide), initially used as a tranquilizer, has recently been used in the management of several inflammatory skin diseases. We describe the case of a 38-year-old male with mucocutaneous LCH. A treatment course with 6 cycles of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosin (cladribine) was initiated. This was well tolerated but withdrawn after 6 months to prevent secondary malignancy. A partial remission was seen. Subsequently, a treatment course with thalidomide 200 mg daily was started. This therapy resulted in a significant improvement of the mucocutaneous lesions within 4 weeks and complete healing was achieved after 3 months. Treatment was then successfully continued with daily doses of 100 mg to prevent relapse. In conclusion, thalidomide monotherapy represents an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment option that should be considered as first-line therapy for mucocutaneous LCH.

19435899|t|The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584 inhibits aromatase.
19435899|a|Endocrine therapy is well established for the treatment of breast cancer, and antiangiogenic agents are showing considerable promise. Targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways concomitantly may provide enhanced therapeutic benefit in ER-positive breast cancer. Therefore, the effects of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) were investigated using human breast cancer cell lines engineered to express aromatase. As expected in this system, estrogen (E2) or androstenedione induced a proliferative response and increased ER-mediated transcription in ER-positive cell lines expressing aromatase. However, surprisingly, in the presence of androstenedione, PTK/ZK suppressed both the androstenedione-stimulated proliferation and ER-mediated transcription. PTK/ZK alone and in the presence of E2 had no observable effect on proliferation or ER-mediated transcription. These effects result from PTK/ZK having previously unrecognized antiaromatase activity and PTK/ZK being a competitive aromatase inhibitor. Computer-assisted molecular modeling showed that PTK/ZK could potentially bind directly to aromatase. The demonstration that PTK/ZK inhibits aromatase and VEGFR indicates that agents cross-inhibiting two important classes of targets in breast cancer could be developed.

15136056|t|Conjugated linoleic acid and atherosclerosis: no effect on molecular markers of cholesterol homeostasis in THP-1 macrophages.
15136056|a|Macrophage cholesterol homeostasis is a key process involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) regulate the transcription of the genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and thus represent an important therapeutic target in terms of reducing atherosclerosis. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a potent anti-atherogenic dietary fatty acid in animal models of atherosclerosis and is capable of activating PPARs in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study examined whether the anti-atherogenic effects of CLA in vivo could be ascribed to altered cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages and macrophage derived foam cells. Of several genes that regulate cholesterol homeostasis investigated, CLA had most effect on the class B scavenger receptor CD36. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA (c9,t11-CLA) and trans-10,cis-12 CLA (t10,c12-CLA) isomers augmented CD36 mRNA expression (P<0.001). Confocal laser microscopy characterised the three-dimensional expression patterns of CD36 in THP-1 macrophages. Linoleic acid, CLA and the PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone increased discrete cell surface CD36 localisation, with a heterogeneous punctate pattern of expression. In agreement with the observed increases in CD36 mRNA and cell surface expression, intracellular cholesterol concentrations were greater in macrophages exposed to linoleic acid and CLA. Further analysis of cholesterol metabolism showed that CLA had no effect on THP-1 derived foam cell cholesterol efflux to apo AI. Thus, altered cholesterol homeostasis in the macrophage may not explain the anti-atherogenic effects of CLA observed in vivo.

19342176|t|Combination of cell culture and quantitative PCR for screening of drugs against Cryptosporidium parvum.
19342176|a|Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic pathogen causing self-limiting diarrhea in immunocompetent patients. An assay combining cell culture and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is reported here to verify drug efficacy against C. parvum in vitro. The monolayers of Human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) were infected by sporozoites excysted directly on the cells and were incubated with monensin, halofuginone bromide and hexadecylphosphocholine until 45h post infection (p.i.). The genomic DNA was extracted at 3, 27 and 45h p.i. and subjected to qPCR targeting the 70kDa heat shock protein gene to quantify the development of C. parvum. The reliability of the method was validated by testing of monensin and halofuginone bromide, which are well known to be effective in vitro. With the dose dependency monensin and halofuginone showed a maximum inhibition of 98.15% and 98.05% at 0.144 and 25microM, respectively, compared with non-treated controls at the endpoint incubation, confirming previous reports. The reduction of the parasite DNA reproduction over 27h p.i. compared with 3h p.i. was found to be as 97-99% in 0.144microM monensin and 99% in 25microM halofuginone treated cells. The new antileishmanial compound hexadecylphosphocholine (24.5microM, Miltefosine) showed 78-98% inhibition at 45h p.i., however, the reproduction of parasite DNA was reduced to 96-98% over 27h p.i. The method has the potential to easily and reliably assess anticryptosporidial compounds in adequately equipped routine laboratories.

16796808|a|Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a novel Ca(2+) mobilizing second messenger, which is capable of inducing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via activation of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in vascular cells. This signaling nucleotide has also been reported to participate in generation or modulation of intracellular Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) waves or oscillations, Ca(2+)- induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) and spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). With respect to the role of cADPR-mediated signaling in mediation of vascular responses to different stimuli, there is accumulating evidence showing that cADPR is importantly involved in the Ca(2+) response of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and VSMCs to various chemical factors such as vasoactive agonists acetylcholine, oxotremorine, endothelin, and physical stimuli such as stretch, electrical depolarization and sheer stress. This cADPR-RyR-mediated Ca(2+) signaling is now recognized as a fundamental mechanism regulating vascular function. Here we reviewed the literature regarding this cADPR signaling pathway in vascular cells with a major focus on the production of cADPR and its physiological roles in the control of vascular tone and vasomotor response. We also summarized some publish results that unveil the underlying mechanisms mediating the actions of cADPR in vascular cells. Given the importance of Ca(2+) in the regulation of vascular function, the results summarized in this brief review will provide new insights into vascular physiology and circulatory regulation.

9835512|t|Inhibition of human hepatitis B virus replication by AT-61, a phenylpropenamide derivative, alone and in combination with (-)beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine.
9835512|a|AT-61, a member of a novel class of phenylpropenamide derivatives, was found to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in four different human hepatoblastoma cell lines which support the replication of HBV (i.e., HepAD38, HepAD79, 2.2.15, and transiently transfected HepG2 cells). This compound was equally effective at inhibiting both the formation of intracellular immature core particles and the release of extracellular virions, with 50% effective concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 5.7 microM. AT-61 (27 microM) was able to reduce the amount of HBV covalently closed circular DNA found in the nuclei of HepAD38 cells by >99%. AT-61 at concentrations of >27 microM had little effect on the amount of viral RNA found within the cytoplasms of induced HepAD38 cells but reduced the number of immature virions which contained pregenomic RNA by >99%. The potency of AT-61 was not affected by one of the mutations responsible for (-)-beta-L-2', 3'-dideoxy-3' thiacytidine (3TC) resistance in HBV, and AT-61 acted synergistic with 3TC to inhibit HBV replication. AT-61 (81 microM) was not cytotoxic or antiproliferative to several cell lines and had no antiviral effect on woodchuck or duck HBV, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, or Newcastle disease virus. Therefore, we concluded that the antiviral activity of AT-61 is specific for HBV replication and most likely occurs at one of the steps between the synthesis of viral RNA and the packaging of pregenomic RNA into immature core particles.

7904464|t|Human pentachlorophenol poisoning.
7904464|a|Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was, and still is, one of the most frequently used fungicides and pesticides. Its toxicity is due to interference with oxidative phosphorylation. Acute and chronic poisoning may occur by dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion. Chronic poisoning occurs mainly in sawmill workers or people living in log homes treated with PCP-containing wood protecting formulations. Quantitative determination of PCP in urine and serum is useful to detect occupational or subclinical exposure. The clinical features of acute and chronic PCP poisoning can be classified systematically into effects on the skin, metabolism (fever), the haematopoietic tissue, the respiratory system, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Although PCP is not classified as a human carcinogen, some epidemiological observations suggest that exposure to chlorophenols in general and PCP solutions in particular may result in an increased risk for certain malignant disorders such as nasal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. There is concern that contamination of PCP-solutions with products such as chlorodibenzo-p-dioxins is the real cause of this suspected carcinogenicity. No specific antidote exists for the treatment of (acute) PCP poisoning. The basis of the treatment of acute poisoning is intensive supportive care with prevention of dangerous rise in temperature. Use of PCP-based products as indoor wood preservatives poses an unacceptable risk to human health.

8001304|t|A multinational study of the effects of low-dose pravastatin in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin Multinational Study Group for Diabetes.
8001304|a|This multinational, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose pravastatin in 325 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypercholesterolemia [serum total cholesterol concentrations of 5.2-7.8 mmol/l (200 to 300 mg/dl)]. Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia.

17991602|t|Process and contents of telephone consultations between registered nurses and clients with HIV/AIDS in Japan.
17991602|a|Antiviral therapy is essential for HIV/AIDS patients, but many variables impede patients' adherence to therapy. To facilitate adherence, trained registered nurses in Japan provided consultation by phone at the AIDS Clinical Center. This study describes the process and content of this intervention and explores the predictors for length of time of phone consultations. The study was completed over 1 month using a time study, checklist, and medical record inquiry. A total of 175 consultations were described. Mean time was 4.8 +/- 3.8 min, and longer for patients with complications or comorbidity. Although the contents of conversations differed according to the phase of highly active antiretroviral therapy, major identified themes included need for medical consultation, symptom control, provision of information, and active listening. The results are useful for those trying to find ways to use telephone consultation effectively to reinforce adherence.

1772005|t|Etiopathogenesis and prognosis of cerebral ischemia in young adults. A survey of 155 treated patients.
1772005|a|Etiology and long-term prognosis were prospectively investigated in 155 consecutive patients (96 men and 59 women), aged 16 to 45 years, referred to our Neurosurgical Unit with cerebral transient ischemic attacks or infarction during the period 1978-1988. All patients underwent neurological and medical-cardiological evaluation, cerebral computerized tomography scanning, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 123 cases (79%), cerebral angiography in 147 (95%). Atherosclerosis was the leading etiology occurring in 48 patients (31%). A cardioembolic disorder was considered the probable cause of ischemia in 8 cases (5.1%). Further possible etiologies were contraceptive pill assumption (5.8% of the total, but 15.3% within the female group), spontaneous arterial dissection (4.5%), migraine (4%), puerperium (2.6%), cervical trauma (2.6%), and other, more uncommon conditions. Despite extensive evaluation, the cause of cerebral ischemia remained unknown in 40% of cases. All patients received antiplatelet medication and 16 underwent surgery. The long-term outcome at a mean follow-up of 5.8 years was favorable: 91% of subjects resumed their work on a full or part-time basis.

19716841|t|Toxicogenomic analysis of N-nitrosomorpholine induced changes in rat liver: comparison of genomic and proteomic responses and anchoring to histopathological parameters.
19716841|a|A common animal model of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis was used to examine the utility of transcriptomic and proteomic data to identify early biomarkers related to chemically induced carcinogenesis. N-nitrosomorpholine, a frequently used genotoxic model carcinogen, was applied via drinking water at 120 mg/L to male Wistar rats for 7 weeks followed by an exposure-free period of 43 weeks. Seven specimens of each treatment group (untreated control and 120 mg/L N-nitrosomorpholine in drinking water) were sacrificed at nine time points during and after N-nitrosomorpholine treatment. Individual samples from the liver were prepared for histological and toxicogenomic analyses. For histological detection of preneoplastic and neoplastic tissue areas, sections were stained using antibodies against the placental form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-P). Gene and protein expression profiles of liver tissue homogenates were analyzed using RG-U34A Affymetrix rat gene chips and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics, respectively. In order to compare results obtained by histopathology, transcriptomics and proteomics, GST-P-stained liver sections were evaluated morphometrically, which revealed a parallel time course of the area fraction of preneoplastic lesions and gene plus protein expression patterns. On the transcriptional level, an increase of hepatic GST-P expression was detectable as early as 3 weeks after study onset. Comparing deregulated genes and proteins, eight species were identified which showed a corresponding expression profile on both expression levels. Functional analysis suggests that these genes and corresponding proteins may be useful as biomarkers of early hepatocarcinogenesis.

12943974|t|Pyrethroid-impregnated curtains for Chagas' disease control in Venezuela.
12943974|a|The use of insecticide treated materials for the control of Chagas' disease transmission is potentially a cost-effective and sustainable option where vectors are sylvatic. A study was undertaken in two rural Chagas' disease endemic communities (96 households) of Trujillo State, Venezuela. After a baseline study (including a short questionnaire survey, assessment of housing conditions, vector behaviour and preferences in vector protection), 37 households were chosen at random for protection by impregnated or non-impregnated curtains. During the 30-day entomological study vector collection of triatomine bugs were conducted in the early morning. The protective efficacy of curtains was determined by the number of vectors found dead or alive in control and experimental houses. It was found that house infestation of Chagas' disease vectors was high (60% of houses) in spite of good-quality houses due to a re-housing programme. The vectors were sylvatic (mainly Rhodnius robustus) and entered the houses at night. More than half the population (52%) preferred curtains to bednets for Chagas' disease protection. Users of pyrethroid-impregnated curtains were well protected as no living triatomines were found in bedrooms of houses with impregnated curtains compared to houses with non-impregnated curtains where an average of 4/7 vectors were found alive in bedrooms. In houses with impregnated curtains 21/30 triatomines died within 72 h; the triatomines which survived were found exclusively in rooms where no impregnated curtains had been placed. In houses with non-impregnated curtains 20% (6/30) of vectors died, probably due to rough handling. It is concluded that pyrethroid-impregnated curtains represent an important option for the reduction or even elimination of man-vector contact and thus of Chagas' disease transmission in areas where species of small triatomine bugs such as Rhodnius prolixus and R. robustus are the main vectors.

25384024|t|Severe cognitive impairment associated with intrathecal antibodies to the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in a patient with multiple sclerosis.
25384024|a|IMPORTANCE: Some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can either present with or develop severe cognitive impairment during the course of their disease. However, the mechanisms underlying severe cognitive dysfunction in MS are not well understood. OBSERVATIONS: We report on a woman who was diagnosed as having MS at age 33 years and who after giving birth at age 37 years developed cognitive impairment with severe memory dysfunction as the leading symptom. Treatment with different immunotherapies, including cyclophosphamide and natalizumab, did not improve her cognitive deficits, necessitating admission to a nursing home at age 39 years. During a thorough reevaluation at age 43 years, analysis of current and stored cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples demonstrated an intrathecal synthesis of IgG antibodies to the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, that is, the characteristic laboratory finding of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Although the patient initially stabilized under therapy with corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and mitoxantrone, severe cognitive impairment persisted and she eventually died from the sequelae of her disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This report suggests that the occasional occurrence of severe cognitive impairment in patients with MS may, in some cases, be related to a superimposed antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis.

11835697|t|LDL-cholesterol lowering effect of a generic product of simvastatin compared to simvastatin (Zocor) in Thai hypercholesterolemic subjects -- a randomized crossover study, the first report from Thailand.
11835697|a|BACKGROUND: It is commonly agreed that people with a high blood LDL-cholesterol will have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than people with low blood LDL-cholesterol. Due to the increasingly high costs of medication in Thailand, the government has set up several measures to combat the problem. One of such strategies is to promote the utilization of locally manufactured drug products, especially those contained in the National Drug List. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is listed as an essential drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Here, we reported the study on the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of a generic simvastatin product in comparison with the Zocor, in 43 healthy thai volunteers. METHOD: The generic product tested was Eucor, locally manufactured by Greater Pharma Ltd., Part, Thailand, and the reference product was Zocor (Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA). The two products were administered as 10-mg single oral doses in a two-period crossover design. After drug administration, serial blood samples were collected every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. The major parameter monitored in this study was blood LDL-cholesterol. RESULT: After taking the drugs for the first 8 weeks, no statistically significant difference was detected in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Zocor-treated) and the second (Eucor-treated) groups. After crossover and taking drugs for further 8 weeks, a similar result was obtained, i.e., no significant difference in blood LDL-cholesterol between the first (Eucor-treated) and the second (Zocor-treated) groups was observed. Upon completion of the 16-week study, there was also no statistically significant difference in the changes of all tested blood parameters between the two products (randomized block ANOVA, N = 37). Only minor side effects, mainly dizziness and nausea, were observed in both products. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated no significant differences in the therapeutic effect and safety between the generic and original simvastatin products.

9374739|t|Induction of aquaporin 3 by corticosteroid in a human airway epithelial cell line.
9374739|a|Although aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is expressed in many tissues in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and other organs, its physiological significance in the body still remains to be clarified. To determine whether AQP3 expression is regulated by dexamethasone in human airway epithelium, we studied mRNA expression, protein expression, and water permeability of the cell membrane in a human airway epithelial cell line (A549 cells). Expression of AQP3 mRNA and protein was studied by Northern blot analysis and immunoblot analysis, and osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured by a stopped-flow light-scattering method. Expression of AQP3 mRNA and protein was detectable in A549 cells and was stimulated by dexamethasone. Pf in A549 cells after incubation with dexamethasone was approximately 2.5-fold greater than that without dexamethasone. Moreover, this dexamethasone-induced increase in Pf was inhibited after treatment with HgCl2. In conclusion, the present study shows that A549 cells express AQP3 and that dexamethasone upregulates the expression of AQP3 and increases the water permeability of the cell membrane. Dexamethasone-regulated AQP3 expression might be important in certain forms of pulmonary diseases accompanied by airway hypersecretion that are treated by corticosteroid administration.

2083926|t|Famotidine in the management of acid-reflux oesophagitis: a multicentre study.
2083926|a|The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux still presents a considerable problem mostly because of its multifactorial pathogenesis. In this study, we tested the response to treatment with famotidine for 8 weeks in patients with reflux oesophagitis, taking into consideration, however, only cases with pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux of the acidic type. All the patients participating in the multicentre study underwent gastro-oesophageal 24-hr pH-metry. The results show a good response to the H2 antagonist treatment with regards to both symptomatology (improvement/healing in 98% of cases, asymptomatic in 68%) and the endoscopic and histological picture. In fact, endoscopy showed complete remission of the lesions in 60% of cases and an improvement in 21%. The histological picture of oesophagitis improved in 64% of cases, 36% of which were completely healed, with no modifications in the remaining 36%. These data, which are globally better than those reported in the literature, can probably be attributed to the original selection of patients treated by means of prolonged gastro-oesophageal pH-metry, who had exclusively pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux of the acidic type. For these patients the use of the H2 antagonist drug is more appropriate even as monotherapy, than it is for those patients who have combined or isolated alkaline gastrooesophageal reflux.

8393273|t|The impact of dose intensity of standard chemotherapy regimens in extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
8393273|a|Oncologists often attenuate the doses of chemotherapy drugs in published standard regimens to avoid toxicity. The impact on survival of this practice in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is uncertain. We have compared the outcome of 85 patients treated with a program of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine to a group of 37 patients treated with conventional regimens of higher dose intensity. The two groups of patients were shown to be equivalent in terms of staging evaluation, response and survival criteria, and pretreatment prognostic factors. The latter was confirmed by applying a published prognostic algorithm. Complete response rates (38% vs 14%) were significantly better with the higher intensity regimens (p = .003). The median survival (39 vs 26 weeks), 1 year survival (32% vs 12%), and overall survival (p = .002) were superior with the full-dose intensity protocols. Myelotoxicity was also greater with the contemporary treatments. Cox proportional hazards analysis, correcting for pretreatment prognostic variables, confirmed the improved survival with conventional doses of therapy (p = .0055). These results support the concept that full-dose intensity chemotherapy provides survival benefit in patients with extensive stage SCLC.

19148574|t|Clustering and risk factors of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage in two Italian long-term care facilities.
19148574|a|BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a well-recognized agent of health care-associated infections in long-term care facilities, but few data about the circulation of MRSA in this setting in Italy are available. The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors for MRSA carriage in nursing home residents in Vicenza (northeastern Italy). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A point prevalence survey was conducted in two long-term care facilities (subdivided into 15 wards) from 12 June 2006 to 6 July 2006. Anterior nasal swabs were obtained from residents and laboratory screening for MRSA was performed; full antibiotic susceptibility was assessed in MRSA isolates. Macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA was carried out by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). For each subject, demographic data, length of stay, dependency, cognitive function, presence of medical devices, comorbidities, current and previous antibiotic treatment, previous hospital admission and presence of infection were assessed on the day of sample collection. Factors that were found to be significantly associated with MRSA carriage at univariate analysis were introduced into multilevel logistic regression models in order to estimate the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of MRSA colonization, taking into account the clustering of patients within wards. RESULTS: Nasal swabs were obtained in 551 subjects; overall 43 MRSA carriers were detected (7.8%; CI = 5.7-10.4%). The rate of nasal carriers was very similar in the two institutions, and varied from 0% (0/36) to 18% (7/39) between wards. Only two out of 15 wards were found to have no MRSA carriers; overall, three pairs of colonized roommates were detected. Upon multilevel logistic regression, the risk of MRSA carriage was increased in patients with cancer (OR = 6.4; CI = 2.5-16.4), in those that had undergone recent hospitalization (OR = 2.2; CI = 1.0-4.4), and it reached OR = 4.0 (CI = 1.7-9.9) in those with three or more antibiotic treatments in the previous year; about 10% of the variability in MRSA carriage could be attributed to differences between wards. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis permitted the definition of six clusters; two of these comprised 78.6% of the studied isolates and were quite similar, with one being more strongly represented among subjects hospitalized in the previous 12 months. All of the MRSA strains were resistant to ciprofloxacine; nevertheless, the majority were susceptible to most other non-betalactam antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that nursing homes are a significant reservoir for MRSA. Statistical and PFGE analyses indicate a scenario where MRSA seems to be endemic and individual risk factors, namely recent hospitalizations and repeated antibiotic treatments, play a major role in the selection of drug-resistant organisms. Infection control measures should be coordinated among different health care settings, and the appropriate use of antibiotics has emerged as an important issue for improving the quality of care.

17203763|t|Intra-arterial chemotherapy: a safe treatment for elderly patients with locally advanced breast cancer.
17203763|a|The feasibility, toxicity and local response rates of intra-arterial chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and mitomycin in patients over 75 years with locally advanced breast cancer was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were treated by the transfemoral Seldinger technique, with the catheter tip placed into the internal mammary artery. In order to evaluate the vessels perfusing the tumor, blue dye solution was infused before drug administration. The patients received 5-fluorouracil 750 mg/m2, epirubicin 30 mg/m2 and mitomycin 7 mg/m2 by bolus infusion. RESULTS: All patients were evaluated for toxicity and response. Twenty-two cycles were administered. The toxicity was mild and did not influence the patients' quality of life; the compliance was excellent. A response rate of 80% (8 out of 10) was obtained; the median overall survival was 33.5 months; no patient had local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial chemotherapy is an effective and safe treatment for locally advanced breast cancer in the elderly.

15842461|t|Determining patient preferences for improved chemotoxicity during treatment for advanced bladder cancer.
15842461|a|Determining patient preferences for improved chemotoxicity during treatment for advanced bladder cancer Conventional treatment for advanced bladder cancer is methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin plus cisplatin (MVAC), with a median survival of 1 year but significant toxicity. The newer combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) has demonstrated comparable survival and an improved toxicity profile (Von der Maase et al. 2000). At present, the importance to patients of the toxicity of chemotherapy has not been widely studied. An earlier study in bladder cancer indicated that toxicity was an important determinant of treatment preference (Davey et al. 2000). A study of preferences for advanced bladder cancer therapy in the UK was proposed.

22560009|t|What can we expect from the serotonergic side of L-DOPA?
22560009|a|Parkinson's disease has long been associated with neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. The metabolic precursor L-DOPA, administered exogenously to patients, has proven its superiority over other medications. Yet, its effectiveness is altered after long-term use by diverse motor and non-motor symptoms. Knowledge of its mechanism of action would be necessary to better apprehend the side effects, but do we really know where and how it works? The connexion between L-DOPA and the serotonergic system, after a sort of crusade lasting for more than 40 years, has been acknowledged recently. The purpose of this review, mainly based on preclinical data, is to present the pharmacological and biochemical evidence demonstrating that serotonergic neurons are mainly involved in the enhancement of dopamine transmission induced by L-DOPA. We are addressing thereafter the two main expectations coming from this mechanism that are fundamental and clinical. The fundamental part will focus on the conceptual framework imposed by such a mechanism, questioning notably the notion that the benefit of L-DOPA is associated with a restoration of dopamine levels in the caudate-putamen. The clinical part will discuss serotonergic strategies to ameliorate the benefit of L-DOPA treatment in line with past and current clinical trials.

20124969|t|Emerging mutations at virological failure of HAART combinations containing tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine.
20124969|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants at failure of lamivudine (3TC)/tenofovir (TDF)-containing or emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF-containing HAART as a consequence of the different 3TC and FTC intracellular half-lives. DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of 859 patients selected from an Italian HIV resistance database (Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis). METHODS: Patients were selected for analysis if treated with a HAART whose nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone was either 3TC/TDF or FTC/TDF; if they experienced a virological failure after at least 6 months of plasma HIV-RNA undetectability; and if HIV genotypes before treatment and at failure were available. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to detect predictors of resistance mutations emerging at failure. RESULTS: Of 714 patients failing with 3TC/TDF and 145 with FTC/TDF, 35.8 and 21.1% were in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage C, and 8.8 and 15.2% were on first-line HAART, respectively. At multivariate analysis, the emergence of K70R (P = 0.002), M184V (P = 0.031), T215F (P = 0.020) and Y181C (P = 0.005) was significantly more common in 3TC-treated than in FTC-treated patients, with an odds ratio of 4, 1.56, 1.89 and 3.84, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite their close structural similarity, 3TC and FTC are associated with a significantly different rate of drug resistance at treatment failure when combined with TDF in HAART regimens independently of the third drug used.

20628664|t|Leptospirosis.
20628664|a|This article forms part of our travel medicine series for 2010, providing a summary of prevention strategies and vaccination for infections that may be acquired by travellers. The series aims to provide practical strategies to assist general practitioners in giving travel advice, as a synthesis of multiple information sources which must otherwise be consulted. BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the many diseases responsible for undifferentiated febrile illness, especially in the tropical regions or in the returned traveller. It is a disease of global importance, and knowledge in the disease is continually developing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide clinicians with a concise review of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management and prevention of leptospirosis. DISCUSSION: Leptospirosis should be included in the broad differential diagnosis of febrile illness. The clinical manifestations of the disease vary from mild, nonspecific illness through to severe illness resulting in acute renal failure, hepatic failure and pulmonary haemorrhage. Diagnosis is dependant on accurate prediction of the time of infection: culture, polymerase chain reaction and serology may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Management is centred on prompt antibiotic therapy using doxycycline or intravenous penicillin G or intravenous ceftriaxone/cefotaxime. Prevention of leptospirosis revolves around the 'cover-wash-clean up' strategy.

18818921|t|Cisplatin and weekly docetaxel with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.
18818921|a|PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin + weekly divided-dose docetaxel in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 34 patients aged less than 75 years old with locally advanced stage III NSCLC were enrolled. The patients received intravenous infusions of cisplatin (80 mg/m(2); day 1) and docetaxel (20 mg/m(2); days 1, 8, 15), followed by a week's drug-free interval. Standard concurrent thoracic radiotherapy was given for 6 weeks (2 Gy per fraction; total dose, 60 Gy). RESULTS: Over Grade 3 neutropenia, esophagitis and pulmonary toxicities were observed in 23.5, 17.6 and 11.8% of the cases, respectively. One complete response and 20 partial responses were obtained, with an objective response rate of 61.8%. The median survival time was 26.4 months (95% CI 16.9--not reached) and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 76.5 and 41.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin + weekly docetaxel with concurrent radiotherapy is a feasible and effective regimen for locally advanced NSCLC.

23389760|t|A mathematical model for the administration of temozolomide: comparative analysis of conventional and metronomic chemotherapy regimens.
23389760|a|We propose a mathematical model that takes into account a classical maximum tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy regimen (whose primary targets are the tumor cells) as well as a metronomic chemotherapy regimen (whose primary targets are the tumor endothelial cells) for the administration of temozolomide (Temodal( ®)) in order to compare the effectiveness of these two types of protocols. The model is built from 4 natural hypotheses: (H1) without treatment the tumor growth follows a Gompertz model, (H2) endothelial cells are more sensitive to temozolomide than cancer cells, (H3) the anti-angiogenic effect blocks tumor growth, and (H4) endothelial cells are more genetically stable than cancer cells and thus less likely to develop resistance to temozolomide. Then, we compared a conventional MTD regimen of 200 mg/m(2) temozolomide J1-J5 every 28 days with a daily metronomic regimen of 85 mg/m(2)/day for cycles of 42 days. Our mathematical model shows that the metronomic regimen induces tumor regression through anti-angiogenic effects while the MTD regimen fails to do so, due to the emergence of temozolomide resistance in cancer cells. Overall, our model is consistent with clinical observations and provides an interesting tool toward the personalization of anticancer treatments, through optimization of dose and schedule of chemotherapy based on individual patient characteristics.

22237003|t|Incidence of cytomegalovirus UL97 and UL54 amino acid substitutions detected after 100 or 200 days of valganciclovir prophylaxis.
22237003|a|BACKGROUND: The IMPACT study was a randomized, double-blind study comparing 100 to 200 days of VGCV prophylaxis (900 mg once daily) in D+/R- kidney transplant recipients. Although extending the duration of prophylaxis resulted in a significant reduction in confirmed cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (100-day: 36.8% vs 200-day: 16.1%(1)), the consequence of extending the duration of prophylaxis on the development of viral resistance remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether extending valganciclovir prophylaxis from 100 days to 200 days increased the incidence of ganciclovir resistance. STUDY DESIGN: Genotypic analysis of CMV UL97 and UL54 was conducted on virus isolated from patients meeting the predefined resistance analysis criteria (RAC). RESULTS: A greater number of patients met the RAC in the 100 day prophylaxis arm (50/163; 31%) compared to the 200 day prophylaxis arm (22/155; 14%). Sequence data were successfully generated for all 200-day patients and 48/50 100-day patients. Three patients in each treatment arm (100 day: 3/163 (1.8%) vs 200 day: 3/155 (1.9%)) had a single known valganciclovir resistance mutation detected (100 day: UL97 gene: M460V, C592G twice; 200 day: UL97 gene: C603W, M460V and UL54 gene: P522S). Overall, a resistance mutation was more likely to be detected if the patient met the RAC during prophylaxis (5/12 (42%)) compared to post-prophylaxis (1/58 (2%)). All six patients with known ganciclovir resistance mutations cleared the virus; three cleared virus without treatment and three cleared virus following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Extending valganciclovir prophylaxis from 100 days to 200 days did not significantly affect the incidence of ganciclovir resistance.

7996434|t|Influence of cell type upon the desensitization of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor.
7996434|a|Previous studies have suggested that the beta 3 receptor fails to become desensitized following acute agonist exposure. We have determined whether this resistance to desensitization is an intrinsic property of the human beta 3 receptor by examining beta 3 receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in several cell types. Prior exposure to ISO significantly decreased beta 3 receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in SK-N-MC human neuroepithelioma cells, which natively express the beta 3 receptor. ISO pretreatment significantly desensitized the recombinant beta 3 receptor when stably expressed in 293 cells, but not when the receptor was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutant receptors lacking the second exon of the human beta 3 receptor also underwent agonist-induced desensitization when expressed in 293 cells. Additionally, the rat beta 3 receptor, which fails to desensitize in rat adipocytes, underwent agonist-induced desensitization when expressed in 293 cells. Pretreatment with CGP 12177A, a beta 3-selective agonist, also reduced beta 3-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in transfected 293 cells. In contrast, 8-Br-Cyc AMP did not desensitize the beta 3 receptor. Concanavalin A, an inhibitor of receptor sequestration failed to prevent ISO-induced desensitization of the beta 3 receptor. Furthermore, radioligand binding studies showed that ISO pretreatment did not cause a loss of beta 3 receptors from 293 cell membranes. The results of the present study indicate that beta 3 receptor desensitization is dependent upon the cellular background in which this receptor is expressed. Furthermore, the mechanism responsible for beta 3 receptor desensitization does not appear to involve sequestration, cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation or down-regulation of the receptor.

19117987|t|Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activates tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced monocytic differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia cells.
19117987|a|Transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation of genes important for cell growth and differentiation plays a key role in myeloid leukemogenesis. We find that clinically achievable levels of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce monocytic differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation, we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFalpha-responsive promoters to facilitate TNFalpha-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the expression of Dif-2, a TNFalpha target gene, by deacetylating chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factor in response to 5-AZA-dC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFalpha enhances the level of phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation. Our results support the concept of low doses of 5-AZA-dC acting in combination with other agents to target epigenetic changes that drive malignant growth in leukemic cells.

19284468|t|The use of estrogen therapy in women's sexual functioning (CME).
19284468|a|INTRODUCTION: Estrogen is relevant to women's well-being including sexual functioning. Aim. The goal of this Continuing Medical Education article was to provide a comprehensive review of the effect of exogenous estrogen use on women's sexual function. Main Outcome Measures. We present a literature review. METHODS: The medical literature was accurately searched (1990-2008) with regard to estrogen therapy in menopausal women by using several terms related to and including the terms "estrogen" and "sexual function." RESULTS: A review of the studies most useful to guide menopausal practice. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen decline is one of the key factors contributing to sexual functioning during menopausal transition and beyond. Systemic estrogen treatments are associated with significant benefits in some domains of menopausal sexual function, especially when estradiol is delivered transdermally, whereas local estrogens are effective in preventing urogenital aging. Even tibolone, a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator, displays positive effects in postmenopausal women with sexual complaints. However, a tailored approach to the individual woman is always needed.

8835396|a|Sperm motility initiation, capacitation, and hyperactivation are modulated by an interplay of intracellular Ca2+, cAMP, and pH. Mechanisms by which these mediators alter sperm function have not been elucidated but may involve reversible alterations in regulatory protein phosphorylation. Studies were designed 1) to investigate the influence of the protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor calyculin A (CA) on human sperm motility and 2) to characterize the CA-sensitive PP and its endogenous regulators in human and rhesus monkey sperm. CA (50 nM) treatment of human sperm resulted in an increase in percentage motility and an acceleration in mean path velocity. Inhibition of either protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) or protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) could be responsible for this motility stimulation, since both of these phosphatases are sensitive to nanomolar quantities of CA. PP activity in human (n = 4) and rhesus monkey (n = 4) sperm sonicates was measured using [32P]-phosphorylase-a, the preferred substrate for PP1 and PP2A, in the absence of divalent cations. Human (6.2 +/- 4.5 x 10(-2) mU/10(6) sperm) and monkey (4.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(-2) mU/10(6) sperm) sonicates contained activity tentatively identified as PP1 on the basis of inhibition profiles in okadaic acid (OA) and CA. Western blot analysis with antibodies against various isoforms of PP1 subsequently documented the presence of PP1 gamma 2 in human and monkey sperm. PP1 activity in most tissues is regulated by the heat-stable inhibitors I1 or I2. Sperm sonicates contained inhibitor activity similar to I2 as well as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, which is involved in the activation of the PP1-I2 complex. These results indicate, for the first time, that human and rhesus monkey sperm contain PP1 and regulators of PP1 and that inhibition of PP1 activity by CA can enhance motility.

11874086|t|The role of chemotherapy in malignant mixed mullerian tumors of the female genital tract.
11874086|a|Thirteen patients with malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the female genital tract, treated and followed in our clinic from 1989 to 1999 were retrospectively evaluated. Seven patients (53.8%) with advanced disease or postoperative residual tumor were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. The median age at diagnosis was 64 years (range: 26-79). All patients underwent primary surgical cytoreduction. Tumors were localized to the endometrium in five (62.5%), to the ovaries in two (25%) and to the fallopian tube in one (12.5%) patient. One patient with endometrial carcinosarcoma had a simultaneous second primary ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Two patients (25%) had a heterologous sarcomatous component. Myometrial involvement included less than half the thickness in one patient, while there was no myometrial invasion encountered in two patients. Five patients (38.5%) had more than 50% of the myometrium invaded. Two patients received additional radiotherapy. Six patients received cisplatinum-based chemotherapy (4 had doxorubicin including combinations), while one patient was treated with a doxorubicin+ifosphamide combination. Five patients (71.4%) had a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. Response duration in patients with a CR was +13, +67, +10, +14 and +2 months, respectively. After a median follow-up period of 20 months (3-115 months), six patients have died, five are being followed-up with no evidence of disease, one is alive with metastatic disease and one patient is under treatment. Malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the female genital tract is highly responsive to multimodality treatment strategies. Further prospective studies are required to identify distinct prognostic groups that may benefit from various treatment modalities.

9387112|t|Indoxyl sulfate and progression of renal failure: effects of a low-protein diet and oral sorbent on indoxyl sulfate production in uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients.
9387112|a|We have previously demonstrated that indoxyl sulfate is a stimulating factor for the progression of glomerular sclerosis in uremic rats. In this study we determined if a low-protein diet or oral sorbent (AST-120) could reduce the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 5/6-nephrectomized uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients. The uremic rats were treated by fasting or AST-120 for 2 days. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate dramatically decreased 1-2 days after fasting or AST-120 treatment. We then measured the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate and calculated protein intake from urinary amounts of urea nitrogen using Maroni's equation in 80 undialyzed uremic patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min. The serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate were significantly lower in the patients on a low-protein diet than in those in the normal-protein diet group. Administration of AST-120 significantly decreased serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate in 22 undialyzed uremic patients. In conclusion, a low-protein diet or AST-120 reduced the serum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate, a stimulating factor for glomerular sclerosis, in both uremic rats and undialyzed uremic patients.

22542753|t|Co-cultures of enterocytes and hepatocytes for retinoid transport and metabolism.
22542753|a|Dietary retinoid bioavailability involves the interplay of the intestine (transport and metabolism) and the liver (secondary metabolism). To reproduce these processes in vitro, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells were co-cultured with two hepatocyte cell lines. Murine 3A cells and the more highly differentiated human HepaRG hepatocytes were both shown to respond to b-carotene (BC) and retinol (ROH) treatment by secreting Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4). In co-culture experiments, Caco-2/TC7 were differentiated on filter inserts and transferred for the time of the experiment to culture wells containing confluent 3A or differentiated HepaRG cells. Functionality of the co-cultures was assayed using as endpoints the retinol-dependent secretion of RBP4 and the retinoic acid-dependent induction of CYP26A1 in hepatocytes. BC and ROH added to intestinal Caco-2/TC7 induced a reduction in intracellular RBP4 levels in the underlying hepatocytes and its secretion into the medium. HepaRG hepatocytes were also shown to up-regulate the expression of CYP26A1 mRNA in response to retinoid treatment. This in vitro model represents a useful tool to analyze the absorption and metabolism of retinoids and could be further developed to investigate other dietary compounds and molecules of pharmacological interest.

8896401|t|Synergistic effects of thrombopoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on neutrophil recovery in myelosuppressed mice.
8896401|a|Severe suppression of the hematopoietic system is a major factor in limiting chemotherapy dose escalation. To determine whether a combination of human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO) would alter recovery of platelets, red blood cells (RBCs), or neutrophils after myeloablative therapy, myelosuppressed mice were treated with sc injections of TPO (90 micrograms/kg), G-CSF (250 micrograms/kg). TPO plus G-CSF or vehicle and complete blood counts were measured. Marrow and spleen cells were obtained at various times and assayed for erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic progenitors. The prolonged neutropenia in vehicle controls (14 days) was significantly shortened in mice treated with G-CSF or TPO for 14 days. The combination of TPO plus G-CSF further reduced the duration of neutropenia. TPO and TPO plus G-CSF treatments also significantly shortened thrombocytopenia compared to vehicle. Recovery of RBCs was also enhanced in mice treated with either G-CSF or TPO, or the combination. Furthermore, treatment with G-CSF and/or TPO hastened myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte progenitor recovery compared to vehicle controls. These results show that the combination of TPO plus G-CSF acts synergistically to accelerate neutrophil recovery in myelosuppressed mice and does not compromise the platelet or RBC response to TPO therapy.

9878981|t|Gianotti-Crosti syndrome: clinical, serologic, and therapeutic data from nine children.
9878981|a|Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS), a self-limiting papulovesicular acrodermatitis often associated with underlying viral infection, is mainly described in children. Nine children with GCS were evaluated with dermatologic examination and serologic tests for viral infections. Therapy was modified according to the subjective symptoms of patients, which included characteristic acrolocated papulovesicles, generalized skin eruption, and mild to severe pruritus. Results of serologic investigations revealed Epstein-Barr virus, Coxsackie A virus, parvovirus B19, and parainfluenza virus 1/2. In three children no underlying viral infection was found. Therapeutic interventions included topical clioquinol lotion 1 percent, topical application of corticosteroids, systemic antihistaminic therapy, and systemic methylprednisolone. Skin lesions resolved after 2 to 4 weeks in treated as well as in nontreated children. Although GCS in children often lacks close association with a causative viral infection, such severe infections as hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus must be considered. Whole-body involvement seems to correlate with severe pruritus and additional general symptoms requiring more intensive therapy.

7630245|t|Maximum androgen blockade in advanced prostate cancer: an overview of 22 randomised trials with 3283 deaths in 5710 patients. Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group.
7630245|a|A systematic overview, or meta-analysis, of the randomised evidence on maximum androgen blockade (MAB) in advanced prostate cancer identified 25 trials that compared conventional castration (surgical or medical) versus MAB (castration plus prolonged use of an antiandrogen such as flutamide, cyproterone acetate, or nilutamide). Individual patient data were obtained from 22 of the trials. Median follow-up was 40 months, during which 57% of patients died (3283/5710). Crude mortality rates were 58% for castration alone and 56% for MAB. Life-table estimates of the corresponding 5-year survival rates were 22.8% and 26.2%, representing a non-significant improvement of 3.5% (95% CI 0-7%). Logrank time-to-death analyses found no significant heterogeneity between trials (or between the effects of different types of MAB) and no significant evidence of additional benefit in an overview of all these MAB trial results (2p > 0.1). The currently available evidence from randomised trials does not show that MAB results in longer survival than conventional castration.

14656059|t|Bayesian two-compartment and classic single-compartment minimal models: comparison on insulin modified IVGTT and effect of experiment reduction.
14656059|a|Models describing plasma glucose and insulin concentration of an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) allow a noninvasive cost-effective approach to estimate important indexes characterizing the efficiency of glucose-insulin control system, i.e., glucose effectiveness (S(G)) and insulin sensitivity (S(I)). To overcome some limitations of the classic single compartment minimal model (1CMM) of glucose kinetics , a two-compartment Bayesian minimal model (2CBMM) has been recently proposed for the standard IVGTT. This study aims to assess 2CBMM ability to describe the insulin-modified IVGTT (IM-IVGTT) which is the protocol of choice since it allows to study insulinopenic states. Both a full-length IM-IVGTT (240 min) as well as a reduced version (90 min) of it are studied. Results of the maximum a posteriori identification of IM-IVGTT (240 min) in 13 normals agree with those of standard IVGTT, i.e., a 42% decrease (P < 0.002) of S(G) and a 13% increase (P < 0.006) of S(I) with respect to ICMM. When identified from IM-IVGTT (90 min), 2CBMM not only provides S(G) and S(I) estimates 46% lower (P < 0.002) and 41% higher (P < 0.002) than 1CMM ones respectively, but also seems to overcome some limitations of the 240 min-based identification that probably arise because the minimal model is unable to properly account for the hyperglycemic hormonal response taking place in the second half of IM-IVGTT.

16105478|t|Evidence-based management of peripheral vascular disease.
16105478|a|Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is very prevalent in the United States and is part of a global vascular problem. PVD patients have a heightened inflammatory state and are at high risk of death from acute cardiovascular problems rather than from progression of PVD. Modifiable risk factors for PVD include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. Symptomatic treatment of claudication includes smoking cessation, exercise, cilostazol, statins, and revascularization with percutaneous or surgical therapy. Antithrombotic therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel is important to reduce cardiovascular events but does not affect symptoms of claudication. Patients with rest limb ischemia or ulceration should be revascularized to minimize the chance of limb loss. Percutaneous revascularization is not without significant complications, however, and future research needs to focus on inflammation, thrombosis, and restenosis in the PVD patient. Finally, new devices that tackle difficult lesions, drug-eluting stents, and pharmacologic agents that reduce global atherosclerosis are on the horizon and are likely to become critical components in the management of the PVD patient.

24174623|t|Estimation of serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations in the New Zealand adult population within a background of voluntary folic acid fortification.
24174623|a|National data on the blood folate status of New Zealand adults is lacking. The objective of this study was to describe the blood folate status and examine the predictors of blood folate status in a national sample of adults from New Zealand, a country with voluntary folic acid fortification. The 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey was a nationwide multistage systematic random cross-sectional survey. Serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were measured by microbiologic assay. The survey included 4721 participants aged >= 15 y, 3359 of whom provided a nonfasting blood sample. Biochemical folate status was measured in 3277 participants. The median serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were 23 and 809 nmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency, defined as plasma folate <6.8 nmol/L or erythrocyte folate <305 nmol/L, was 2%. Having breakfast daily compared with never eating breakfast was associated with 53% higher serum and 25% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations; consumers of fortified yeast extract spread had 17% higher serum and 14% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations than nonconsumers; daily users of folate-containing supplements compared with nonusers had 48% higher serum and 28% higher erythrocyte folate concentrations. The prevalence of biochemical folate deficiency in New Zealand adults is low. Participants who ate breakfast more frequently, consumed folate-fortified yeast, or used a daily folate supplement had higher blood folate concentrations.

8256085|t|Demonstration of bilateral cholinergic secretory response after unilateral nasal cold, dry air challenge.
8256085|a|Cold, dry air (CDA) causes rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion in some individuals. This response can be mimicked in the laboratory by exposing susceptible individuals to cold, dry air nasal breathing. One of the characteristics of this response is that nasal secretions are produced by both nostrils after a unilateral challenge. This study evaluated the role of cholinergic innervation on the ipsi- and contralateral responses to unilateral CDA challenge. Twelve individuals participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study where local atropine and placebo were alternated ipsilateral and the contralateral to the CDA challenge. The reproducibility of the model, assessed by the response after pre-treating with placebo, was excellent; after placebo, the ipsilateral response was double the size of the contralateral. Regardless of the site of application, atropine significantly reduced the secretory response to CDA by 60-70%. However, significant secretions were still induced by CDA, even after atropine treatment. We conclude that cholinergically-mediated neuronal pathways play a major role in the nasal secretory response to CDA. Additional neuronal pathways may, however, be involved. This method is a tool to understand the different components of the mucosal response to a cold and dry environment.

11389853|t|Pin1 acts catalytically to promote a conformational change in Cdc25.
11389853|a|Pin1 is an essential protein that can peptidyl-prolyl-isomerize small phosphopeptides. It has been suggested that Pin1 regulates entry into mitosis by catalyzing the cis/trans-isomerization of prolines on critical protein substrates in response to phosphorylation. We show that Pin1 catalytically generates a conformational change on the mitotic phosphatase Cdc25, as assayed by limited protease digestion, differential reactivity to a phosphoserine-proline-directed monoclonal antibody (MPM-2), and by changes in Cdc25 enzymatic activity. Pin1 catalytically modifies the conformation of Cdc25 at stoichiometries less than 0.0005, and mutants of Pin1 in the prolyl isomerase domain are not active. We suggest that, although difficult to detect, phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes mediated by prolyl isomerization may play an important regulatory role in the cell cycle.

16362770|t|Effects on cholinergic markers in rat brain and blood after short and prolonged administration of donepezil.
16362770|a|Donepezil is a selective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) clinically used for treating Alzheimer's disease. Cholinergic effects after short-term exposure of donepezil (up to 12 h) have been extensively studied in rats, but few have addressed the potential long-term effects. After 14 days administration (1x3 mg/kg, decapitation 4 h after the last injection) the cerebral acetylcholine level was increased by 35% and the AChE activity was decreased by 66% and 32% in brain and blood, respectively. No change was detected in choline acetyltransferase activity, or the levels of vesicular acetylcholine transporter, choline transporter, or muscarinic receptors. Expression of various cholinergic genes was unaffected. Preliminary results of AChE activity in human blood showed 60-97% and 43-89% of pre-exposed level after one and three days of donepezil administration (5 mg daily), respectively. In conclusion, donepezil exposure in rats at doses that do not inhibit brain AChE continuously during the day, will not lead to tolerance development.

1485174|t|Current studies of ifosfamide for pediatric solid tumors and leukemia in the United States.
1485174|a|This paper reviews current approaches to the use of ifosfamide/mesna alone or in combination with other agents or modalities in the treatment of pediatric malignancies. Included are data from current or recently completed studies conducted by major pediatric oncology cooperative groups and large individual oncology centers for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent tumors. Sarcomas, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, recurrent solid tumors, brain tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are discussed. Randomized trials to determine the relative efficacy of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide in various childhood malignancies are under way. The long-term consequences of ifosfamide in survivors of childhood cancer, in terms of development of bladder cancer or other malignancies thought to be associated with alkylating agents, are not known, and will only be determined through follow-up studies of adult survivors. Ifosfamide's future role in pediatric oncology will depend on evaluation of its therapeutic benefits against long-term toxicity.

12151740|t|An immunosuppressive effect by synthetic sulfonolipids deduced from sulfonoquinovosyl diacylglycerols of sea urchin.
12151740|a|BACKGROUND: It is important to develop new immunosuppressive agents without clinical drawbacks. In this article, we reveal the possibility of a chemically synthetic sulfonolipid that acts as a novel immunosuppressive drug. METHODS: We evaluated the immunosuppressive effect of 3-O-(6-deoxy-6-sulfono-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1,2-di-O-acylglycerol (beta-SQDG) that contains a saturated C18 fatty acid, which is designated as beta-SQDG(18:0) by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and rat allogeneic skin graft. Then, we investigated the mechanism of immunosuppressive effect of beta-SQDG(18:0). RESULTS: beta-SQDG(18:0) inhibited human MLR in a dose-dependent manner without overt cytotoxic effect and prolonged rat skin allograft rejection in vivo. beta-SQDG(18:0) did not inhibit the direct activation of responder T. This reagent could not affect the expression of either major histocompatibility antigen complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules on the cell surface of the stimulator cells, antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, beta-SQDG(18:0) was demonstrated to inhibit the binding among allogeneic lymphocytes. However, the expression of known cell surface accessory and adhesion molecules, such as CD4, CD28, leukocyte function-associated antigen 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and CTLA-4, was not affected by beta-SQDG(18:0) treatment. CONCLUSIONS: beta-SQDG(18:0) might be a new class of the immunosuppressive reagent, and the inhibition of responder T-lymphocyte activation in MLR by beta-SQDG(18:0) may be responsible for certain three-dimensional structures of this reagent or its quinovose binding to sulfonic acid.

22123632|t|Vitamin D: role in pregnancy and early childhood.
22123632|a|Several studies in pregnant women and early childhood suggest that vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <50 nmol/l) is common in both population groups. Recent recommendations have therefore reviewed the literature regarding the role of vitamin D in pregnant women and in early childhood. The Institute of Medicine, in their most recent assessment in 2010, recommended 600 IU per day in pregnant and lactating women. In 2011, the US Endocrine Task Force on Vitamin D commented that 600 IU per day may not be sufficient to correct vitamin D deficiency in pregnant and lactating women. Their recommendation was 1,500-2,000 IU vitamin D per day in pregnant and lactating women with vitamin D deficiency. For infants, the recommendation from both societies is consistently 400 IU vitamin D per day, and also in children both societies recommend 600 IU vitamin D per day. This review will summarize the scientific basis that led to the most recent recommendations.

11137572|t|Interleukin 10 aggravates experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis through inducing Th2 and B cell responses to AChR.
11137572|a|The damage of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at neuromuscular junctions of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), an animal model of human MG, is mediated by B cells which require T cell help. The Th2 associated cytokine IL-10 suppresses production of cytokines released by Th1 cells and is considered for treatment of human autoimmune diseases. To evaluate the role of IL-10 in EAMG, rhIL-10 was administered daily to Lewis rats by the subcutaneous route starting at the day of immunization and continued for 7 weeks. IL-10 failed to abrogate EAMG at low dose (0.1 or 1 microg/day) and at the dose of 3 microg/day caused earlier onset and aggravated clinical signs of EAMG when compared to EAMG rats injected with PBS only. Although Th1 responses reflected by AChR-induced lymphocyte proliferation and levels of IFN-gamma secreting cells, as well as AChR-induced Th1 cytokine mRNA expression was suppressed, augmented IL-4 mRNA expression and AChR-specific B cell responses may play an important role in the failure of IL-10 to abrogate EAMG. This study implicates a critical precaution in planning immunotherapy of IL-10 in antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, e.g. MG.

7551881|t|An open, in-patient incremental safety and efficacy study of desmopressin in women with multiple sclerosis and nocturia.
7551881|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety and efficacy of desmopressin in three doses given to women with multiple sclerosis to treat nocturia with or without enuresis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight women with clinically confirmed multiple sclerosis and nocturia with or without enuresis were entered as in-patients into an open, nonrandomized, placebo-controlled study of incremental doses of 20, 40 and 60 micrograms desmopressin. Urinary and serum sodium, plasma arginine vasopressin and urine osmolality were monitored every 4 h for 24 h. A single dose of placebo or desmopressin was given during each of four 24-h periods. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in nocturnal urinary volumes and a significant increase in nocturnal urinary osmolalities in patients taking desmopressin when compared with those taking a placebo, but there was no difference among the desmopressin doses. There was no significant difference in serum sodium level between the desmopressin doses. However, at the end of the 24-h period with the 60 micrograms dose, serum sodium was decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Neither a significant decrease in nocturnal urinary volumes nor an increase in urinary osmolality was achieved by doses of desmopressin > 20 micrograms. A dose of 60 g was associated with a decreased serum sodium level at the end of the 24-h period but there was no biochemical hyponatraemia. Because there were no benefits and a possibility of clinical hyponatraemia with higher doses, doses of > 20 micrograms desmopressin cannot be recommended.

17332362|t|New soft alkylating agents with enhanced cytotoxicity against cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutics and hypoxia.
17332362|a|Chloroethylureas (CEU) are soft alkylating agents that covalently bind to beta-tubulin (betaTAC) and affect microtubule polymerization dynamics. Herein, we report the identification of a CEU subset and its corresponding oxazolines, which induce cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, and microtubule disruption without alkylating beta-tubulin (N-betaTAC). Both betaTAC and N-betaTAC trigger the collapse of mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and modulate reactive oxygen species levels, following activation of intrinsic caspase-8 and caspase-9. Experiments using human fibrosarcoma HT1080 respiratory-deficient cells (rho(0)) and uncoupler of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) showed that betaTAC and N-betaTAC impaired the MRC. rho(0) cells displayed an increased sensitivity toward N-betaTAC as compared with rho(+) cells but, in contrast, were resistant to betaTAC or classic chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel. Oxazoline-195 (OXA-195), an N-betaTAC derivative, triggered massive swelling of isolated mitochondria. This effect was insensitive to cyclosporin A and to Bcl-2 addition. In contrast, adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) antagonists, bongkrekic acid or atractyloside, diminished swelling induced by OXA-195. The antiproliferative activities of the N-betaTACs CEU-025 and OXA-152 were markedly decreased in the presence of atractyloside. Conversely, pretreatment with cyclosporin A enhanced growth inhibition induced by betaTAC and N-betaTAC. One of the proteins alkylated by N-betaTAC was identified as the voltage-dependent anion channel isoform-1, an ANT partner. Our results suggest that betaTAC and N-betaTAC, despite their common ability to affect the microtubule network, trigger different cytotoxic mechanisms in cancer cells. The role of mitochondria in these mechanisms and the potential of N-betaTAC as a new therapeutic approach for targeting hypoxia-resistant cells are discussed.

22103808|t|Protection by remote ischemic preconditioning during coronary artery bypass graft surgery with isoflurane but not propofol - a clinical trial.
22103808|a|BACKGROUND: Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) of the myocardium by limb ischemia/reperfusion may mitigate cardiac damage, but its interaction with the anesthetic regimen is unknown. We tested whether RIPC is associated with differential effects depending on background anesthesia. Specifically, we hypothesized that RIPC during isoflurane anesthesia attenuates myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and that effects may be different during propofol anesthesia. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled prospective study, serum troponin I concentration (cTnI) (baseline, and 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively) were measured during isoflurane/sufentanil or propofol/sufentanil anesthesia with or without RIPC (three 5-min periods of intermittent left upper arm ischemia with 5 min reperfusion each) in non-diabetic patients (n = 72) with three-vessel coronary artery disease (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01406678). RESULTS: RIPC during isoflurane anesthesia (n = 20) decreased the area under the cTnI time curve (cTnI AUC) (-50%, 190  ± 105 ng/ml × 72 h vs. 383  ± 262 ng/ml × 72 h, P = 0.004), and the peak (7.3  ± 3.6 ng/ml vs. 11.8  ± 5.5, P = 0.004) and serial (P < 0.041) postoperative cTnI when compared to isoflurane alone (n = 19). In contrast, RIPC during propofol anesthesia (n = 14) did not alter the cTnI AUC [263  ± 157 ng/ml × 72 h vs. 372  ± 376 ng/ml × 72 h (n = 19), P = 0.318] or peak postoperative cTnI (10.1  ± 4.5 ng/ml vs. 12  ± 8.2, P = 0.444). None of the patients experienced harm or side effects from the intermittent left arm ischemia. CONCLUSION: Thus, RIPC during isoflurane but not during propofol anesthesia decreased myocardial damage in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Accordingly, effects of RIPC evoked by upper limb ischemia/reperfusion depend on background anesthesia, with combined RIPC/isoflurane exerting greater beneficial effects under conditions studied.

15698552|t|Dehydroepiandrosterone and its 7-hydroxylated metabolites do not interfere with the transactivation and cellular trafficking of the glucocorticoid receptor.
15698552|a|The human brain is a target tissue for glucocorticoids (GC). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a neurosteroid produced in the brain where it is transformed into 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA and 7beta-hydroxy-DHEA. The antiglucocorticoid effects of both 7-hydroxylated metabolites have been investigated with evidence in mice that neither form of DHEA interfered with the binding of GC to its glucocorticoid receptor (GR), but contributed to a decreased nuclear uptake of the activated GR. Our objective was to use COS-7 cell culture to research DHEA, 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA and 7beta-hydroxy-DHEA interferences with GR trafficking. These cells did not carry out the 7alpha-hydroxylation of DHEA and the oxidation of cortisol into cortisone. The cDNA of the human GR was inserted into pcDNA3 for a transient transfection of COS-7 cells. Human GR transactivation activity was measured from a luciferase-MMTV reporter gene. The transfected COS-7 cells were cultured using 10(-12) to 10(-5) M dexamethasone (DEX) or cortisol, which triggered the reporter expression. Treatment with 10(-12) to 10(-5) M DHEA, 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA and 7beta-hydroxy-DHEA caused no change in the GC-induced GR transactivation. A reconstruction of the process associated EGFP to the human GR cDNA. Confocal microscopic examination of COS-7 cells transiently expressing the fusion protein EGFP-GR showed nuclear fluorescence 60 min after incubation with 10(-8) M DEX or cortisol. The addition of 10(-5) M DHEA, 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA or 7beta-hydroxy-DHEA did not change its kinesis and intensity. These results contribute to the knowledge of DHEA, 7alpha-hydroxy-DHEA and 7beta-hydroxy-DHEA, in relation to antiglucocorticoid activity. We conclude that direct interference with GR trafficking can be discounted in the case of these hormones, therefore proposing new possibilities of investigation.

17184299|a|A vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolate from the urine of a liver transplant patient in Stockholm was found to contain a vanD gene. The sequence of the vanD PCR product shared 100% identity with the vanD5 allele. The isolate was resistant to a relatively high level of vancomycin (128 mg/L) and a low level of teicoplanin (4 mg/L). This is the first VanD-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolate reported in Sweden. The emergence of this strain reinforces the necessity of infection control efforts to interrupt the spread of these organisms.

8025272|t|Myeloid differentiation mediated through retinoic acid receptor/retinoic X receptor (RXR) not RXR/RXR pathway.
8025272|a|Retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, are naturally occurring ligands of the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). In concert with binding of ligand, these receptors from heterodimers with the retinoic X receptor (RXR) and transactivate RAR/RXR-responsive genes. Retinoids can differentiate leukemic cell lines in vitro and induce clinically complete remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Synthetic ligands to the RAR and RXR receptors have been developed that selectively bind and activate RAR/RXR (TTAB) and RXR/RXR dimers (SR11217). We investigated the affect of these ligands, either alone or in combination, on in vitro growth and differentiation of cells from the HL-60, KG-1, THP-1, and WEHI-3 myeloid cell lines as well as on clonal growth of fresh myeloid leukemic blasts from patients. Clonal inhibition of proliferation of these cells was studied in soft agar cultures. Cells were plated in the presence of either one or a combination of retinoids at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-10) mol/L. TTAB inhibited 50% clonal growth at an effective dose (ED50) that was about 1,000-fold lower than the concentration of SR11217 required to achieve an ED50 for the same leukemic cells. Combination of both ligands at a variety of concentrations showed no synergistic effects. Superoxide production (nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) and CD11b expression as parameters of differentiation of HL-60 cells were also examined. Results paralleled those of clonal growth, with SR11217 being markedly less potent than TTAB. These results show that the ligand selective for RXR-homodimers has little effect on either inducing differentiation or inhibiting clonal growth of leukemic cells. The differentiating and antiproliferative effects of retinoids are mainly induced through RAR/RXR heterodimers, and development of therapeutic analogs should focus on this category of retinoids.

11513817|t|Clinical and neurochemical effect of acute tryptophan depletion in unaffected relatives of patients with bipolar affective disorder.
11513817|a|BACKGROUND: The lowering of mood induced by an acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) has been proposed as a candidate endophenotype for the vulnerability to manic-depressive illness. This study tests this hypothesis in relatives of probands from well-characterized multiplex families affected with bipolar affective disorder (BAD). METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover design, 20 unaffected relatives (URs) and 19 control subjects received either a 100-g amino acid (AA) drink devoid of tryptophan or a placebo, respectively. Clinical and biochemical effects of ATD were compared between unaffected relatives of BAD probands and age- and sex-matched control subjects. RESULTS: At 5 hours after AA drink ingestion, relative to the placebo, ATD resulted in 74% and 84% decreases in total plasma tryptophan concentrations in control subjects and relatives of patients with BAD, respectively. Unlike control subjects unaffected relatives experienced a lowering of mood during ATD but not with the placebo. Furthermore, URs tended to show increased impulsivity in the ATD condition. Measurements obtained before ingestion of the AA drink indicated that, relative to control subjects URs exhibited lower serotonin platelet concentrations, lower affinity, and fewer binding sites of the serotonin transporter for imipramine; these differences were unaffected by ATD. CONCLUSION: These results replicate and extend previous findings suggesting that URs of patients with BAD are more susceptible to low tryptophan availability. This finding may bear significance in the purported role of serotonergic mechanisms in the vulnerability to depressive syndrome and/or illness.

22440403|t|A novel polypeptide extracted from Ciona savignyi induces apoptosis through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway in human colorectal carcinoma cells.
22440403|a|BACKGROUND: Sessile marine animals such as sponges, ascidians, and bryozoans are a rich source of bioactive natural products, many of which exhibit potent anticancer activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted and purified a polypeptide with potent antitumor activity from Ciona savignyi by acetone fractionation, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, gel chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. An MTT assay was used to study the cytotoxicity of the isolated fraction and the purified polypeptide. Cell cycle and Western blot analysis were performed to study the mode of action of the purified polypeptide. RESULTS: A novel polypeptide with potent antitumor activity was purified. The molecular weight of the polypeptide, designated CS5931, was 5931 Da, and use of the genome basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) revealed that the N-terminal sequence of CS5931 is identical to that of granulin A from C savignyi. CS5931 exhibited significant cytotoxicity for several cancer cell types and induced apoptotic death in HCT-8 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that CS5931 caused cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase, and a sub-G(1) peak appeared after treating the cells with CS5931 for 12 hours. The mitochondrial-mediated pathway was implicated in CS5931-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our observations clearly demonstrate the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the polypeptide CS5931 from C savignyi and the mitochondrial-mediated pathway involved in the polypeptide-induced cell death.

10764145|t|Sensitisation of HL60 human leukaemic cells to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis by inhibition of PI3-kinase survival signals.
10764145|a|Drug resistance remains a serious limiting factor in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) either at initial presentation or following primary or subsequent relapses. Using specific kinase inhibitors, this study has investigated the contribution of the Ras/PI3-kinase regulated survival pathways to drug resistance and suppression of apoptosis in a cell line derived from AML (HL60). Inhibition of the Raf/MAP-kinase (ERK) pathway with a specific MAP-kinase inhibitor, apigenin did not sensitise HL60 cells to drug-induced apoptosis, indicating a lack of involvement in chemoresistance. In contrast, the PI3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, did induce a significant increase in apoptosis in combination with cytotoxic drugs. The contribution of downstream mediators of PI3-kinase, p70S6-kinase and PKB/Akt were then investigated. While inhibition of p70S6-kinase with rapamycin did not increase drug-induced apoptosis, PI3-kinase inhibition resulted in notable dephosphorylation of PKB, suggesting that the PI3-kinase/PKB survival pathway may play a major role in chemoresistance in AML. This pathway has been reported to mediate heterodimer interactions with the proapoptotic regulator, Bad. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence of Bad binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or McI-1, or of alterations in Bax heterodimers. This suggests that alternative targets of PI3-kinase/PKB, distinct from the Bcl-2 family may be responsible for contributing to survival factor-mediated drug resistance in AML.

18958632|t|STEAP1 is over-expressed in breast cancer and down-regulated by 17beta-estradiol in MCF-7 cells and in the rat mammary gland.
18958632|a|Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) was identified as a prostate-specific cell-surface antigen over-expressed in prostate cancer, and in human cancer cell lines obtained from several other tissues. Its cell surface location in all tumor types analyzed so far, and its absence in most vital organs in humans, turned STEAP1 into a potential target for anti-tumor immunotherapy. This study provides experimental evidence that STEAP1 is also over-expressed in human breast cancer cases, and in normal breast tissue adjacent to breast tumors, where it is localized in the cell membrane of epithelial cells. It is also demonstrated that STEAP1 transcription correlates negatively with estrogen receptor (ER) immunoreactivity, and positively with tumor grading in breast cancer cases. As estrogens are involved in breast cancer onset and progression, the response of STEAP1 to 17beta-estradiol (E2) was investigated in the mammary gland of rats, and in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. These experiments demonstrated that STEAP1 is down-regulated by E2 in both models. The mechanisms underlying the STEAP1 response to E2 in vitro were further investigated in MCF-7 cells, and the results obtained suggest an effect mediated by the membrane-bound ERalpha (mbERalpha).

18978135|t|Inhalation of vasoactive intestinal peptide in pulmonary hypertension.
18978135|a|Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to an increased right ventricular workload, cardiac failure and death. In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) the vasodilating vasoactive intestinal peptide (aviptadil) is deficient. The aim of the present study was to test the acute effects on haemodynamics and blood gases, and the safety, of a single dose of inhaled aviptadil in chronic PH. A total of 20 patients with PH (PAH in nine, PH in lung disease in eight and chronic thromboembolic PH in three) inhaled a single 100-microg dose of aviptadil during right-heart catheterisation. Haemodynamics and blood gases were measured. Aviptadil aerosol caused a small and temporary but significant selective pulmonary vasodilation, an improved stroke volume and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Overall, six patients experienced a pulmonary vascular resistance reduction of >20%. In patients with significant lung disease, aviptadil tended to improve oxygenation. The pulmonary vasodilating effect of aviptadil aerosol was modest and short-lived, did not cause any side-effects and led to a reduced workload of the right ventricle without affecting systemic blood pressure. Aviptadil inhalation tended to improve oxygenation in patients with significant lung disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of aviptadil aerosol, including higher doses and chronic treatment.

24128810|t|Syncope associated with documented paroxysmal atrioventricular block reproduced by adenosine 5' triphosphate injection.
24128810|a|AIMS: We sought to investigate in patients with syncope the relationship between documented paroxysmal atrioventricular block (AVB) of unknown mechanism and AVB induced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) injection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected patients >45 years free of structural heart disease with syncope related to paroxysmal AVB documented by Holter or in-hospital monitoring, but without any trigger suggestive of vasovagal origin and with normal baseline electrocardiogram. Adenosine triphosphate test was performed according to the usual protocol. Nine patients (all females; mean age 66  ± 14.6 years; range: 48-81 years) matching the abovementioned criteria particularly documented spontaneous complete AVB with long ventricular pauses. Their mean QRS duration was 86.6  ± 14.1 ms and the mean PR interval was 161  ± 21.3 ms. In all patients, ATP induced a long ventricular pause related to AVB (mean duration 13.2 s; range from 7 to 56 s). After a mean follow-up duration of 42  ± 36 months, electrocardiogram (ECG) remained unchanged without progression to permanent AVB or appearance of intraventricular conduction disturbances. CONCLUSION: Some patients, predominantly older females, with 'normal' heart and ECG, have syncope associated with spontaneous AVB of unknown origin reproduced during the ATP test. They do not develop permanent AVB during follow-up. This unusual behaviour could be interpreted as an abnormal susceptibility to ATP and these patients could be considered to have 'ATP-sensitive AVB'. In this subgroup of syncope patients ATP test is useful.

16703549|t|Peribulbar and retrobulbar combined anesthesia for vitreoretinal surgery using ropivacaine.
16703549|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and clinical effects of local retrobulbar anesthesia using ropivacaine in vitreoretinal surgery. METHODS: Prospective study. A total of 919 vitreoretinal operations were followed. The operations were divided into three groups, depending on the degree of anesthesia needed. Group A: Vitrectomies with episcleral procedures (208 vitrectomies for detached retina or perforating trauma). Group B: Episcleral procedures only (410 operations for detached retina without vitrectomy). Group C: Vitrectomies without episcleral surgery (301 operations for macular pucker or hole, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or silicone oil removal). Anesthesia was administered using a 23-gauge Atkinson-type retrobulbar needle, after topical anesthesia. Six mL of the solution containing 7.5 mg ropivacaine/mL were injected into the peribulbar space, and the other 4 mL deeper, into the retrobulbar space. The degree of infiltration of the palpebral region, the motor block in the extrinsic ocular muscles, and pain felt were checked and rated. RESULTS: Swelling of lids was seen in 885 patients (96%); in 21 (2%) swelling was partial. In 13 patients (1%) there were no signs of infiltration. The motor block was total in 801 (87%) eyes, while 118 (12%) had reduced ocular movements. The degree of anesthesia was as follows, considering the three groups together: no pain = 855 (93%) patients; moderate pain = 44 (4%) patients; very strong pain = 20 (2%) patients. No adverse events or side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ropivacaine used for retrobulbar-peribulbar combined anesthesia in vitreoretinal surgery showed excellent clinical efficacy as regards analgesia and muscle akinesia.

1910730|t|Steroids and rhinoplasty. A double-blind study.
1910730|a|Many facial plastic surgeons use perioperative steroids to reduce postoperative edema and morbidity. This use of steroids is based more on theory and anecdotal experience than on controlled studies. We studied 49 patients undergoing rhinoplasty in a randomized, double-blind fashion to evaluate the effects of perioperative and postoperative steroid use. We found significantly less postoperative eyelid and paranasal edema in those patients receiving steroids. In addition, trends toward less ecchymosis, less intranasal edema, and less discomfort in the patients receiving steroids were noted.

24679566|t|Identification of temporal clusters and risk factors of bacteremia by nosocomial vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
24679566|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate a different methodology for addressing the evolution of nosocomial bacteremia by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in a hospital setting. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected from the date of first registration up to December 2008 from the electronic medical records of patients with VRE bacteremia in a school hospital. RESULTS: Thirty cases of VRE bacteremia and 274 cases of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) bacteremia were identified. The average age of the patients was 56 years. The rates of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) and wards showed no statistically significant differences. The risk of acquiring VRE bacteremia was at least 3-fold higher in the ICU than in the wards. The risk of death was 2.73-fold higher in patients with VRE bacteremia compared with those with VSE bacteremia. Only one temporal cluster statistically significant of VRE bacteremia was found in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of temporal clusters can be an important tool to optimize health actions and thereby reduce the burden of operating costs.

1701367|t|Progress in the enzyme diagnosis of liver disease: reality or illusion?
1701367|a|This paper discusses the progress of enzyme diagnosis by different examples. These include: the requirement for improved enzymological screening, despite the introduction of a test for hepatitis C; the imbalance between the popularity of "unexplained chronic aminotransferase elevations" and efforts to solve the inherent problems; the inadequate attempts to use the metabolic changes in the hepatocytes to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and pathophysiological understanding of viral liver diseases; the remarkable investigations into the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase for better control of interferon therapy in chronic viral hepatitis; the use of enzymes as markers of etiology, particularly for the detection of alcohol induced liver diseases; the continuing preference for the aminotransferases in this scenario although the ratios of aspartate aminotransferase over alanine aminotransferase, or of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase over total aspartate aminotransferase activity, largely depend on the severity and intralobular localization of damage and the stage of the liver disease.

24118936|t|Testicular function during adolescence in boys with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D): absence of hypogonadism and differences in endocrine profile at the beginning and end of puberty.
24118936|a|AIM: Conflicting results regarding testicular function in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have been reported, but little is known about Leydig and Sertoli cell function during puberty in boys treated with multiple daily insulin doses. Our aim was to assess testicular function in boys with T1D. METHODS: Pubertal boys with T1D (n   =   71) and healthy control boys (Control group; n   =   104) who were 10-18   years were studied. Both groups were matched by pubertal stage, age, and BMI. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (cfT), SHBG, inhibin B, AMH, and gonadotropin levels were determined. RESULTS: At the beginning of puberty, the T1D group had higher levels of SHBG (p   =   0.003) and similar androgen levels than the Control group. At the end of puberty, higher TT, and cfT were observed in T1D compared to the Control group (p   <   0.01 and p   <   0.001, respectively). Gonadotropins and AMH were similar in both groups. Regression analysis showed that T1D was a significant factor, even after adjusting for Tanner stage and BMI-SDS, affecting TT, cFT, and SHBG levels. BMI-SDS was a significant factor affecting TT and SHBG levels. Higher HbA1c had a negative effect on total testosterone and cFT and a positive effect on SHBG levels in T1D boys. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with T1D do not exhibit hypogonadism, as shown by normal gonadotropin, testosterone, inhibin B, and AMH levels. However, in T1D boys, HbA1c and BMI-SDS had a negative association with testosterone levels. Elevated testosterone levels are observed during late puberty, which were not present earlier.

25114528|t|Enhanced activity of carbosilane dendrimers against HIV when combined with reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs: searching for more potent microbicides.
25114528|a|Self-administered topical microbicides or oral preexposure prophylaxis could be very helpful tools for all risk groups to decrease the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection rates. Up until now, antiretrovirals (ARVs) have been the most advanced microbicide candidates. Nevertheless, the majority of clinical trials has failed in HIV-1 patients. Nanotechnology offers suitable approaches to develop novel antiviral agents. Thereby, new nanosystems, such as carbosilane dendrimers, have been shown to be safe and effective compounds against HIV with great potential as topical microbicides. In addition, because most of the attempts to develop effective topical microbicides were unsuccessful, combinatorial strategies could be a valid approach when designing new microbicides. We evaluated various combinations of anionic carbosilane dendrimers with sulfated (G3-S16) and naphthyl sulfonated (G2-NF16) ended groups with different ARVs against HIV-1 infection. The G3-S16 and G2-NF16 dendrimers showed a synergistic or additive activity profile with zidovudine, efavirenz, and tenofovir in the majority of the combinations tested against the X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1 in cell lines, as well as in human primary cells. Therefore, the combination of ARVs and polyanionic carbosilane dendrimers enhances the antiviral potency of the individual compounds, and our findings support further clinical research on combinational approaches as potential microbicides to block the sexual transmission of HIV-1.

16631625|t|In vitro responsiveness of human-drug-resistant tissue to antiepileptic drugs: insights into the mechanisms of pharmacoresistance.
16631625|a|Pharmacoresistance in epileptic patients may be ascribed to at least two, not mutually exclusive, mechanisms: a pharmacokinetic mechanism and a decreased sensitivity or availability of targets to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; i.e., carbamazepine and phenytoin (CBZ, PHT)). Brain:plasma drug concentration ratios were determined intraoperatively during lobectomies performed to alleviate drug-resistant seizures. The brain:plasma ratio of CBZ was 1.48 when therapeutic serum levels (15-34 microM) were achieved. When concentrations of CBZ found in multiple-drug-resistant brain were directly applied to human cortical slices from drug-resistant patients made hyperexcitable and hypersynchronous by Mg(2+)-free media, bursting frequency was not significantly affected and overall excitability was reduced by 40%. Similar results were obtained for PHT. At higher AED concentrations (60-200 microM), a dose-dependent decrease of bursting frequency and amplitude was observed. Slices from drug-resistant epileptic patients made hypersynchronous/hyperexcitable by elevated potassium or inhibition of GABA-A receptors behaved similarly. Of note is the response of slices from human multiple-drug-resistant brain, which was greater than in rodent cortex from naive animals. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that multiple drug resistance to AEDs involves cerebrovascular changes that impede the achievement of appropriate drug levels in the central nervous system.

22225575|t|Melatonin sensitizes human hepatoma cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.
22225575|a|Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell apoptosis is implicated in the development of cancer. Melatonin induces apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in experimental studies, but the effects of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in HCC have not been tested. Differences in ER stress-induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells and normal human hepatocyte were investigated by exposure to tunicamycin (ER stress inducer). Significant differences were observed in the rate of apoptosis between HepG2 cells (hepatoma cells) and HL-7702 cells (normal human hepatocyte cells). The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was increased in HepG2 cells but not in HL-7702 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of COX-2 expression using the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, increased tunicamycin-induced apoptosis concomitant with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153) and down-regulation of B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio, suggesting that inhibition of COX-2 sensitized human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, co-treatment with tunicamycin and melatonin also decreased the expression of COX-2 and significantly increased the rate of apoptosis by elevating the levels of CHOP and reducing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results demonstrate that melatonin sensitizes human hepatoma cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis by down-regulating COX-2 expression, increasing the levels of CHOP and decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.

9751945|t|Cardiovascular effects of alcohol.
9751945|a|The ingestion of one or two alcoholic drinks can affect heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow. These actions generally are not clinically important. In the presence of cardiovascular disease, however, even such small quantities of alcohol might result in transient unfavorable hemodynamic changes. Moreover, alcohol abuse can produce cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and even sudden death. In contrast, moderate alcohol use produces changes that have an overall favorable effect on atherosclerotic-related vascular diseases. Because cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in Western society, this desirable effect of alcohol use outweighs its detrimental actions, resulting in favorable findings in population studies. Nevertheless, the body of evidence argues against encouraging alcohol use for its cardiovascular effects.

14963251|t|Mortality of workers at a plant manufacturing nickel alloys, 1958-2000.
14963251|a|BACKGROUND: Excess risks of respiratory cancer have been demonstrated in some groups of nickel-exposed workers. It is clear, however, that not all forms of nickel exposure are implicated in these excess risks. Aim To determine whether occupational exposures received in the manufacture of nickel alloys lead to increased risks of cancer, in particular nasal cancer and lung cancer. METHODS: The mortality experienced by a cohort of 1999 workers employed at a plant manufacturing nickel alloys has been investigated. Study subjects were all those male workforce employees first employed in the period 1953-1992 who had at least 5 years employment with the company. Observed numbers of cause-specific deaths were compared with expectations based on national mortality rates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by period from commencing employment and by operating area of first job. In addition, rate ratios derived from Poisson regression and based on an internal standard were calculated by levels of duration of employment. RESULTS: SMRs were significantly below 100 for all causes (observed 557, expected 704.3, SMR 79), all neoplasms (observed 169, expected 209.4, SMR 81) non-malignant diseases of the respiratory system (observed 50, expected 73.0, SMR 69) and diseases of the circulatory system (observed 261, expected 335.5, SMR 78). Significantly elevated SMRs were not shown for any cause of death and mortality was below expectation for stomach cancer (observed 8, expected 16.0, SMR 50), lung cancer (observed 64, expected 73.6, SMR 87) and bladder cancer (observed 3, expected 8.0, SMR 38). There were no deaths from nasal cancer (expected 0.33). More detailed findings were unexceptional. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses did not suggest the presence of an occupational cancer hazard in the mortality experience of the cohort.

20334460|t|Role of intraarterial therapy for cerebral vasospasm secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
20334460|a|Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for a significant percentage of morbidity and mortality among patients admitted to neurosurgical centers throughout the world. Even for individuals surviving beyond the initial presentation and intervention for aneurysmal SAH, the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm has the potential to induce a second tier of complications that can be just as devastating as the inciting event. However, despite numerous studies and some initial advancements in management, therapeutic modalities are limited to help prevent or treat this complex entity. Historically, the mainstay of treatment for cerebral vasospasm has been a combination of hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension. In addition, other systemic therapies such as oral nimodipine, statins, and intravenous magnesium, as well as intensive glucose control, appear to have some promise, although they are limited at times by adverse effects. To avoid these adverse consequences and perhaps gain some modicum of efficacy, attempts have been made to use endovascular techniques to physically dilate vessels or to administer drugs directly to the site of action and thus avoid many of the untoward effects of systemic pharmacotherapy. Controversy still remains over the success of intraarterial therapy, the drugs or techniques to be used, and the best timing of this therapy. Based on the currently available literature, it is impossible to assess the most effective intraarterial therapy. Randomized controlled trials that can control for baseline factors and technical expertise are needed to provide more conclusive data. Clinical pharmacists should be actively involved in assisting interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons in providing safe and appropriate pharmacotherapy in this promising but controversial arena of intraarterial drug delivery.

21788355|t|Metronomic oral topotecan with pazopanib is an active antiangiogenic regimen in mouse models of aggressive pediatric solid tumor.
21788355|a|PURPOSE: Low dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy, combined with VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors, is a highly effective strategy to coordinately inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in many adult preclinical cancer models. We have tested the efficacies of daily oral LDM topotecan alone and in combination with pazopanib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor, in three pediatric extracranial solid tumor mouse models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro dose-response study of topotecan and pazopanib was conducted on several neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. In vivo antitumor efficacies of the LDM topotecan and pazopanib as single agents and in combination were tested on 4 subcutaneous xenograft models and on 2 neuroblastoma metastatic models. Circulating angiogenic factors such as circulating endothelial cells (CEC), circulating endothelial pro genitor cells (CEP), and microvessel densities were used as surrogate biomarker markers of antiangiogenic activity. RESULTS: In vitro, topotecan caused a dose-dependent decrease in viabilities of all cell lines, while pazopanib did not. In vivo, combination of topotecan + pazopanib (TP + PZ) showed significant antitumor activity and significant enhancement in survival compared with the respective single agents in all models. Reductions in viable CEP and/or CEC levels and tumor microvessel density were correlated with tumor response and therefore confirmed the antiangiogenic activity of the regimens. Pharmacokinetic studies of both drugs did not reveal any drug-drug interaction. CONCLUSION: Metronomic administration of TP + PZ showed a statistically significant antitumor activity compared with respective single agents in pediatric tumor mouse models and represent a valid option as a maintenance therapy in aggressive pediatric solid tumors.

21798680|t|Influence of multiple injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on urine and serum endogenous steroids concentrations.
21798680|a|Since it is established that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) affects testosterone production and release in the human body, the use of this hormone as a performance enhancing drug has been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Nowadays, the only validated biomarker of a hCG doping is its direct quantification in urine. However, this specific parameter is subjected to large inter-individual variability and its determination is directly dependent on the reliability of hCG immunoassays used. In order to counteract these weaknesses, new biomarkers need to be evidenced. To address this issue, a pilot clinical study was performed on 10 volunteers submitted to 3 subsequent hCG injections. Blood and urine samples were collected during two weeks in order to follow the physiological effects on related compounds such as the steroid profile or hormones involved in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. The hCG pharmacokinetic observed in all subjects was, as expected, prone to important inter-individual variations. Using ROC plots, level of testosterone and testosterone on luteinizing hormone ratio in both blood and urine were found to be the most relevant biomarker of a hCG abuse, regardless of inter-individual variations. In conclusion, this study showed the crucial importance of reliable quantification methods to assess low differences in hormonal patterns. In regard to these results and to anti-doping requirements and constraints, blood together with urine matrix should be included in the anti-doping testing program. Together with a longitudinal follow-up approach it could constitute a new strategy to detect a hCG abuse, applicable to further forms of steroid or other forbidden drug manipulation.

23934356|t|Repair of symptomatic perineal hernia with a titanium mesh.
23934356|a|PURPOSE: Surgical repair of symptomatic perineal hernia is challenging, especially via a perineal approach with limited exposure of the hernia sac. Furthermore, insecure fixation of autologous or synthetic materials to bony structures often results in recurrence. Here, we describe the application of a titanium mesh for perineal hernia repair. METHODS: We performed hernia repair with a thin titanium mesh via a perineal approach in three patients who developed secondary perineal hernia following abdominoperineal resection. After the hernia sac was isolated and dissected, the titanium mesh was molded and placed over the ischium and coccyx to support the pelvic floor. RESULTS: No major complications occurred, and all three patients were free of recurrence at follow-up after 73, 109, and 6 months, respectively. The patients experienced slight pain in the perineal region when sitting, which resolved within 6 months. CONCLUSION: Our successful preliminary results indicate that a titanium mesh is useful for perineal hernia repair by the perineal approach, as it can provide rigid support for the pelvic floor by its entire surface while ensuring stability without any fixation.

17401397|t|Targeting the stem cell niche: squeezing blood from bones.
17401397|a|During human development, stem cells establish themselves in specific anatomic locations or niches. The niche harbors the stem cells, and regulates how stem cells proliferate. The interaction between stem cells and their niche affects stem cell function, and offers an opportunity to improve the marrow microenvironment. Osteoblasts produce hematopoietic growth factors and are activated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). A calcium sensing receptor, expressed by hematopoietic stem cells, regulates the niche and can be targeted to increase stem cell numbers. Therefore, drugs that affect osteoblast function or target calcium receptors may be useful for stem cell mobilization and engraftment. In this review, the biology of the stem cell niche and the potential therapeutic manipulations of the stem cell niche are reviewed. PTH is in clinical trials for patients who have not mobilized autologous stem cells well. The limiting cell numbers for adult cord blood transplantation increase the risk of infection, and PTH is currently in a clinical trial following cord blood transplantation in an effort to improve engraftment and immune reconstitution.

24624912|t|Clinical course of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: can we predict the prognosis?
24624912|a|AIM: This study aimed to identify prognostic factors of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by comparing clinical and genetic data with the clinical course. PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients were classified into two groups according to their response to inhalation rechallenge with lysine-aspirin after at least 1 year of regular treatment with antiasthmatic medications. RESULTS: Forty eight patients (39.3%, group I) had negative responses, whereas 74 patients (60.7%, group II) had positive responses (n = 23) or were not rechallenged owing to persistent symptoms (n = 51). FEV  at diagnosis and follow-up were significantly lower in group II than in group I. The CCR3 polymorphism at -520T/G differed significantly between the two groups, whereas no difference was found in other SNPs. CONCLUSION: Baseline FEV  and lower lung function after treatment were clinical factors indicating a poor prognosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. The G allele of CCR3 -520T>G was associated with persistent bronchial hypersensitivity to aspirin.

14985680|t|Effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in pregnancy on maternal and fetal erythrocyte fatty acid composition.
14985680|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of fish oil supplementation in pregnancy on maternal erythrocyte fatty acid composition at different stages of pregnancy and in the post-partum period, and on neonatal erythrocyte fatty acid composition. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: : Subiaco, Western Australia. SUBJECTS: In all, 98 women booked for delivery at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco, were recruited from private rooms of obstetricians. In total, 83 women and their healthy full-term babies completed the study. INTERVENTION: Women received either 4 g of fish oil (n=52) (56% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 28% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or placebo (olive oil) (n=46) per day from 20 weeks gestation until delivery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acids were measured in maternal peripheral blood at 20, 30 and 37 weeks of pregnancy and at 6 weeks post partum, and from cord blood collected at birth. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, maternal EPA and DHA were significantly higher in the fish oil group at 30 and 37 weeks gestation, and remained elevated at 6 weeks post partum (P<0.001). The proportions of n-6 polyunsaturated (arachidonic acid, 22:3n-6 and 22:4n-6) were significantly lower in the fish oil supplemented group at the same time periods (P<0.001). Similarly, the proportions of EPA and DHA were significantly higher (P<0.001), and those of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid, 20:3n-6, 22:3n-6 and 22:4n-6 were significantly lower (P<0.001), in erythrocytes from neonates in the fish oil group, compared to those in the control group. CONCLUSION: Fish oil supplementation from 20 weeks of pregnancy until birth is an effective means of enhancing n-3 fatty acid status of both mothers and neonates. Furthermore, the changes in maternal erythrocyte fatty acid composition are retained until at least 6 weeks post partum. It is essential to assess the effects of concomitant decreases in arachidonic acid status before any dietary recommendations can be made. SPONSORSHIP: The study was supported by grants from the NH & MRC and Raine Medical Research Foundation, Australia.

10757446|t|Establishment of a quantitative mouse dorsal air sac model and its application to evaluate a new angiogenesis inhibitor.
10757446|a|We have developed an improved mouse dorsal air sac model for quantifying in vivo tumor-induced angiogenesis. In our improved model, tumor angiogenesis is determined by measuring the blood volume in an area of skin held in contact with a tumor cell-containing chamber, using 51Cr-labeled red blood cells (RBC). The blood volume induced by murine B16-BL6 melanoma cells increased linearly with the cell number in the range from 2 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(6). Ten of 11 human tumor cell lines examined induced a significant increment in blood volume. For three representative human tumor cell lines (A549, WiDr. and HT1080 cells) that showed different angiogenic potencies, the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by the tumor cells cultured under conditions of hypoxia and high cell density were correlated with the degree of in vivo angiogenesis. Using the improved model, it was confirmed that TNP-470, a well-known inhibitor, and borrelidin, an antibiotic from Streptomyces rochei, significantly inhibited the WiDr cell-induced angiogenesis. Borrelidin also inhibited spontaneous lung metastasis of B16-BL6 melanoma at the same dose that inhibited angiogenesis. Our results suggest that the improved mouse dorsal air sac model can be used for simple and quantitative measurement of tumor-induced angiogenesis and its inhibition.

17612931|t|Adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.
17612931|a|Nearly half of all patients who undergo surgical resection of localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will develop and ultimately die of recurrent disease. The postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) meta-analysis showed adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy to have a detrimental effect on survival in this patient population. A meta-analysis of early trials of adjuvant chemotherapy by the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group showed that while chemotherapy with alkylating agents was also detrimental, chemotherapy with cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an improved hazard ratio for death (HR = 0.87), equating to a 5 percent survival benefit at 5 years. However, the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Recently, results have been reported for several large Phase III trials of adjuvant chemotherapy which differed with respect to the stage of resected disease included, the type of chemotherapy used and the use of post-operative radiotherapy. Three trials (IALT, JBR 10, and ANITA) that utilized cisplatin-based doublets showed a significantly positive survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Stage II-IIIA NSCLC. The magnitude of this benefit, which was suggested to be 4-5 percent at 5 years in the meta-analysis and by the IALT study, may be as large as 8-15 percent as indicated by more recent studies with modern platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. These data indicate that medically fit patients with resected Stage II-IIIA NSCLC should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy with a modern cisplatin-based doublet.

24573510|t|Action of an extract from the seeds of Fraxinus excelsior L. on metabolic disorders in hypertensive and obese animal models.
24573510|a|Nuzhenide and GI3, the principal secoiridoids of an extract obtained from the seeds of Fraxinus excelsior L. (FXE), are believed to be the active compounds responsible for the previously reported hypoglycemic effects of this extract. In this study, the effects of FXE were studied in two animal models which are representative of metabolic disorders: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and obese Zucker rats. SHR were acutely treated (oral gavage) with different doses of FXE. In addition, SHR and Zucker rats were chronically fed (20 or 5 weeks, respectively) with standard chow supplemented with FXE. Acute treatment with FXE (200 mg per kg body weight) decreased systolic blood pressure as in the case with captopril (50 mg per kg body weight). Chronic treatment with FXE at 100 mg per kg body weight per day, a dose equivalent to that showing hypoglycemic activity in humans, resulted in a significant decrease in glycemia (-16.3%), triglyceridemia (-33.4%) and body weight (-8.1%) in Zucker rats as well as a significant decrease in SBP in SHR (-6.7%), with a concomitant improvement in endothelial function in both strains. The broad-ranging effects of FXE may be due to a unique compositional profile that could be useful to prevent the metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated blood pressure.

12571477|t|Complications of multilevel cervical corpectomies and reconstruction with titanium cages and anterior plating.
12571477|a|The ideal surgical treatment of multilevel cervical spondylosis remains unclear. This study analyzed the complications in using titanium cages and plating to reconstruct multilevel cervical corpectomies. This was a retrospective analysis of 21 consecutive patients who had multilevel cervical corpectomies and reconstruction with titanium cages and anterior plating. Sixteen had 2-level, one had 2.5-level, three had 3-level, and one had 3.5-level corpectomies. All had reconstruction with titanium cages and anterior plating. Thirty-three percent of the patients developed complications. Radiographs revealed bony consolidation in 95% of patients. Reconstructing multilevel cervical corpectomies with titanium cages and plating is associated with complications. Advantages include rigid immobilization and the avoidance of iliac crest bone graft harvesting. Major complications are largely the result of failures of the cage and plate construct, especially in patients with osteopenic bone. Supplemental posterior stabilization may be considered for cases with spasticity or greater than 2-level corpectomies with profound osteoporosis.

16036193|t|Preemptive analgesia installation during gynecologic laparoscopy: a randomized trial.
16036193|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative infusion of bupivacaine solution for the relief of pain after operative gynecologic laparoscopy. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I4). SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-one women aged 16 to 69 years who underwent gynecologic laparoscopic surgery from November 2002 through November 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Group A (n = 30): intraperitoneal infusion of a mixture of 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (50 mg) with epinephrine (1:500) in 40 mL of Ringer's lactate solution postoperatively. Group B (n = 30): the same mixture solution infusion preoperatively and postoperatively (total 100 mg bupivacaine). Group C (n = 31): placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Shoulder tip pain (STP), abdominal parietal pain (APP), and abdominal visceral pain (AVP) were recorded on a visual analog scale at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours postoperatively. A total of 79 patients fulfilled the study criteria. The overall incidence of STP was 60.8%. Abdominal visceral pain in group B was significantly less than in group C at 2 and 4 hours postoperatively (p = .011 and p = .010, respectively). No statistically significant difference was found in length of hospital stay, postoperative meperidine consumption, or side effects. CONCLUSION: Intraperitoneal bupivacaine administration both immediately after placement of trocars and at the end of surgery was found to be effective in reducing the intensity of AVP but not in reducing STP, APP, or postoperative analgesia consumption after nonadvanced gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. The duration of the analgesic effect of bupivacaine instilled into the peritoneal cavity did not exceed 8 hours and probably was not dose related.

20559618|t|TVT compared with TVT-O and TOT: results from the Norwegian National Incontinence Registry.
20559618|a|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study is to compare the outcome and complication rates of the tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) operations with the transobturator vaginal tape (TVT-O and TOT) operations in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence. METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective cohort study. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included a validated Stress and Urge Incontinence Questionnaire, a 24-h pad test, and a standardized stress test. RESULTS: The study included 5,942 women--4,281 women had a TVT operation and 731 and 373 women had TVT-O and TOT operations, respectively. Median follow-up time was 8 months. Women in the TVT group had less leakage during stress test and fewer subjective stress incontinence symptoms, and were more satisfied with the operation compared with the women in TVT-O and TOT groups, but more complications were reported after TVT operation. CONCLUSIONS: The TVT operation is more efficient than TVT-O and TOT operations in treating stress incontinent women.

22892391|t|MicroRNA-204 increases sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to cisplatin and is associated with a favourable clinical outcome.
22892391|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma remains a major cause of cancer-linked mortality in children. miR-204 has been used in microRNA expression signatures predictive of neuroblastoma patient survival. The aim of this study was to explore the independent association of miR-204 with survival in a neuroblastoma cohort, and to investigate the phenotypic effects mediated by miR-204 expression in neuroblastoma. METHODS: Neuroblastoma cell lines were transiently transfected with miR-204 mimics and assessed for cell viability using MTS assays. Apoptosis levels in cell lines were evaluated by FACS analysis of Annexin V-/propidium iodide-stained cells transfected with miR-204 mimics and treated with chemotherapy drug or vehicle control. Potential targets of miR-204 were validated using luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: miR-204 expression in primary neuroblastoma tumours was predictive of patient event-free and overall survival, independent of established known risk factors. Ectopic miR-204 expression significantly increased sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide in vitro. miR-204 direct targeting of the 3' UTR of BCL2 and NTRK2 (TrkB) was confirmed. CONCLUSION: miR-204 is a novel predictor of outcome in neuroblastoma, functioning, at least in part, through increasing sensitivity to cisplatin by direct targeting and downregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2. miR-204 also targets full-length NTRK2, a potent oncogene involved with chemotherapy drug resistance in neuroblastoma.

8710741|t|The use of surfactants to enhance the permeability of peptides through Caco-2 cells by inhibition of an apically polarized efflux system.
8710741|a|PURPOSE: It has recently been reported that the permeability of peptides across Caco-2 cells, an in vitro model of the intestinal mucosa, was limited by an apically polarized efflux mechanism. Since surfactants (e.g. Cremophor EL, Polysorbate 80) have been reported to inhibit similar efflux systems in tumor cells, we determined whether they could enhance the permeability of peptides across monolayers of Caco-2 cells. METHODS: The transport studies of [3H]-mannitol and [14C]-model peptides were carried out across the Caco-2 cell monolayers. TEER values were determined using Voltohmmeter with STX-2 electrode and the equilibrium dialysis studies were conducted using side-by-side dialysis apparatus with cellulose ester membranes. RESULTS: Initially, [3H]-mannitol flux studies were conducted to find concentrations of the surfactants that did not cause damage to the cell monolayer. Based on these studies, Polysorbate 80 and Cremophor EL were selected for further study. The fluxes of [14C]-AcfNH2 (a nonsubstrate for this efflux system) and [14C]-Acf(N-Mef)2NH2 (a substrate for this efflux system) were then measured in the absence and presence of the two surfactants. The permeability of [14C]-AcfNH2 was not affected by the surfactants, while that of [14C]-Acf(N-Mef)2NH2 increased with increasing concentrations of surfactants and then decreased. For example, the Pe values for [14C]-Acf(N-Mef)2NH2 were 3.75 x 10(-6), 8.58 x 10(-6), 10.29 x 10(-6), 7.48 x 10(-6), and 1.46 x 10(-6) cm/sec with Cremophor EL concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10% w/v, respectively. This bimodal effect of surfactants on the Caco-2 cell permeability of this peptide was shown to be due to the interactions between the peptide and micelles at higher concentrations of surfactants, which were demonstrated by the equilibrium dialysis experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that surfactants, which are commonly added to pharmaceutical formulations, may enhance the intestinal absorption of some drugs by inhibiting this apically polarized efflux system.

17823640|t|Regression of radiation-induced macular edema after systemic bevacizumab.
17823640|a|CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old patient with a coexisting primary choroidal melanoma and colorectal cancer was treated with external beam radiation (EBR) of his choroidal melanoma and systemic chemotherapy with leukovorin/5 fluorouracil (FU) for treatment of his metastatic colorectal cancer. Eight months following EBR, he showed evidence of radiation retinopathy with macular edema. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed macular edema and subretinal fluid. Subsequently, systemic bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) was added to his leukovorin/5FU chemotherapy. After the addition of bevacizumab, OCT showed complete resolution of the macular edema and subretinal fluid. COMMENTS: Bevacizumab may have a role in the treatment of radiation retinopathy, but further investigation is needed before any definitive conclusions can be made.

16409345|t|Levosimendan: a promising treatment for myocardial stunning?
16409345|a|We report a case of a 55-year-old male undergoing major orofacial cancer surgery. A stent to the left anterior descending artery had been implanted for ischaemic heart disease 3 years previously. Twenty-four hours after uneventful anaesthesia and surgery, the patient developed myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Immediate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, intra aortic balloon counterpulsation, and catecholamine therapy failed to stabilise haemodynamics. In light of successful reperfusion therapy and an only moderate elevation of troponin I, myocardial stunning rather than myonecrosis was considered to be the major contributor to life-threatening left ventricular failure. Therefore, the calcium-sensitising drug levosimendan, which exerts positive inotropic activity without increasing myocardial oxygen demand, was administered as a rescue medication. Within 24 h, levosimendan resulted in decreased filling pressures, reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and augmented systemic pressures. Seven days following surgery, the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit in good clinical condition.

11060714|t|Zaleplon - a review of a novel sedative hypnotic used in the treatment of insomnia.
11060714|a|Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam.

16635616|t|Effects of statins on renal function after aortic cross clamping during major vascular surgery.
16635616|a|Ischemic reperfusion injury is an important cause of renal dysfunction after major vascular surgery and increases postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of statins on renal function in patients at high risk for renal dysfunction, that is, those who underwent suprarenal aortic cross clamping-declamping. Seventy-seven patients (28 statin users, 57 men; mean age 69 +/- 8 years) with normal preoperative renal function requiring suprarenal aortic cross clamping-declamping during vascular surgery from 1995 to 2005 were studied. Creatinine levels were obtained before surgery and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 30 after surgery. An analysis-of-variance model for repeated measurements was applied to compare creatinine levels between statin users and nonusers, with adjustment for clamping time and blood loss. There were no differences in baseline clinical characteristics, preoperative creatinine levels (0.93 vs 0.96 mg/dl, p = 0.59), and glomerular filtration rate (79 vs 73 ml/min, p = 0.1). Postoperative creatinine levels during the 30 days after surgery were significantly lower in statin users than in nonusers (analysis-of-variance p <0.01, 1.17 vs 1.98 mg/dl). Postoperative hemodialysis was required (temporarily) in 7 patients (9.1%), all statin nonusers. These findings suggest an association between statin use and preserved renal function after suprarenal aortic clamping.

23959098|t|Anti-apoptotic phenotypes of cholestan-3b,5a,6b-triol-resistant human cholangiocytes: characteristics contributing to the genesis of cholangiocarcinoma.
23959098|a|The oxysterols cholestan-3b,5a,6b-triol (Triol) and 3-keto-cholest-4-ene (3K4) are increased in Opisthorchis viverrini-associated hamster cholangiocarcinoma and induce DNA damage and apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent mechanism in MMNK-1 human cholangiocytes. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that chronic exposure of cholangiocytes to these pathogenic oxysterols may allow a growth advantage to a subset of these cells through selection for resistance to apoptosis, thereby contributing to cholangiocarcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we cultured MMNK-1 cells long-term in the presence of Triol. Alteration in survival and apoptotic factors of Triol-exposed cells were examined. Cells cultured long-term in the presence of Triol were resistant to H2O2-induced apoptosis, and demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of p38-a, CREB, ERK1/2 and c-Jun. Elevations in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and in the protein levels of anti-apoptotic factors including cIAP2, clusterin, and survivin were detected. These results show that long-term exposure of MNNK-1 cells to low doses of Triol selects for kinase-signaling molecules which regulate resistance to apoptosis and thereby enhance cell survival. Clonal expansion of such apoptosis-resistant cells may contribute to the genesis of cholangiocarcinoma.

10585306|t|Microalbuminuria in essential hypertension: significance, pathophysiology, and therapeutic implications.
10585306|a|Some patients with essential hypertension manifest greater than normal urinary albumin excretion (UAE). The significance of this association, which is the object of this review, is not well established. Hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria manifest greater levels of blood pressure, particularly at night, and higher serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid than patients with normal UAE. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, on the other hand, were lower in patients with microalbuminuria than in those with normal UAE. Patients with microalbuminuria manifested greater incidence of insulin resistance and thicker carotid arteries than patients with normal UAE. After a follow-up of 7 years, we observed that 12 cardiovascular events occurred among 54 (21.3%) patients with microalbuminuria and only two such events among 87 patients with normal UAE (P < 0.0002). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that UAE, cholesterol level, and diastolic blood pressure were independent predictors of the cardiovascular outcome. Rate of creatinine clearance from patients with microalbuminuria decreased more than that from those with normal UAE. In conclusion, these studies suggest that hypertensive individuals with microalbuminuria manifest a variety of biochemical and hormonal derangements with pathogenic potential, which results in hypertensive patients having a greater incidence of cardiovascular events and a greater decline in renal function than patients with normal UAE.

16768643|t|Adjunctive lamotrigine treatment for adolescents with bipolar disorder: retrospective report of five cases.
16768643|a|BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive lamotrigine in the treatment of adolescents with bipolar disorder. METHOD: We evaluated all patients under age 18 with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) bipolar disorder in our outpatient clinic treated with lamotrigine, using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. We rated response with the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. RESULTS: Five patients (mean age = 15.5 +/- 1.8 years; range = 14-17), 1 male and 4 females, were included. One patient (20%) had bipolar I disorder, 1 (20%) had bipolar II disorder, and 3 (60%) had bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). The polarity of the episode at baseline was depressive in all patients. The mean lamotrigine dose was 100 +/- 87.5 mg/day (1.67 +/- 1.39 mg/kg/day). The mean duration of treatment was 28 +/- 28 weeks. CGI significantly improved from 5 at baseline to 3 +/- 1 at endpoint (p = 0.011). Improvement was marked or moderate in 4 patients (80%) and minimal in 1 patient (20%). One patient referred to dizziness, and there were no reports of increased cycling, worsening of mania, or skin rash. CONCLUSIONS: This open, retrospective chart review suggests that lamotrigine may be effective and well tolerated as an adjunctive treatment in adolescents with bipolar disorder. Controlled trials are needed.

19667285|t|Differential effects of tipranavir plus ritonavir on atorvastatin or rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.
19667285|a|To identify pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions between tipranavir-ritonavir (TPV/r) and rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, we conducted two prospective, open-label, single-arm, two-period studies. The geometric mean (GM) ratio was 1.37 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.62) for the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for rosuvastatin and 2.23 (90% CI, 1.83 to 2.72) for the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) for rosuvastatin with TPV/r at steady state versus alone. The GM ratio was 9.36 (90% CI, 8.02 to 10.94) for the AUC of atorvastatin and 8.61 (90% CI, 7.25 to 10.21) for the Cmax of atorvastatin with TPV/r at steady state versus alone. Tipranavir PK parameters were not affected by single-dose rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. Mild gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, and mild reversible liver enzyme elevations (grade 1 and 2) were the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions. Based on these interactions, we recommend low initial doses of rosuvastatin (5 mg) and atorvastatin (10 mg), with careful clinical monitoring of rosuvastatin- or atorvastatin-related adverse events when combined with TPV/r.

24801589|t|Psychological morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with stable treatment for primary adrenal insufficiency: cross-sectional study and review of the literature.
24801589|a|CONTEXT: A high prevalence of psychological morbidity and maladaptive personality as well as impaired quality of life (QoL) is observed in patients with and without hydrocortisone dependency following (cured) Cushing's syndrome. However, it is currently unclear whether a similar pattern is present in patients with chronic glucocorticoid replacement for primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psychological functioning, personality traits, and QoL in patients with PAI. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A cross-sectional study including 54 patients with stable treatment for PAI and 54 healthy matched controls. Both patients and controls completed questionnaires on psychological functioning (Apathy Scale, Irritability Scale, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire short form, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), personality traits (Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology short form), and QoL (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Short Form 36, EuroQoL-5D, Nottingham Health Profile, and Physical Symptom Checklist). RESULTS: Patients with PAI suffered from more psychological morbidity (i.e. irritability and somatic arousal) and QoL impairments compared with controls (all P<0.01). There were no differences regarding maladaptive personality traits between patients and controls. However, there was a strong and consistent positive association between the daily hydrocortisone dose and prevalence of maladaptive personality traits (i.e. identity problems, cognitive distortion, compulsivity, restricted expression, callousness, oppositionality, rejection, conduct problems, social avoidance, narcissism, and insecure attachment, all P<0.05). There was also a strong relation between the mean daily hydrocortisone dose and both psychological morbidity (i.e. depression, P<0.05) and QoL impairments (i.e. general health perception, several measures of physical functioning, and vitality, all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients on stable glucocorticoid replacement therapy for PAI report psychological morbidity and impaired QoL. Psychological morbidity, impaired QoL, and maladaptive personality traits were all associated with higher dosages of hydrocortisone.

20595705|t|Plasma levels of beta-endorphin during pregnancy and use of labor analgesia.
20595705|a|Beta-endorphins are endogenous opioid substances produced by the pituitary gland and placenta. The aims of this project were to longitudinally follow plasma levels of beta-endorphin during pregnancy in women with a healthy pregnancy and to investigate whether plasma levels of beta-endorphin in late pregnancy are associated with need for additional pain medication beyond nitrous oxide during labor. Plasma samples from 45 women were collected at gestational weeks 10, 25, 28, 33 and 37, and beta-endorphin was analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Plasma levels of beta-endorphin displayed a significant decrease in gestational weeks 28 and 33 compared to week 10, followed by a subsequent increase between gestational weeks 28 and 37. However, there was no change in levels of beta-endorphin between gestational weeks 10 and 37. Low levels of beta-endorphin at the end of pregnancy were associated with need for additional pain medication beyond nitrous oxide during labor, although the causal relationship is unclear.

12003381|t|A randomized controlled trial of cyanoacrylate versus alcohol injection in patients with isolated fundic varices.
12003381|a|OBJECTIVE: Treatment of bleeding gastric varices (GVs) is still controversial, mainly because of anecdotal studies or inclusion of patients with GVs located at different sites that have variable incidences of bleeding. A prospective study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of GV sclerotherapy using alcohol and GV obturation using cyanoacrylate glue. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients with portal hypertension and endoscopic evidence of isolated GVs, 17 presenting with histories of active bleeding, were randomized to receive endoscopic intervention either with alcohol (n = 17) or with cyanoacrylate glue (n = 20) injection. Variceal obliteration, rebleeding, or death was the endpoint. RESULTS: The glue was significantly more effective in achieving variceal obliteration than alcohol (100% vs 44%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, this could be achieved in a significantly shorter period (2.0 +/- 1.6 vs 4.7 +/- 3.2 wk, p < 0.05) and with a smaller volume of the agent. Cyanoacrylate glue injection could achieve arrest of acute GV bleeding more often than alcohol (89% vs 62%), and the need for rescue surgery was less; the difference was, however, not significant. Six patients died from uncontrolled GV bleeding, four being in the alcohol group. During a mean follow-up of 15.4 +/- 3.7 months there was no recurrence of GVs in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that cyanoacrylate is more effective and achieves GV obliteration faster than injection sclerotherapy with alcohol. It also appears to be more useful in controlling acute GV bleeding, with less of a need for rescue surgery.

8789380|t|Participation of 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors in the contraction of human temporal artery by 5-hydroxytryptamine and related drugs.
8789380|a|1. We investigated the hypothesis that, as in some other large human arteries, 5-HT-induced contraction of the temporal artery is mediated through two co-existing receptor populations, 5-HT1-like- and 5-HT2A. Temporal arterial segments were obtained from patients undergoing brain surgery and rings prepared set up to contract with 5-HT and related agents. Fractions of maximal 5-HT responses mediated through 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2A receptors, f1 and f2 = 1-f1, were estimated by use of the 5-HT2A-selective antagonist ketanserin. 2. In rings with intact endothelium 5-HT evoked contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.0. Ketanserin (10-1000 nM) antagonized part of the 5-HT-induced contractions. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M of 6.9 and f1 of 0.17 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 6.4 and f1 of 0.20 (1000 nM ketanserin). 3. In rings with endothelial function attenuated by enzymatic treatment, 5-HT caused contractions with a -log EC50, M of 7.2 that were partially blocked by ketanserin. Ketanserin-resistant components of 5-HT-induced contractions were found with -log EC50, M 7.4 and f1 of 0.16 (100 nM ketanserin) and -log EC50, M of 7.5 and f1 of 0.14 (1000 nM ketanserin). 4. The ketanserin-resistant component of 5-HT-evoked contraction was blocked by methiothepin (100-1000 nM) consistent with mediation through 5-HT1-like receptors. 5. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT1-like-selective agonist, sumatriptan, caused small contractions with a -log EC50, M of 6.5 and intrinsic activity of 0.21 with respect to 5-HT that were resistant to blockade by 1000 nM ketanserin but antagonized by 100 nM methiothepin. 6. In rings with intact endothelium the 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist SK&F 103829 (2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-8[methyl sulphonyl]-1H3-benzazepin-7-ol methensulphonate) contracted rings with a -log EC50, M of 5.0 and an intrinsic activity of 0.49 with respect to 5-HT; the effects were antagonized by ketanserin 1000 nM. 7. We conclude that 80-86% of the maximum 5-HT-evoked contraction of human temporal artery is mediated through 5-HT2A receptors, the remainder through 5-HT1-like-receptors, regardless of whether or not endothelium is functional. The 5-HT1-like-receptors are more likely to be 5-HT1D beta receptors than 5-HT1D alpha receptors and sumatriptan is a full agonist for these receptors. As found in arteries of other species, SK&F 103829 is a partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors of human temporal artery.

1349366|t|Effect of vegetarian soy diet on hyperlipidaemia in nephrotic syndrome.
1349366|a|Nephrotic patients with persistent proteinuria also have various lipid abnormalities that may promote atherosclerosis and more rapid progression of renal disease. We aimed to find out whether dietary manipulation can correct the hyperlipidaemia found in these patients. After a baseline control period of 8 weeks on their usual diets, 20 untreated patients with chronic glomerular diseases, stable long-lasting severe proteinuria (5.9 [SD 3.4] g/24 h) and hyperlipidaemia (mean serum cholesterol 8.69 [3.34] mmol/l) ate a vegetarian soy diet for 8 weeks. The diet was low in fat (28% of total calories) and protein (0.71 [0.36] g/kg ideal body weight daily), cholesterol free, and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (polyunsaturated/saturated ratio 2.5) and in fibre (40 g/day). After the diet period the patients resumed their usual diets for 8 weeks (washout period). During the soy-diet period there were significant falls in serum cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein) and apolipoproteins A and B, but serum triglyceride concentrations did not change. Urinary protein excretion fell significantly. The concentrations of all lipid fractions and the amount of proteinuria tended to return towards baseline values during the washout period. We do not know whether the favourable effect of this dietary manipulation on proteinuria was due to the qualitative or quantitative modifications of dietary protein intake or was a direct consequence of the manipulation of dietary lipid intake.

7805931|t|Mathematical modelling of chemotherapy in HIV infection.
7805931|a|A mathematical model of CD4+ lymphocyte depletion in HIV infection is used to simulate and analyse the effect of AZT treatment. In most cases, permanent administration of AZT is observed to stop the CD4+ lymphocyte count decline and to stimulate their increase up to a new steady-state level, which depends on the intensity of AZT treatment, i.e. AZT dose. Temporary administration of AZT leads only to a temporary increase in CD4+ lymphocyte count. After the treatment is terminated, the count starts to decline again. However, the resulting prolongation of patient's survival exceeds the time interval of AZT administration. Interestingly, the survival prolongation is greater, if the treatment is started at five than at two years after the infection and there is no striking increase in survival time if a dose of AZT inhibiting 75% of HIV proliferation is used instead of a lower one inducing 25% inhibition only.

11165041|t|Interactions of vitamin D analogue CB1093, TNFalpha and ceramide on breast cancer cell apoptosis.
11165041|a|Mechanisms by which vitamin D analogues promote apoptosis in tumour cells are unclear. In this study we have examined possible interactions between the synthetic vitamin D analogue CB1093 and two other known mediators of apoptosis, TNFalpha and ceramide, in MCF-7, T47D and Hs578T breast cancer cells. These studies indicated that cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is involved in CB1093 as well as TNFalpha-mediated cell death. CB1093 promoted both TNFalpha and ceramide-induced c-PLA(2) activation, which was inversely related to loss of cell viability in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells. TNFalpha alone (5-20 ng/ml) failed to induce cytotoxicity and activation of cPLA(2) in T47D cells. However, pretreatment of these cells with CB1093 potentiated C(2)-ceramide-induced cPLA(2) activation and cell death. Treatment with CB1093 alone induced loss of cell viability and DNA fragmentation in all three cell lines by 5 days and these effects were accompanied by activation of cPLA(2). Furthermore, co-treatment with the cPLA(2) inhibitor AACOCF(3) led to partial protection against loss of cell viability induced by CB1093 in Hs578T and T47D cells as well as MCF-7 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented TNFalpha but not C(2)-ceramide and CB1093-mediated release of arachidonic acid and cell death in MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that CB1093 potentiates responsiveness of breast cancer cells to TNFalpha and suggest that ceramide and/or cPLA(2) might be involved as downstream effectors in vitamin D-mediated caspase-independent cell death.

15866552|t|Naltrexone and disulfiram in patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid psychiatric disorders.
15866552|a|BACKGROUND: Disulfiram and naltrexone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of alcoholism, but these agents have not been rigorously evaluated in dually diagnosed individuals. METHOD: Two-hundred and fifty-four patients with an Axis I psychiatric disorder and comorbid alcohol dependence were treated for 12 weeks in an outpatient medication study conducted at three Veterans Administration outpatient clinics. Randomization included assignment to one of four groups: 1) naltrexone alone; 2) placebo alone; 3) (open-label) disulfiram and (blinded) naltrexone; or 4) (open-label) disulfiram and (blinded) placebo. Medication compliance was evaluated using the Microelectric Events Monitoring System. Primary outcomes were measures of alcohol use. Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms, alcohol craving, g-GGT levels and adverse events. RESULTS: There was a high rate of abstinence across groups. Subjects treated with an active medication had significantly more consecutive weeks of abstinence and less craving than those treated with placebo, but there were no significant group differences in other measures of alcohol consumption. There was no advantage of the combination of both medications. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a modest advantage for the use of disulfiram and naltrexone for this group of dually diagnosed alcohol-dependent individuals but did not suggest an advantage in the combination.

12398998|t|Oxaliplatin: results in colorectal carcinoma.
12398998|a|Oxaliplatin, a platinum compound characterized by a diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum carrier ligand, has proven its efficacy in first- and second-line advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Acute reversible and cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy has been observed frequently with oxaliplatin treatment and limits its use. Its synergism with other drugs, as well as its different mechanism of action and toxicity profile make it an attractive candidate for combination studies in CRC. It can be combined safely with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)+/-folinic acid (LV), irinotecan, raltitrexed, multitarget antifolate LY231514 (MTA), and oral 5-FU prodrugs. These combinations confer both an increased response rate compared to that of any single agent and an increased secondary surgical resection of initially unresectable metastases, possibly leading to prolonged survival. In three prospective randomized phase III studies in advanced CRC, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV improved significantly progression-free survival without a significant increase in median survival time and without affecting quality of life, compared to treatment with 5-FU/LV. Ongoing clinical trials will define its role in the adjuvant setting.

24681811|t|Effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in delusional disorders with nonprominent hallucinations and without hallucinations.
24681811|a|The presence of nonprominent hallucinations in delusional disorder (DD) has been accepted by the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. A recent meta-analysis revealed that patients with schizophrenia treated with long-acting atypical antipsychotics showed a significant improvement in psychotic symptoms. However, little research has been conducted on DD. Our goal was to investigate demographic and clinical differences between two subgroups of DD patients, those with nonprominent hallucinations and those without hallucinations, and to determine treatment effectiveness of long-acting antipsychotics in these patients. We conducted a longitudinal observational study with a 6-month follow-up period in a clinical group of 45 DD outpatients. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Personal and Social Performance Scale, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 (HRSD-17) were used for assessment. Age at onset of DD, scores in baseline assessment scales, and drug compliance were included in the analysis as potential confounders. When uncorrected for influencing factors, patients treated with long-acting antipsychotics showed lower scores in PANSS positive and negative subscales. There were no statistically significant clinical subgroup×treatment group interactions for any of the scores in assessment scales at 6 months. After adjustment, patients treated with long-acting antipsychotics showed lower scores in the PANSS negative subscale and a tendency toward improvement in scores in the PANSS positive subscale. Our study suggests that risperidone long-acting injection and paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection may be useful in the treatment of DD patients, specifically those with nonprominent hallucinations.

18371409|t|Thrombopoietin/MPL signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and interaction with the osteoblastic niche.
18371409|a|Maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depends on interaction with their niche. Here we show that the long-term (LT)-HSCs expressing the thrombopoietin (THPO) receptor, MPL, are a quiescent population in adult bone marrow (BM) and are closely associated with THPO-producing osteoblastic cells. THPO/MPL signaling upregulated beta1-integrin and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in HSCs. Furthermore, inhibition and stimulation of THPO/MPL pathway by treatments with anti-MPL neutralizing antibody, AMM2, and with THPO showed reciprocal regulation of quiescence of LT-HSC. AMM2 treatment reduced the number of quiescent LT-HSCs and allowed exogenous HSC engraftment without irradiation. By contrast, exogenous THPO transiently increased quiescent HSC population and subsequently induced HSC proliferation in vivo. Altogether, these observations suggest that THPO/MPL signaling plays a critical role of LT-HSC regulation in the osteoblastic niche.

19669737|a|BACKGROUND: Losartan is used for anti-proteinuric as well as blood pressure effects in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 to active E-3174. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C9 that reduce catalytic activity could reduce clinical benefits. AIM: The study aims were to determine whether CYP2C9 variant alleles (*2 and *3) altered urinary protein excretion, glomerular filtration rate, and blood pressure in Caucasian patients prescribed losartan. METHODS: Differences between baseline and 6-month follow-up outcomes were compared by CYP2C9 genotypes in 59 patients using unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Primary renal disease patients had a trend toward less favorable antiproteinuric response (-31.7 +/- 156 vs. -125 +/- 323%; p = 0.123) when carrying variant alleles. Patients with secondary renal diseases had less favorable diastolic blood pressure (9.8 +/- 16.0 vs. -3.2 +/- 10.6 mmHg; p = 0.043) and systolic blood pressure (16.2 +/- 27.1 vs. -5.5 +/- 17.5 mmHg; p = 0.044) with CYP2C9 variants. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest a possible influence of CYP2C9 genotype on proteinuria and blood pressure in Caucasian CKD patients treated with losartan.

2125938|t|Acipimox stimulates skin blood flow by a cyclo-oxygenase-dependent mechanism.
2125938|a|The blood flow in the skin and the urinary excretion of the PGI2 metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1a (PGI-M) were determined in the nine healthy subjects randomly assigned to double-blind oral treatment with a) placebo and acipimox (AC) 500 mg, b) acetylsalicylic acid 1500 mg and AC 500 mg, or c) placebo and nicotinic acid (NIC) 500 mg, on three different occasions. After treatment with placebo and AC there was a transient increase in the skin blood flow, up to about four-times the basal level, and a concomitant increase in skin temperature. After acetylsalicylic acid and AC no increase in skin flow rate or temperature was found. Urinary excretion of PGI-M was insignificantly increased by AC, but fell after acetylsalicylic acid pretreatment. NIC elicited a more marked increase in skin blood flow than AC, and in parallel the urinary excretion of PGI-M was more than doubled. It is concluded that cutaneous flushing induced by AC is cyclo-oxygenase dependent. In comparison to NIC, however, AC appears as a weak stimulant of vascular prostacyclin formation.

12075737|t|Functional monitoring of anthracycline cardiotoxicity: a prospective, blinded, long-term observational study of outcome in 120 patients.
12075737|a|BACKGROUND: With increasing doses the highly tumoricidal anthracycline drugs cause heart damage. Based on empirical drug limitations about 10-15% of patients will develop congestive heart failure (CHF) with a mortality of -50% within 2 years on digitalo-diuretic therapy alone. To avoid CHF there is a consensus recommendation that cardiac function should be monitored in close connection with anthracycline administration. As no prospective studies in a larger series have been performed, these recommendations are based on retrospective data on small numbers of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective, blinded observational study 120 patients with advanced breast cancer were followed before, during, and a median 3 years after treatment with epirubicin. They had 604 serial radionuclide measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that were stored without calculations except in patients who developed a well-defined CHF. RESULTS: Anthracycline cardiotoxicity was closely correlated with the cumulative dose, with a great variability in individual susceptibility and a dramatic increase with advancing age. With a delayed onset of 3 months or more, epirubicin induced a threatening, slowly progressive deterioration of cardiac function continuing years after treatment. An actuarial estimation of 59% of the patients experienced a 25% relative reduction in LVEF 3 years after 850-1000 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 20% had deteriorated into a CHF. The patients did not spontaneously regain cardiac function whereas continued therapy with a circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for more than 3 months caused a remarkably potent and long-lasting recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the displaced cardiotoxic manifestation, functional monitoring in close connection with anthracycline administration appears to be a poorly effective method while later monitoring is essential. Current monitoring recommendations should therefore be revised.

11814097|t|Effects of hemoperfusion on serum cardiac troponin T concentrations using polymyxin B-immobilized fibers in septic patients undergoing hemodialysis.
11814097|a|We investigated whether serum cardiac troponin T levels are altered in septic patients undergoing hemodialysis and whether polyinyxin B-immobilized fiber (PMX-F) treatment affects these levels. Fourteen heinodialysis patients with sepsis, 14 hemodialysis patients without sepsis, and 12 age matched healthy controls were included in this study. Cardiac troponin T levels in hemodialysis patients with sepsis (0.56+/-0.28 microg/L) were higher than levels in hemodialysis patients without sepsis (0.16+/-0.06 microg/L, p < 0.01) and healthy control subjects (0.03+/-0.01 microg/L, p < 0.001). The 14 hemodialysis patients with sepsis were randomly assigned to one of two treatment approaches: PMX-F treatment (n = 7) or conventional treatment (n = 7). Plasma endotoxin levels were significantly reduced from 46.6+/-17.8 pg/mI to 8.2+/-2.4 pg/ml, p < 0.01, in patients treated with PMX-F, and serum cardiac troponin T levels were also reduced from 0.62+/-0.30 microg/L to 0.26 = 0.12 microg/L, p < 0.05. Cardiac troponin T levels were unchanged in patients under conventional treatment. These data suggest that cardiac troponin T is indeed elevated in septic patients undergoing hemodialysis and niay reflect subclinical myocardial cell damage. PMX-F is effective in reducing myocardial damage, in part, due to reducing plasma endotoxin levels.

17904787|t|Effects of capecitabine and vinorelbine on cell proliferation, metabolism and COX2 and p16 expression in breast cancer cell lines and solid tumour tissues.
17904787|a|BACKGROUND: Capecitabine is a recently developed oral antineoplastic prodrug of 5-fluorouracil. It has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, with low incidence of myelosuppression. Vinorelbine, a third generation vinca alkaloid, works by inhibiting mitosis and interfering with cells' ability to synthesize DNA and RNA. The present study investigates the therapeutic value of single use capecitabine on solid tumour tissues in vitro using breast cancer cell lines and as reference. The data is to be compared with the use of vinorelbine which is a conventionally applied drug for advanced breast cancer patients. METHODS: The trucut biopsies of 35 metastatic breast tumour patients were obtained. The tissues were cultured for 24h. Capecitabine and vinorelbine were added according to the corresponding groups to be cultured by another 24h. Plain medium was added for control group. The two cell lines chosen were BT-783 and MB-MDA-231 to act as a reference group. The metabolic rate of the tissues and cell lines were measured by ATP bioluminescence assay and the proliferation rate was measured by WST-1. The level of COX2 and p16 after capecitabine and vinorelbine treatment was assessed with immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed lower metabolic rate in test groups than control in cell lines and tumour tissues. WST-1 showed similar trend in both cell lines. COX2 and p16 staining showed decreases in cell size and number after drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine demonstrated similar inhibitory effects as vinorelbine in breast cancer cell lines and solid tumour tissues at decreasing cell proliferation and metabolism as well as decreasing the expression of metabolic proteins and tumor suppressor genes. Capecitabine also has the added benefits of convenient oral administration and lower cost.

18682458|t|Molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance.
18682458|a|Most patients with asthma are successfully treated with conventional therapy. Nevertheless, there is a small proportion of asthmatic patients, including present cigarette smokers and former cigarette smokers, who fail to respond well to therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) or with supplementary therapy. In addition, high doses of steroids have a minimal effect on the inexorable decline in lung function in COPD patients and only a small effect on reducing exacerbations. GC insensitivity, therefore, presents a profound management problem in these patients. GCs act by binding to a cytosolic GC receptor (GR), which is subsequently activated and is able to translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the GR either binds to DNA and switches on the expression of antiinflammatory genes or acts indirectly to repress the activity of a number of distinct signaling pathways such as nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1. This latter step requires the recruitment of corepressor molecules. Importantly, this latter interaction is mutually repressive in that high levels of NF-kappaB and AP-1 attenuate GR function. A failure to respond may therefore result from reduced GC binding to GR, reduced GR expression, enhanced activation of inflammatory pathways, or lack of corepressor activity. These events can be modulated by oxidative stress, T-helper type 2 cytokines, or high levels of inflammatory mediators, all of which may lead to a reduced clinical outcome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of GR action, and inaction, may lead to the development of new antiinflammatory drugs or may reverse the relative steroid insensitivity that is characteristic of patients with these diseases.

11954856|t|Effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in adult patients with steroid-resistant monophasic or recurrent acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
11954856|a|Randomized Controlled Trials have not let established the best pharmacological management of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM). High dose steroids are usually employed with good results, but in a few cases the clinical outcome is poor. In other patients, particularly those affected by the site restricted ADEM variants (myelitis), the disease shows a recurrent course resembling that of Multiple Sclerosis. We present here five patients, 3 of them affected by classic disseminated encephalomyelitis and 2 by a post infectious myelitis, which showed a good response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) after steroid treatment failure. In our report high dose steroids administration was substantially uneffective in all but one case, who showed a good response only during the first episode. On the contrary IVIg injection (0,4 gr/kg/day) produced a marked functional improvement in all patients starting within the first five days of drug administration and reaching a maximum within three weeks. One patient experienced a good effect nothwithstanding a steady dysability. In all cases, clinical evidence was supported by MRI controls showing improving posttreatment changes.

1828398|t|Mechanisms of rejection during OKT3 therapy: propagation and characterization of CD3 resistant allospecific cytotoxic T cells from a rejecting liver allograft.
1828398|a|Allograft rejection remains the single largest impediment to success in the field of transplantation. While OKT3 therapy has proven to be a significant advancement, many grafts are still lost. Late treatment, subtherapeutic OKT3 levels, anti-OKT3 antibodies, and OKT3-induced class II antigen expression are possible explanations. To determine the mechanism of OKT3 resistant rejection we propagated and characterized infiltrating T cells from the biopsy of a liver transplant patient who was rejecting while on prophylactic OKT3. The T lymphocytes demonstrated allospecific proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL2) production and showed a high degree of cytolysis of donor splenocytes. CD3 epsilon monoclonal antibodies (Mab) in concentrations up to 100 micrograms/ml did not inhibit lysis. In contrast, T lymphocytes derived from rejecting allografts of patients receiving cyclosporine and prednisone were readily inhibited from killing by CD3 epsilon Mab at doses of 1 microgram/ml. Furthermore, allospecific proliferation and IL2 production were not inhibited in the OKT3-treated patient by the addition of CD3 epsilon MaB. Incomplete modulation of the CD3-TCR complex was noted after a 72-hr incubation with CD3 epsilon Mab. The T cells did demonstrate other intact CD3-mediated functions such as a rise in intracellular calcium and CD3-dependent cytotoxicity. These results should alert clinicians that CD3 resistant cytotoxic T cells can emerge during OKT3 therapy and may cause rejection. Immunotherapy that targets additional cell surface structures may be of benefit.

21482024|t|A FGFR2 inhibitor, Ki23057, enhances the chemosensitivity of drug-resistant gastric cancer cells.
21482024|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to clarify the ability of a FGFR2 inhibitor, Ki23057, to enhance the chemosensitivity of drug-resistant gastric cancer cell lines when used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five cancer cell lines resistant to irinotecan (SN38), paclitaxel (PTX), etoposide (VP16), oxaliplatin (OXA), and gemcitabine (GEM) were respectively established from a parent gastric cancer cell line, OCUM-2M, and were named OCUM-2M/SN38, OCUM-2M/PTX, OCUM-2M/VP16, OCUM-2M/OXA, and OCUM-2M/GEM. The effects of the combination of Ki23057 with anticancer drugs on proliferation, apoptosis, and mRNA expression were examined. RESULTS: Ki23057 significantly decreased the IC(50) values of OCUM-2M/SN38, OCUM-2M/PTX, and OCUM-2M/VP16, but not those of OCUM-2M/OXA and OCUM-2M/GEM. Ki23057 significantly enhanced the apoptosis rates induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in both the drug-resistant cell lines and the parental cell line. Ki23057 decreased the ERCC1 expression level in OCUM-2M/SN38, OCUM-2M/PTX, and OCUM-2M/VP16. Ki23057 increased the p53 expression level in OCUM-2M/SN38 and OCUM-2M/PTX, but not in OCUM-2M/VP16. CONCLUSION: The FGFR2 inhibitor Ki23057 might be therapeutically promising for treating drug-resistant gastric cancer cells, especially when used in combination with SN38, PTX, or VP16. The apoptosis process might be the main mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of these combinations. The ERCC1 and p53 genes may play an integral role in the synergism between Ki23057 and chemotherapeutic agents in drug-resistant cell lines.

7568237|t|Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates the secretion of hyaluronic acid by proliferating human vascular smooth muscle cells.
7568237|a|Total glycans from the cell layer and the culture medium of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) that had been cultivated in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were isolated and purified by gel filtration after Pronase and DNase digestion and alkaliborohydride treatment. Measurements of the content of neutral hexoses and uronic acids revealed that PDGF stimulates total glycan synthesis by proliferating VSMC in a linear fashion from 24 h to 72 h of incubation. In contrast, total glycan synthesis by human fibroblasts, epithelial cells, or endothelial cells was not affected by PDGF, indicating cell-type specificity. Chemical, biochemical, and enzymological characterization of the total glycans synthesized by VSMC showed that PDGF stimulates the secretion of a 340-kDa glycan molecule in a time-dependent manner from 24 h to 72 h. This molecule is highly acidic, shares a common structure with hyaluronic acid, and exhibits a potent antiproliferative activity on VSMC. These results suggest that VSMC in response to PDGF are capable of controlling their own growth and migration by the synthesis of a specific form of hyaluronic acid with antiproliferative potency, which may be involved in the regulation of the local inflammatory responses associated with atherosclerosis.

15491708|t|Alcohol and the risk of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
15491708|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between alcohol and the risk of prostate cancer/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a population with a wide range of alcohol consumption, using a hospital-based, case-control study. Data from several epidemiologic studies have allowed us to exclude a strong association between alcohol drinking and prostate cancer risk. However, limited information is available for BPH. Also, it is unclear whether various types of alcoholic beverages may have a different impact on risk. METHODS: We conducted this hospital-based case-control study in Italy between 1991 and 2002. A total of 2663 men younger than 75 years had incident, histologically confirmed prostate carcinoma (1294 cases) or symptomatic obstructive BPH (1369 cases) (maximal flow rate less than 15 mL/s) refractory to medical treatment. A total of 1451 patients younger than 75 years were used as controls. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression models including terms for age, center, education, body mass index, physical activity, and family history of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption showed no consistent association with prostate cancer risk, but a statistically significant inverse trend in risk for BPH. Compared with abstainers, the odds ratio was 0.88 for fewer than three drinks, 0.71 for three to four drinks, 0.79 for five to six drinks, and 0.65 for seven or more drinks per day. The patterns of risk were similar with reference to different alcoholic beverages. The inverse relation between elevated alcohol consumption and BPH was apparently stronger in subjects with a lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol drinking is unrelated to prostate cancer risk. The inverse relationship with BPH may be related to the hormonal correlates (ie, lower androgen levels) of heavy alcohol drinkers.

15599331|t|Severe cholestatic jaundice in hyperthyroidism after treatment with 131-iodine.
15599331|a|A 39-year-old white man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of his jaundice and pruritus. The patient was treated with I for diffuse toxic goiter prior to his referral to our hospital. Clinical examination and laboratory investigations excluded viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, granulomatous disease, primary biliary disease, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and heart failure. Liver biopsy showed severe intrahepatic and canalicular cholestasis with minimal inflammatory changes. The patient's jaundice promptly resolved with therapy for hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm as bilirubin levels decreased from 35 mg/dL (normal: 0.5-1.2 mg/dL) to 0.4 mg/dL. Thyrotoxicosis can be an uncommon cause of profound cholestasis. Our case differs from all other reports in the literature because of the severity of the cholestasis and its prompt resolution with treatment for thyrotoxicosis.

Activation rate of native plasminogen (Glu-plg) by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), urinary plasminogen activator (u-PA) and single-chain u-PA (scu-PA) was enhanced in the presence of HHS-5 dose dependently up to 10 micrograms/ml. Activation rate of Glu-plg by sct-PA was more enhanced than that by tct-PA in its presence. HHS-5 enhanced the activation of Glu-plg by t-PA or u-PA compared to the activation of Lys-plg. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the enhancement of the hydrolysis of S-2251 by the mixture of Glu-plg, sct-PA and HHS-5 was due to the facilitation of the conversion of Glu-plg to plasmin. HHS-5 only slightly enhanced the amidolytic activity of sct-PA or tct-PA. The enhancement of the activation of plasminogen by t-PA or u-PA was more significant in the presence of HHS-5 than in the presence of chondroitin sulfate C, dextran sulfate or heparin. It is possible that the enhancement of the activation of Glu-plg by activators in the presence of HHS-5 was due to the conformational change of Glu-plg upon interaction with HHS-5.

20713345|t|A comparison of twice-daily biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 and once-daily insulin glargine in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on basal insulin and oral therapy: a randomized, open-label study.
20713345|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 (BIAsp 30) with insulin (glargine) in type 2 diabetic patients who were not maintaining glycemic control on basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs. METHODS: In a 24-week, open-label, parallel-group trial, type 2 diabetic patients who were not maintaining glycemic control on basal insulin (glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn) + oral antidiabetic drugs were randomly assigned to twice-daily BIAsp 30 + metformin or once-daily glargine + metformin + secretagogues (secretagogues were discontinued in the BIAsp 30 arm). RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were randomly assigned to the BIAsp 30 group and 143 patients were randomly assigned to the glargine group. Of 280 patients randomized, 229 (81.8%) completed the study. End-of-trial hemoglobin A1c reductions were -1.3% (BIAsp 30) vs -1.2% (glargine) (treatment difference: 95% confidence interval, -0.06 [-0.32 to 0.20]; P = .657). Of patients taking BIAsp 30, 27.3% reached a hemoglobin A1c level <7.0% compared with 22.0% of patients taking glargine (treatment difference: P = .388). Glucose increment averaged over 3 meals was lower in the BIAsp 30 arm (treatment difference: -17.8 mg/dL, P = .001). Fasting plasma glucose reductions from baseline were -13.8 mg/dL (BIAsp 30) vs -42.5 mg/dL (glargine) (P = .0002). Final minor hypoglycemia rate, insulin dose, and weight change were higher in the BIAsp 30 arm (6.5 vs 3.4 events/patient per year, P<.05; 1.19 vs 0.63 U/kg; and 3.1 vs 1.4 kg, P = .0004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite not receiving secretagogues, patients taking BIAsp 30 + metformin achieved similar hemoglobin A1c levels and lower postprandial plasma glucose compared with those receiving glargine + metformin + secretagogues. The large improvement in the glargine group suggests the patients were not true basal failures at randomization. While switching to BIAsp 30 improves glycemic control in this patient population, remaining on basal insulin and optimizing the dose may be equally effective in the short term.

12511452|t|Analgesic effect of breast feeding in term neonates: randomised controlled trial.
12511452|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether breast feeding is effective for pain relief during venepuncture in term neonates and compare any effect with that of oral glucose combined with a pacifier. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 180 term newborn infants undergoing venepuncture; 45 in each group. INTERVENTIONS: During venepuncture infants were either breast fed (group 1), held in their mother's arms without breast feeding (group 2), given 1 ml of sterile water as placebo (group 3), or given 1 ml of 30% glucose followed by pacifier (group 4). Video recordings of the procedure were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain related behaviours evaluated with two acute pain rating scales: the Douleur AiguÃ« Nouveau-nÃ© scale (range 0 to 10) and the premature infant pain profile scale (range 0 to 18). RESULTS: Median pain scores (interquartile range) for breast feeding, held in mother's arms, placebo, and 30% glucose plus pacifier groups were 1 (0-3), 10 (8.5-10), 10 (7.5-10), and 3 (0-5) with the Douleur AiguÃ« Nouveau-nÃ© scale and 4.5 (2.25-8), 13 (10.5-15), 12 (9-13), and 4 (1-6) with the premature infant pain profile scale. Analysis of variance showed significantly different median pain scores (P<0.0001) among the groups. There were significant reductions in both scores for the breast feeding and glucose plus pacifier groups compared with the other two groups (P<0.0001, two tailed Mann-Whitney U tests between groups). The difference in Douleur AiguÃ« Nouveau-nÃ© scores between breast feeding and glucose plus pacifier groups was not significant (P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Breast feeding effectively reduces response to pain during minor invasive procedure in term neonates.

21615612|t|Composite T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: case report.
21615612|a|This report concerns a unique case of a composite lymphoma composed of T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-LBL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a 72-year-old woman with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and ascites. Laboratory findings showed increased lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor. The biopsy specimen showed replacement of the normal architecture of the lymph nodes by a tumor containing a dual cell population composed of large lymphocytes and medium-sized lymphocytes. Sheets of large lymphocytes often were punctuated by clusters of medium-sized lymphocytes. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis showed a composite lymphoma with both T-LBL and DLBCL. The T-LBL expressed CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD8, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The DLBCL expressed CD19 and CD20, CD23, bcl-2, bcl-6, MUM1 and immunoglobulin k light chain. Polymerase chain reaction detected a monoclonal pattern of T-cell receptor y and immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements in the same specimen. She received eight cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab+cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) therapy and achieved complete remission. She has shown no signs of recurrence 20 months after the diagnosis. We describe here a very unusual and, to the best of our knowledge, an as yet never reported case of a primary composite lymphoma of T-LBL and DLBCL.

16298736|t|Oxygen therapy at low flow causes oxidative stress in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Prevention by N-acetyl cysteine.
16298736|a|Exposure to high oxygen concentration produces toxicity by free radical release. We aimed to study: whether stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients present an unbalance in the blood redox status; the effect of oxygen administration on blood redox balance; the efficacy of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) treatment against the oxidative stress-induced by oxygen administration and whether it is dose-related. To this, 45 stable state III COPD patients were recruited and reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) in erythrocytes and thiol proteins (P-SH) and carbonyl proteins (PC) in both erythrocytes and plasma were evaluated. All COPD patients underwent 2 l/m oxygen for 18 h and NAC at 1200 or 1800 mg/day or placebo for 48 h starting with oxygen administration. Blood samples were collected at basal conditions, after 8 and 18 h of oxygen administration and 24 h after oxygen withdrawal. RESULTS: COPD patients present an unstable redox equilibrium mainly due to plasma sulphydryl protein depletion. Oxygen administration oxidize erythrocyte GSH, decrease P-SH and increase PC levels in both plasma and erythrocytes. NAC administration counteract the oxidative stress and at the highest dose completely prevent protein oxidation. In conclusion, stable state III COPD patients present an unstable redox balance; long term low flow oxygen administration induces systemic oxidative stress, which is prevented by NAC treatment.

23602630|t|Treatment outcomes of human bartonellosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
23602630|a|BACKGROUND: Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, and Bartonella bacilliformis are responsible for the majority of cases of bartonellosis in humans. These species have various unique epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, and treatment approaches. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the treatment for the three most common species of Bartonella in humans. METHODS: We searched electronic databases through August 2011 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the regimens used to treat diseases produced by B. henselae, B. quintana, and B. bacilliformis. Study selection and appraisal were done in duplicate. RESULTS: We found two randomized and seven non-randomized studies at high risk of bias. For cat scratch disease, antibiotics did not significantly affect the cure rate or time to achieve cure. In chronic bacteremia, gentamicin and doxycycline significantly increased the resolution rate. The recommended treatment was not better than other regimens for infectious endocarditis and bacillary angiomatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical practice for the treatment of bartonellosis relies mostly on expert opinion and antimicrobial susceptibility data. Randomized controlled trials are needed in the field to compare different treatment options.

24251700|t|Trans fatty acids in diets act as a precipitating factor for gut inflammation?
24251700|a|Fatty acids in our daily diet are broadly classified into cis and trans fatty acids (TFAs). TFAs are formed during the manufacturing process of hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine. Modern diets such as deep-fried products, frozen foods, and packaged snacks commonly include large quantities of margarine containing TFAs. Although an increased report in the effects of the diet containing TFAs on a risk factor of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease has been observed in the recent years, influence on intestinal inflammation remains unknown. This review describes pro-inflammatory effects of TFAs in our diary diet on various systemic disorders and also discusses a possible role of TFAs on gut inflammation.

19473104|t|Improving antidepressant drugs: update on recently patented compounds.
19473104|a|BACKGROUND: According to the WHO, depression is a common condition that affects about 121 million people worldwide. Although the pathophysiological origin of this condition is still unknown, most of the known antidepressants enhance the extracellular availability of brain monoamines (serotonin and/or noradrenaline). OBJECTIVE/METHOD: We have searched for the potential drugs and targets addressed in the most recent patents. Hence, we have explored the Patent Database of the European Patent Office using the esp@cenet search engine for the period 2005 - 2008, looking for "anti depressants". In addition, a search in the Medtrack database yielded information on pharmaceutical companies developing compounds as antidepressants, market size and their market prospects. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that, in general, the preferred targets to develop antidepressants continue to be those aiming the serotoninergic system and, in a less extend, the noradrenergic one; but, more particularly, those that aim several targets are preferred due to problems concerning the efficacy of highly selective drugs. Additionally, a small number of new systems are being targeted, such as the melatonergic. However, when looking at the pharma-market and the antidepressants in the pipeline, a new trend is observed in the developing of dual-action drugs that could be used in depression and schizophrenia therapy.

15765454|t|The value of adding sciatic block to continuous femoral block for analgesia after total knee replacement.
15765454|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The benefit of adding a sciatic nerve block to the femoral block to improve analgesia after total knee replacement is controversial. The aim of this study is to address this controversy in a prospective, comparative, and randomized study. METHODS: Patients were allocated randomly to receive a continuous femoral nerve block or continuous blocks of both the femoral and sciatic nerves. Stimulating catheters were used in all cases. A loading dose of 15 mL ropivacaine 0.75% was injected into each catheter, followed by administration of ropivacaine 0.2% (2-5 mL/h infusion via the femoral catheter; bolus 10 mL repeated every 12 hours in the sciatic catheter). The primary outcome was visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0 = no pain, 100 mm = worst pain) in postanesthesia care unit and in the 48-hour period after surgery. The secondary outcomes were amplitude of knee flexion, morphine consumption, and occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: The VAS scores at rest were significantly higher when there was only continuous femoral nerve block than when there was both continuous femoral and sciatic nerve blocks. This difference progressively decreased and disappeared at 36 hours after surgery. The combined femoral and sciatic blocks decreased the morphine consumption by 81% and significantly decreased the occurrence of PONV. CONCLUSION: During the 36 hours immediately after total knee replacement, the combination of continuous femoral and sciatic nerve blocks improves analgesia while decreasing morphine consumption and PONV.

21544810|t|Variations in sex hormone metabolism genes, postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of endometrial cancer.
21544810|a|We investigated whether variants in sex steroid hormone metabolism genes modify the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal non-Hispanic white women. A nested case-control study was conducted within the California Teachers Study (CTS). We genotyped htSNPs in six genes involved in the hormone metabolism in 286 endometrial cancer cases and 488 controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for each haplotype using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age. The strongest interaction was observed between duration of estrogen therapy (ET) use and haplotype 1A in CYP11A1 (p(interaction) = 0.0027; p(interaction) = 0.010 after correcting for multiple testing within each gene). The OR for endometrial cancer per copy of haplotype 1A was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.05-3.96) for long-term ET users and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.69-1.18) for never users. The most significant interaction with estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) was found for two haplotypes on CYP19A1 and EPT use (haplotype 4A, p(interaction) = 0.024 and haplotype 3B, p(interaction) = 0.043). However, neither this interaction, nor the ET or EPT interactions for any other genes, was statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Variations in CYP11A1 may modify the effect of ET use on risk of postmenopausal endometrial cancer; however, larger studies are needed to explore these findings further.

18286835|t|Prevention and treatment of intracranial hypertension.
18286835|a|Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by cranial contents on the dural envelope. It comprises the partial pressures of brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Normal intracranial pressure is somewhere below 10 mmHg; it may increase as a result of traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, Reye's syndrome, hepatic coma, or other pathologies. When ICP increases above 20 mmHg it may damage neurons and jeopardize cerebral perfusion. If such a condition persists, treatment is indicated. Control of ICP requires measurement, which can only be performed invasively. Standard techniques include direct ventricular manometry or measurement in the parenchyma with electronic or fiberoptic devices. Displaying the time course of pressure (high-resolution ICP tonoscopy) allows assessment of the validity of the signal and identification of specific pathological findings, such as A-, B- and C-waves. When ICP is pathologically elevated--at or above 20-25 mmHg--it needs to be lowered. A range of treatment modalities is available and should be applied with consideration of the underlying cause. When intracranial hypertension is caused by hematoma, contusion, tumor, hygroma, hydrocephalus or pneumatocephalus, surgical treatment is indicated. In the absence of a surgically treatable condition, ICP may be controlled by correcting the patient's position, temperature, ventilation or hemodynamics. If intracranial hypertension persists, drainage of CSF via external drainage is most effective. Other first-tier options include induced hypocapnea (hyperventilation; paCO2 < 35 mmHg), hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline) and induced arterial hypertension (CPP concept). When autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is compromised, hyperoncotic treatment aimed at reducing vasogenic edema and intracranial blood volume may be applied. When intracranial hypertension persists, second-tier treatments may be indicated. These include 'forced hyperventilation' (paCO2 < 25 mmHg), barbiturate coma or experimental protocols such as tris buffer, indomethacin or induced hypothermia. The last resort is emergent bilateral decompressive craniectomy; once taken into consideration, it should be performed without undue delay.

10951280|t|Low doses of UVB or UVA induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured human skin cells.
10951280|a|Chromosomal defects are frequently present in malignant and premalignant skin disorders; however, it is not known whether ultraviolet radiation from sunlight plays a role in their induction. To obtain information on the ability of ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B to induce chromosomal aberrations, cultured melanocytes and fibroblasts were exposed to physiologic doses of ultraviolet A or ultraviolet B and, for comparison, to gamma rays. As a measure of chromosomal aberrations, the formation of micronuclei was determined. To obtain sufficient statistical data on induced micronuclei and cell kinetics, a flow cytometry method has been modified and applied. The flow cytometry method analysis is based on staining the DNA with ethidium bromide and the cell membranes with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5,-hexatriene. We observed dose-dependent micronuclei formation after gamma or ultraviolet B irradiation in both cell types and also for ultraviolet A in fibroblasts. The yield of micronuclei induced in fibroblasts by ultraviolet A was only a factor 15 smaller than that induced by ultraviolet B (313 nm). The results indicate that 10 kJ per m2 (equivalent to 1 minimal erythema dose) of ultraviolet B and 150 kJ per m2 of ultraviolet A (0.2 minimal erythema dose) can induce 1% of micronuclei in fibroblasts, equivalent to the induction due to 0.6 Gy of gamma radiation. In conclusion, physiologic doses of sunlight can induce chromosomal aberrations at a level comparable with that observed after exposure to approximately 1 Gy of ionizing radiation. Therefore, sunlight can be considered a potential inducer of chromosomal aberrations in skin cells, which may contribute to skin carcinogenesis.

19737632|t|Association of physical activity and IL-10 levels 20 years after sulfur mustard exposure: Sardasht-Iran cohort study.
19737632|a|IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is important in the regulation of inflammatory processes in different conditions. Sulfur mustard (SM) intoxicated patients are suffering from different inflammatory diseases in their lung, skin and eyes. Physical activity (PA) is reported to control inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory and inducing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our previous study revealed lower PA and more sedentary lifestyle among SM exposed population. This study aimed to determine the relationship of PA with IL-10 production in SM exposed subjects. Baseline, mitogen-induced and the serum levels of IL-10 were evaluated. In a historical cohort study, Sardasht-Iran Cohort Study (SICS), 372 SM exposed participants were studied 20 years after exposure and were compared with 128 unexposed control participants. The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ; developed by WHO) was used to obtain a self-reported measure of physical activity. Whole blood culture supernatants and serum samples were used for IL-10 measurement by ELISA technique. In both the control and exposed groups mitogen-induced IL-10 production was significantly elevated with severity of PA intensity (p<0.05). In the control subjects with moderate PA intensity, the mitogen-induced IL-10 production was higher than the corresponding in the exposed group (p<0.05). In the exposed group, mitogen-induced IL-10 production had significant positive correlation with total PA, total transport PA, total recreational PA and total moderate intensity work (p<0.05). The positive relationship between high PA and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 indicates a need to encourage a more active lifestyle among the SM exposed subjects who have various inflammatory complications.

22810981|t|Differences in erythrocyte folate concentrations in older adults reached steady-state within one year in a two-year, controlled, 1 mg/d folate supplementation trial.
22810981|a|Daily supplementation with folate increases erythrocyte folate concentrations; however, the time to reach steady-state concentrations has not been empirically demonstrated. Previous predictions of time to steady state or time to 90% steady-state concentration, based on modeling changes in erythrocyte folate during short-term trials, range widely from 40 to 86 wk. We sought to determine the time to steady-state erythrocyte folate concentrations following the initiation of daily folate supplementation using data collected from a 2-y, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving 276 participants aged 65 y or older. The daily supplement contained 1 mg of folate. Erythrocyte folate concentrations were measured, using a microbiological assay, at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo. The mean plasma and erythrocyte folate concentrations in the folate-supplemented group were higher than in the placebo group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo (P < 0.001). Adjusted for baseline differences, the difference in erythrocyte folate concentrations between the folate and placebo group at 6 mo was 1.78 µmol/L (95% CI: 1.62-1.95 µmol/L). The difference increased significantly to 2.02 µmol/L (95% CI: 1.85-2.18 µmol/L) at 12 mo. This difference (between the folate and placebo groups) did not significantly change after a further year of folate supplementation; at 18 mo, it was 2.09 µmol/L (95% CI: 1.92-2.27 µmol/L) and at 24 mo it was 1.98 µmol/L (95% CI: 1.18-2.15 µmol/L). Twelve months of daily folate supplementation with 1 mg is sufficient time to cause erythrocyte folate concentrations to reach a new steady state.

15523717|t|First-pass and equilibrium-MRA of the aortoiliac region with a superparamagnetic iron oxide blood pool MR contrast agent (SH U 555 C): results of a human pilot study.
15523717|a|The purpose of this study was to study different doses for first-pass and equilibrium phase MRA of aortoiliac vessels with a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) intravascular MR contrast agent (SH U 555 C) after single i.v. bolus injection. Sixteen healthy volunteers were prospectively enrolled into this single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SHU 555 C was injected as an i.v. bolus at stepwise increased dose levels of 5, 10, 20 and 40 micromol Fe/kg bodyweight (b.w.) corresponding to injection volumes of 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 ml/kg b.w. Serial high-resolution three-dimensional MRA of the aortoiliac vessels was acquired during first-pass and equilibrium, at 6 min intervals up to 42 min after contrast application using a breath-hold three-dimensional FLASH sequence on a 1.5 T scanner. Intravascular enhancement was calculated within the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava and a statistical analysis for significant differences in vessel enhancement was performed during the bolus and equilibrium phases. The visibility of vessels was ranked and effects of potential artifacts on image quality were graded for each time point and dose group. SH U 555 C showed a dose-dependent intravascular enhancement during the observation period (42 min). The highest dose of 40 micromol Fe/kg b.w. revealed the highest image quality during first-pass and equilibrium phases. The intravascular enhancement in the aorta increased dose-dependently from 5 to 40 micromol kg b.w. during first-pass and equilibrium phases (p<0.05). Intravascular signal inhomogeneities were observed at lower doses and decreased with increasing doses. First-pass MRA was diagnostic at doses of 10, 20 and 40 micromol Fe/kg b.w. For equilibrium MRA, a dose of 40 micromol Fe/kg b.w. was considered to be diagnostic. SH U 555 C proved to be a contrast agent with a high T1-effect suitable for both first-pass MRA comparable to gadolinium-enhanced MRA and high resolution equilibrium MRA up to 42 min post-injection (p.i.).

21971007|t|Rasagiline in Parkinson's disease.
21971007|a|It has long been recognized that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors have a role in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline has neuroprotective effects in animal models, mediated partly by its antiapoptotic activity. Rasagiline has been shown to be effective as monotherapy for early PD and as an adjunct to dopaminergic therapy. Clinical trials have also shown putative disease-modifying effects, though rasagiline's potential to alter the long-term course of PD remains controversial. Given the demonstrated benefits of rasagiline, along with its safety and tolerability profile, it has an important role to play in PD therapy.

8494433|t|Pharmacological relaxation of the saphenous vein during harvesting for coronary artery bypass grafting.
8494433|a|Spasm of the saphenous vein frequently occurs during harvesting from the leg and high-pressure distension is required to restore an adequate diameter for grafting. Forceful distention has been shown to damage the intima and media and may predispose to subsequent occlusion of the vein graft. Various pharmacologic vasodilators are capable of relaxing veins; in this study, we carried out a systematic investigation to determine the appropriate agents and concentrations for use during vein graft operations. In organ baths, human saphenous vein segments were contracted with potassium or a thromboxane mimetic, and vasodilator agents were then applied. Glyceryl trinitrate, 7.2 micrograms/mL, or papaverine hydrochloride, 11.9 micrograms/mL, caused 80% to 100% relaxation of contraction induced by potassium or thromboxane. Verapamil, 15.5 micrograms/mL, relaxed the potassium contraction by 100% and the thromboxane contraction by 75%. Comparison of the time course of action showed that glyceryl trinitrate had a rapid onset and a short duration of maximal action, whereas verapamil (like papaverine) had delayed onset and a long duration. A mixture of glyceryl trinitrate and verapamil combined rapid onset with long duration of action. We now use a mixture of glyceryl trinitrate and verapamil (pH 7.4) topically and intraluminally during harvesting of the saphenous vein to provide a relaxed conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting.

20809980|t|Penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose induces G1 arrest and DNA replicative S-phase arrest independently of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B and P53 in human breast cancer cells and is orally active against triple negative xenograft growth.
20809980|a|INTRODUCTION: Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer (BCa) treatment modalities are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and safety. We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-b-D-glucose (PGG) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer (PCa) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest, in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure. We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells, especially those lacking proven druggable targets. METHODS: Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor (PR)- and Her2-regular (triple-negative) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators. To test the in vivo efficacy, female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation. RESULTS: Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest. Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7, in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation, than in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1). PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest. In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition. In vivo, oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro and in vivo data support PGG as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions, especially for a triple negative BCa xenograft model.

17065055|t|Inhibition of the ERK pathway promotes apoptosis induced by 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine in the B-cell leukemia cell line EHEB.
17065055|a|2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) is a nucleoside analogue active in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Although the mechanism of action of CdA has been extensively investigated in leukemic cells, the possibility that this nucleoside analogue interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway has never been explored. In this study, we show that CdA, at concentrations close to the IC50, activated the ERK pathway in the B-cell line EHEB. Because activation of this pathway is assumed to exert anti-apoptotic effect, we combined CdA with inhibitors of the ERK pathway. The latter were found to enhance CdA-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the efficacy of CdA could be strengthened by combination with inhibitors of the ERK pathway.

23638841|t|Potential environmental and human health impacts of rechargeable lithium batteries in electronic waste.
23638841|a|Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; Ï = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; Ï = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; Ï = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; Ï = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials.

14583070|t|Benefit-risk assessment of transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of chronic pain.
14583070|a|Transdermal fentanyl is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of chronic pain caused by malignancy and non-malignant conditions when administered according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Compared with oral opioids, the advantages of transdermal fentanyl include a lower incidence and impact of adverse effects (constipation, nausea and vomiting, and daytime drowsiness), a higher degree of patient satisfaction, improved quality of life, improved convenience and compliance resulting from administration every 72 hours, and decreased use of rescue medication. Transdermal fentanyl is a useful analgesic for cancer patients who are unable to swallow or have gastrointestinal problems. Transdermal fentanyl forms a depot within the upper skin layers before entering the microcirculation. Therapeutic blood levels are attained 12-16 hours after patch application and decrease slowly with a half-life of 16-22 hours following removal. Patients with chronic pain should be titrated to adequate relief with short-acting oral or parenteral opioids prior to the initiation of transdermal fentanyl in order to prevent exacerbations of pain or opioid-related adverse effects. Transdermal fentanyl can then be initiated based on the 24-hour opioid requirement once adequate analgesia has been achieved. The prolonged elimination of transdermal fentanyl can become problematic if patients develop opioid-related adverse effects, especially hypoventilation. Adverse effects do not improve immediately after patch removal and may take many hours to resolve. Patients who experience opioid-related toxicity associated with respiratory depression should be treated immediately with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone and closely monitored for at least 24 hours. Because of the short half-life of naloxone, sequential doses or a continuous infusion of the opioid antagonist may be necessary. Transdermal fentanyl should be administered cautiously to patients with pre-existing conditions such as emphysema that may predispose them to the development of hypoventilation. Transdermal fentanyl is indicated only for patients who require continuous opioid administration for the treatment of chronic pain that cannot be managed with other medications. It is contraindicated in the management of acute and postoperative pain, as pain may decrease more rapidly in these circumstances than fentanyl blood levels can be adjusted, leading to the development of life-threatening hypoventilation. Cognitive and physical impairments such as confusion and abnormal co-ordination can occur with transdermal fentanyl. Therefore, patients should be instructed to refrain from driving or operating machinery immediately following the initiation of transdermal fentanyl, or after any dosage increase. Patients may resume such activities once the absence of these potential adverse effects is documented.

10642416|t|Qualitative assessment of isocyanate skin exposure in auto body shops: a pilot study.
10642416|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the extent of human isocyanate skin exposure in auto body shops and the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. Animal studies have suggested that skin exposure to isocyanates may be an important risk factor for respiratory sensitization leading to asthma. This study provides initial data on hexamethylene diisocyanate skin exposure in three auto body shops. METHODS: Three auto body shops of different size which use different paint systems were examined for the presence of aliphatic isocyanates on environmental surfaces and workers' skin and for breakthrough of personal protective equipment. Qualitative detection of contamination by isocyanates was conducted using a wipe-sampling technique. Assessment focused on the painters and their tasks, although other auto body repairers were also evaluated. RESULTS: Environmental surfaces such as painters' workbenches, spray equipment, and cleaning tools were found contaminated with isocyanates. Painters had frequent contact with contaminated surfaces, often without wearing gloves. Moderate to heavy contamination of some skin surfaces was found with painters from two of the three auto body shops. Latex gloves used for skin protection showed significant penetrations by isocyanates even after a single painting session. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminated environmental surfaces and skin exposure to isocyanates were documented in several auto body shops. Latex gloves were not adequate protection for workers using isocyanate paints. Further research which would better quantify skin exposure, and its potential relationship to respiratory sensitization and asthma is warranted.

18262146|t|Pentoxifylline after conservative surgery for endometriosis: a randomized, controlled trial.
18262146|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes after conservative surgery for endometriosis with and without pentoxifylline and to assess the efficacy of pentoxifylline in preventing recurrence of endometriosis after conservative surgery. DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Women undergoing conservative surgery for endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic conservative surgery for endometriosis was completed by a single surgeon (J.A.T.), and all suspected endometriotic lesions were widely excised using monopolar coagulation and scissors. All specimens were submitted to pathology for confirmation of the diagnosis. Randomization to the treatment or control groups was completed preoperatively in the outpatient surgery unit by drawing colored marbles. A preoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) was completed. After surgery, patients were discharged home with prescriptions for naproxen, hydromorphone, and pentoxifylline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Visual analog scale scoring was completed monthly by each patient, and each patient was seen monthly for review and pelvic examination. Analgesic use was recorded daily using an individual medication log. Ongoing treatment choice after completion of the 3-month follow-up was recorded. The relationship between the group receiving pentoxifylline and the control group as well as analysis of the VAS scores at time of surgery and 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively was determined using a covariate mixed-model ANOVA. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. One patient became pregnant before surgery, and 1 patient's chart was not available for analysis. Of the 47 who underwent conservative surgery for endometriosis, 9 (19%) had no endometriosis noted in the pathology specimens submitted. Two patients withdrew from the trial after surgery, and 2 patients were lost to follow-up after relocating to a different city. Nineteen women completed the 3-month follow-up in the control group, 15 in the group receiving pentoxifylline. The mean age, gravidity, parity, body mass index, previous surgery for endometriosis, menstrual cycle, and preoperative analgesic use did not differ significantly between the control and treatment groups. The time to complete the conservative surgery did not vary between the 2 groups. There were no intraoperative complications: two patients were admitted postoperatively, one for nausea and vomiting, one for pain that resolved 24 hours after admission. The VAS scores did not differ at the time of surgery; and in both the control and the pentoxifylline groups, there was significant improvement at each monthly interval (p <.05). The patients receiving pentoxifylline had significantly better VAS scores at 2 and 3 months after surgery (p <.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery for endometriosis resulted in improved VAS scores at 2 and 3 months after the procedure when compared with patients having conservative surgery only. The longer-term use of pentoxifylline after conservative surgery may improve long-term outcomes after surgical treatment for endometriosis.

19214395|t|Mutagenic and genotoxic effects of cis-(dichloro)tetraammineruthenium(III) chloride on human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
19214395|a|Chemotherapeutic agents play an important role in cancer treatment mostly due their systemic action on human organism allowing access to liquid tumors and even metastases. Among these drugs, ruthenium compounds have been showing promising results to treat tumors and represent an important development of new antitumor therapy. This study presents the evaluation of cis-(dichloro)tetraammineruthenium(III) chloride, cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl, genotoxic effects using human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro. Mitotic index (MI), chromosome aberrations (CA), and DNA damage using the comet assay were analyzed. MI in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures treated with 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 microg mL(-1) cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl were 5.9%, 4.6%, 3.9%, and 0%, respectively. Doxorubicin chloridate was used as the positive control. CA derived from 1, 10, and 100 microg mL(-1) concentrations were defined as spontaneous when compared with the negative control, and at the concentration of 1,000 microg mL(-1), the cell cycle was inhibited (IM = 0%). Results obtained for the comet assay using cis-[RuCl(2)(NH(3))(4)]Cl suggest that this compound has no genotoxic activity against cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes.

24675421|t|Retaining MKP1 expression and attenuating JNK-mediated apoptosis by RIP1 for cisplatin resistance through miR-940 inhibition.
24675421|a|The elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms is important to improve cancer patient survival. In this report, we investigated the role and mechanism through which receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a mediator in cell survival and death signaling, participates in cancer's response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, knockdown of RIP1 substantially increased cisplatin-induced apoptotic cytotoxicity, which was associated with robust JNK activation. The expression of the JNK inactivating phosphatase, MKP1, was substantially reduced in RIP1 knockdown cells. Although MKP1 protein stability was not altered by RIP1 suppression, the synthesis rate of MKP1 was dramatically reduced in RIP1-suppressed cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of miR-940 was substantially increased in RIP1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of miR-940 restored MKP1 expression and attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, ectopic expression of MKP1 effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced JNK activation and cytotoxicity. In addition, activation of the JNK upstream signaling kinase, MKK4, was also potentiated in RIP1 knockdown cells. Altogether, our results suggest that RIP1 contributes to cisplatin resistance by suppressing JNK activation that involves releasing miR-940-mediated inhibition of MKP1 and suppressing activation of MKK4. Intervention targeting the RIP1/miR-940/MKP1/JNK pathway may be used to sensitize platinum-based chemotherapy.

1358936|t|Longitudinal study of psychotropic drug use by elderly nursing home residents.
1358936|a|In this longitudinal study of patterns of use of psychotropic drugs by a cohort of elderly nursing home residents (N = 5,752), drug use was examined upon admission, 3 months later, and at discharge/end of study. At each time point, 17% of the cohort used neuroleptics. Half of the subjects discontinued neuroleptics at each time point; however, a similar number were initiated on the drug. Benzodiazepines were used by 21%, 15%, and 15% at each of the three time points, respectively. Twice as many people were taken off benzodiazepines as initiated on them following admission. The 5% rate of antidepressant use was constant across the three time periods, although only half of those who took antidepressants upon admission were also taking them upon discharge/end of study. The amount of change due to discontinuation of these drugs and adjustment in dosage levels challenges the stereotype of the "neglected psychotropic drug user" in nursing homes.

16002636|t|polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (ADA) therapy provides temporary immune reconstitution to a child with delayed-onset ADA deficiency.
16002636|a|We describe the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (ADA) replacement therapy on lymphocyte counts, activation, apoptosis, proliferation, and cytokine secretion in a 14-month-old girl with "delayed-onset" ADA deficiency and marked immunodysregulation. Pretreatment lymphopenia affected T cells (CD4, 150/microl; CD8, 459/microl), B cells (16/microl), and NK cells (55/microl). T cells were uniformly activated and largely apoptotic (CD4, 59%; CD8, 82%); and T-cell-dependent cytokine levels in plasma were elevated, including the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2; 26 pg/ml), IL-4 (81 pg/ml), IL-5 (46 pg/ml), gamma interferon (1,430 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (210 pg/ml), and IL-10 (168 pg/ml). Mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells show reduced IL-2 secretion and proliferation. During the first 5 months of therapy there was clinical improvement and partial immune reconstitution, with nearly normal lymphocyte subset numbers, reduced T-cell activation and CD4-cell apoptosis, and decreased plasma cytokine levels. In parallel, IL-2 secretion and the lymphocyte mitogenic response improved. Between 4 and 7 months, immunoglobulin G antibodies to bovine ADA developed and resulted in the complete reversal of immune recovery.

1742888|t|Episodic nocturnal hypoxia and nasal packs.
1742888|a|Nasal obstruction influences respiration during sleep and nasal packs may cause obstructive sleep apnoea. In order to investigate this, the perioperative oxygen saturation was monitored for 3 nights with continuous pulse oximetry in 12 patients, who had bilateral nasal packs after septoplasty. A significant increase in the number of nocturnal episodes of hypoxia and a significant prolongation of the mean duration of the individual hypoxic periods were demonstrated during the first and the second post-operative nights. The clinical significance of these results is as yet unknown, but the use of partial nasal packing in septoplasty is advocated. Further investigations of nocturnal oxygen desaturation and design of nasal packs, securing the post-operative nasal airway, are needed.

24085765|t|Eradicating acute myeloid leukemia in a Mll(PTD/wt):Flt3(ITD/wt) murine model: a path to novel therapeutic approaches for human disease.
24085765|a|The coexpression of the MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD) and the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations associate with a poor outcome in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In mice, a double knock-in (dKI) of Mll(PTD/wt) and Flt3(ITD/wt) mutations induces spontaneous AML with an increase in DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, 3a, and 3b) and global DNA methylation index, thereby recapitulating its human AML counterpart. We determined that a regulator of Dnmts, miR-29b, is downregulated in bone marrow of dKI AML mice. Bortezomib exerted a dose-dependent increase in miR-29b expression in AML blasts ex vivo, followed by decreased Dnmts, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis. In vivo, bortezomib was not active against dKI AML, yet liposomal-encapsulated bortezomib, as a single agent, reversed downregulation of miR-29b in vivo and induced a long-term (90-day) disease-free remission in 80% of dKI AML mice that exhibited high leukemic burden at the start of therapy, yet showed no signs of relapse at autopsy. Taken together, these data support that liposomal bortezomib, as a single agent, eradicates Mll(PTD/wt):Flt3(ITD/wt) AML in mouse and may represent a powerful and potentially curative approach to high-risk human disease.

18341667|t|Noninvasive biophysical assessments of the efficacy of a moisturizing cosmetic cream base for patients with atopic dermatitis during different seasons.
18341667|a|BACKGROUND: The use of emollients is recommended for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) to maintain improved condition. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain objectively the effectiveness of a moisturizing cream for patients with AD during different seasons. METHODS: We conducted clinical evaluations, noninvasive biophysical measurements and biochemical analyses of the stratum corneum (SC) components of the volar forearm skin of 23 patients with AD after a moisturizer was applied twice daily for 4 weeks. The moisturizer was formulated according to the consensus of cosmetic scientists belonging to major Japanese cosmetic companies. The nontreated forearm served as a control. RESULTS: After using the moisturizer treatment, the hydration of the SC significantly increased together with a decrease in the desquamation measurements and an improvement in the regularity of skin surface corneocytes. An improvement was observed in the SC barrier function in winter, but was achieved only after 4 weeks in late spring during which time there even occurred exacerbation of skin conditions in three patients. With use of the moisturizer treatment, we found no change in the SC content of free amino acids or ceramides, the ratio of interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist to IL-1alpha, the ratio of immature to mature cornified envelopes, the size of the corneocytes or the emergence of parakeratotic cells in the skin surface corneocytes. CONCLUSION: Treatment with an adequate moisturizer is beneficial for the dry skin of patients with AD during the dry, cold season but it does not influence the impaired SC barrier function as effectively in the less arid season.

10468898|t|The effects of testosterone on osteoporosis in men.
10468898|a|Although the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in men is multi-factorial, testosterone is known to play an important role in the maintenance of the male skeleton. This role, however, appears complicated as it may be mediated in part by aromatization to oestradiol. Testosterone replacement therapy improves bone density in men with hypogonadal osteoporosis, particularly if the epiphyses are still open. There is no well-established treatment for idiopathic osteoporosis in men, but testosterone supplementation may prove to be useful. Further studies are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this treatment in eugonadal men with osteoporosis.

24917086|t|Effects of camptothecin derivatives and topoisomerase dual inhibitors on Trypanosoma cruzi growth and ultrastructure.
24917086|a|BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease that is an endemic disease in Latin America and affects about 8 million people. This parasite belongs to the Trypanosomatidae family which contains a single mitochondrion with an enlarged region, named kinetoplast that harbors the mitochondrial DNA (kDNA). The kinetoplast and the nucleus present a great variety of essential enzymes involved in DNA replication and topology, including DNA topoisomerases. Such enzymes are considered to be promising molecular targets for cancer treatment and for antiparasitic chemotherapy. In this work, the proliferation and ultrastructure of T. cruzi epimastigotes were evaluated after treatment with eukaryotic topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as topotecan and irinotecan, as well as with dual inhibitors (compounds that block eukaryotic topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II activities), such as baicalein, luteolin and evodiamine. Previous studies have shown that such inhibitors were able to block the growth of tumor cells, however most of them have never been tested on trypanosomatids. RESULTS: Considering the effects of topoisomerase I inhibitors, our results showed that topotecan decreased cell proliferation and caused unpacking of nuclear heterochromatin, however none of these alterations were observed after treatment with irinotecan. The dual inhibitors baicalein and evodiamine decreased cell growth; however the nuclear and kinetoplast ultrastructures were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data showed that camptothecin is more efficient than its derivatives in decreasing T. cruzi proliferation. Furthermore, we conclude that drugs pertaining to a certain class of topoisomerase inhibitors may present different efficiencies as chemotherapeutical agents.

20377427|t|Natural polymorphisms of integrase among HIV type 1-infected South African patients.
20377427|a|An HIV-1 subtype C specific assay was established for integrase genotyping from 51 integrase inhibitor-naive patient plasma samples and 22 antiretroviral drug-naive primary viral isolates from South Africa. Seventy-one of the 73 samples were classified as HIV-1 subtype C and two samples were unique AC and CG recombinants in integrase. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed there were no primary mutations (Y143R/C/H, Q148H/R/K, and N155H/S) associated with reduced susceptibility to the integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir. However, one sample had the T97A mutation, three samples had the E157Q and V165I mutations, and the majority of samples contained the polymorphic mutation V72I. The expected finding of no major integrase mutations conferring resistance to integrase inhibitors suggests that this new antiretroviral drug class will be effective in our region where HIV-1 subtype C predominates. However, the impact of E157Q and other naturally occurring polymorphisms warrants further phenotypic investigation.

10775525|t|Parent-of-origin specific histone acetylation and reactivation of a key imprinted gene locus in Prader-Willi syndrome.
10775525|a|To examine the chromatin basis of imprinting in chromosome 15q11-q13, we have investigated the status of histone acetylation of the SNURF-SNRPN locus, which is a key imprinted gene locus in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that the unmethylated CpG island of the active, paternally derived allele of SNURF-SNRPN was associated with acetylated histones, whereas the methylated maternally derived, inactive allele was specifically hypoacetylated. The body of the SNURF-SNRPN gene was associated with acetylated histones on both alleles. Furthermore, treatment of PWS cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) induced demethylation of the SNURF-SNRPN CpG island and restoration of gene expression on the maternal allele. The reactivation was associated with increased H4 acetylation but not with H3 acetylation at the SNURF-SNRPN CpG island. These findings indicate that (1) a significant role for histone deacetylation in gene silencing is associated with imprinting in 15q11-q13 and (2) silenced genes in PWS can be reactivated by drug treatment.

21312292|t|Efficacy of reboxetine in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
21312292|a|OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of reboxetine, a specific noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: In a double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the efficacy of 8   mg/day of reboxetine (twice daily) was compared with placebo in 40 adults diagnosed with ADHD during 6 weeks. The measures were Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Report, Screening Version (CAARS-S, SV), Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales, Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S), and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). RESULTS: There was a main effect of time and significant time X treatment (reboxetine vs. placebo) interaction on CAARS subscales and CGI scores which decreased along the study (p   <   0.01). There was also a main effect of time and time X treatment interaction on GAF score which increased at the end point of the study (p   <   0.01). In terms of Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales there was just a main effect of time on Hamilton Depression Scale (p   <   0.01). Irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and dry mouth were the common side effects of reboxetine. CONCLUSION: Reboxetine could be used and tolerated as an effective treatment for adults with ADHD.

21323396|t|Asenapine: a review of its use in the management of mania in adults with bipolar I disorder.
21323396|a|Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent available in sublingual formulations (5 or 10 mg) and indicated in the US (Saphris) for the acute treatment, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, of manic and mixed episodes and in the EU (Sycrest) for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes, in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. In two large (both n = 480), well designed, 3-week trials in adult patients with bipolar I disorder, asenapine monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo at improving mania symptoms, as assessed using the Young Mania Rating Scale total score (YMRS; primary endpoint), with significant differences between the asenapine and placebo groups occurring after 2 days of treatment. In both trials, Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) scale mania severity scores exceeded those of placebo. In one trial, response and remission rates exceeded those of placebo. In a 9-week extension study that recruited completers from the monotherapy trials, there were no significant differences between asenapine and olanzapine groups in terms in Montgomery-Ãsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, CGI-BP mania severity scores, YMRS response rates or YMRS remission rates during the extension phase. In the extension study, the efficacy of asenapine monotherapy appeared to be maintained over 40 weeks (total treatment duration of 52 weeks). In a 12-week trial of asenapine as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, asenapine was more effective than placebo in improving manic symptoms, based on the difference between groups in the YMRS total score at week 3 (primary endpoint). Most adverse events associated with asenapine were of mild to moderate severity, with <7% of asenapine recipients experiencing serious adverse events (vs 7% with placebo). In a pooled analysis of the monotherapy trials, the most common adverse events (occurring in >=  5% of patients and at twice the incidence of placebo) reported during acute phase asenapine monotherapy for bipolar mania were somnolence, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS, other than akathisia) and increased bodyweight, which were similar in nature to those occurring during longer-term monotherapy with asenapine. EPS did not worsen in severity during longer-term asenapine monotherapy. Asenapine had minimal effects on plasma glucose, lipid and prolactin levels over both short- and longer-term treatment periods, and had little pro-arrhythmogenic potential. Further active comparator trials and longer-term tolerability and safety data are required. In the meantime, asenapine is a further option for the management of manic and/or mixed symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder and may be of particular value for patients who are at high risk for metabolic abnormalities.

10420210|t|The role of past intake of vitamin E in early cataract changes.
10420210|a|PURPOSE: We examined the association between prior supplementation of vitamin E and early cataract changes in volunteers currently enrolled in the cross-sectional VECAT study. The Vitamin E and Cataract Prevention Study (VECAT) is a clinical trial currently in progress, designed to assess the affect of vitamin E supplementation on the development and progression of cataract and age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: A history of vitamin E supplementation was ascertained through a self-administered questionnaire that was mailed to each of the 1,111 participants who were enrolled at the time in the prospective VECAT Study. RESULTS: With a 99% response rate, we found that 26% of participants reported prior supplementation of vitamin E. Only 8.8% of these participants took supplementation greater than the recommended daily intake (RDI) of 10 mg/day. Of these 26%, 57% took supplementation in the form of multivitamins as opposed to a vitamin E supplement on its own. The range of supplement intake ranged from as little as 0.1 mg/day to a maximum of 55 mg/day. A statistically significant association was found between prior supplementation and the absence of cortical opacity (OR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.28-0.83), after adjusting for age. The levels of nuclear opacity (NO) were not statistically different between those who reported intake and those with no prior vitamin E supplementation. CONCLUSION: Prior vitamin E supplementation may protect VECAT participants from developing at least early cortical cataracts. No apparent protective role in terms of nuclear opacities and nuclear color was found regardless of the level, regularity or duration of intake.

7817998|t|Activation of intestinal Na-K-2Cl cotransport by 5'-AMP requires F-actin remodeling.
7817998|a|BACKGROUND: Although cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent intestinal chloride ion (Cl-) secretion is regulated primarily at the level of apical Cl- channels, cAMP also elicits basolateral microfilament remodeling and activates basolateral sodium-potassium-2 chloride (Na-K-2Cl) cotransport. Without these additional events, secretion is inhibited. However, it is unclear whether microfilament-dependent activation of Na-K-2Cl cotransport is a direct effect of cAMP or a secondary response to the opening of apical Cl- channels. METHODS: Using the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, we examined Cl- secretion elicited by 5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AMP), a novel agonist that activates apical Cl- channels without elevation of intracellular cAMP. RESULTS: 5'-AMP was found to activate basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport, but such regulation was abolished by the actin stabilizer, phalloidin. CONCLUSIONS: Basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport appears to be regulated, at least in part, as an indirect response to activation of apical Cl- channels, a pathway of regulation which may require cytoskeletal remodeling.

16897660|t|Rates of disease progression according to initial highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen: a collaborative analysis of 12 prospective cohort studies.
16897660|a|BACKGROUND: No large clinical end-point trials have been conducted comparing regimens among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive persons starting antiretroviral therapy. We examined clinical progression according to initial regimen in the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration, which is based on 12 European and North American cohort studies. METHODS: We analyzed progression to death from any cause and to AIDS or death (AIDS/death), comparing efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), nelfinavir, idinavir, ritonavir (RTV), RTV-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs), saquinavir, and abacavir. We also compared nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor pairs: zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC), stavudine (D4T)/3TC, D4T/didanosine (DDI), and others. RESULTS: A total of 17,666 treatment-naive patients, 55,622 person-years at risk, 1,617 new AIDS events, and 895 deaths were analyzed. Compared with EFV, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for AIDS/death was 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.60) for NVP, 1.31 (95% CI, 1.01-1.71) for RTV, and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.15-1.81) for RTV-boosted PIs. For death, the adjusted HR for NVP was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.16-2.36). The adjusted HR for death for D4T/3TC was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.14-1.59), compared with AZT/3TC. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes may vary across initial regimens. Results are observational and may have been affected by bias due to unmeasured or residual confounding. There is a need for large, randomized, clinical end-point trials.

7879933|t|Comparison of the neuromuscular blocking effect of atracurium and vecuronium on the adductor pollicis and the geniohyoid muscle in humans.
7879933|a|BACKGROUND: Residual paralysis of suprahyoid muscles may occur when the adductor pollicis response has completely recovered after the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent. The response of the geniohyoid muscle to intubating doses of muscle relaxants is evaluated and compared to that of adductor pollicis. METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were given 5-7 mg.kg-1 thiopental and 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl intravenously for induction of anesthesia. Eight (half) patients then received 0.5 mg.kg-1 atracurium, and the other eight received 0.1 mg.kg-1 vecuronium. The evoked response (twitch height, TH) of the adductor pollicis was monitored by measuring the integrated electromyographic response (AP EMG) on one limb and the mechanical response, using a force transducer (AP force), on the other. The activity of geniohyoid muscle (GH EMG) was measured using submental percutaneous electrodes. The following variables were measured: maximal TH depression; onset time for neuromuscular blockade to 50%, 90%, and maximal TH depression (OT50, OT90, and OTmax); times between administration of neuromuscular blocking agent and TH recovery to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of control; and time for return of train-of-four ratio to return to 0.7. RESULTS: The principal findings were (1) OTmax was significantly (P < 0.01) shorter for geniohyoid than for adductor pollicis after either atracurium or vecuronium (OTmax was 216, 256, and 175 s for AP force, AP EMG, and GH EMG, with atracurium and 181, 199, and 144 s with vecuronium, respectively), and (2) the evoked EMG of geniohyoid recovered at the same speed as the EMG of adductor pollicis after an intubating dose of atracurium or vecuronium (recovery of TH to 75% of control at 50, 48, 42 min with AP force, AP EMG, and GH EMG with atracurium and 46, 45, and 42 min with vecuronium, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Once the adductor pollicis response has returned to normal values after a single intubating dose of atracurium or vecuronium, the risk of residual depression of the TH of the geniohyoid muscle, one of the principal muscles contributing to airway patency, appears unlikely.

21263048|t|Emergence of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after prolonged treatment of cystic fibrosis patients in Cleveland, Ohio.
21263048|a|Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LRSA) isolates were monitored from 2000 to 2009 in Cleveland, OH. LRSA first emerged in 2004 only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 11 LRSA-infected CF patients being identified by 2009. LRSA was isolated from 8 of 77 CF patients with S. aureus respiratory tract infection treated with LZD from 2000 to 2006. Analysis of clinical data showed that the 8 CF patients with LRSA received more LZD courses (18.8 versus 5.9; P = 0.001) for a longer duration (546.5 versus 211.9 days; P < 0.001) and had extended periods of exposure to LZD (83.1 versus 30.1 days/year; P < 0.001) than the 69 with LZD-susceptible isolates. Five LRSA isolates included in the clinical analysis (2000 to 2006) and three collected in 2009 were available for molecular studies. Genotyping by repetitive extrapalindromic PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that seven of these eight LRSA strains from unique patients were genetically similar. By multilocus sequence typing, all LRSA isolates were included in clonal complex 5 (seven of sequence type 5 [ST5] and one of ST1788, a new single-locus variant of ST5). However, seven different variants were identified by spa typing. According to the Escherichia coli numbering system, seven LRSA isolates contained a G2576T mutation (G2603T, S. aureus numbering) in one to four of the five copies of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes. One strain also contained a mutation (C2461T, E. coli numbering) not previously reported. Two strains, including one without domain V mutations, possessed single amino acid substitutions (Gly152Asp or Gly139Arg) in the ribosomal protein L3 of the peptidyltransferase center, substitutions not previously reported in clinical isolates. Emergence of LRSA is a serious concern for CF patients who undergo prolonged courses of LZD therapy.

24779190|t|Paracetamol: mechanism of action, applications and safety concern.
24779190|a|Paracetamol/acetaminophen is one of the most popular and most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drugs around the world, available without a prescription, both in mono- and multi-component preparations. It is the drug of choice in patients that cannot be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as people with bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer disease, hemophilia, salicylate-sensitized people, children under 12 years of age, pregnant or breastfeeding women. It is recommended as a first-line treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. The mechanism of action is complex and includes the effects of both the peripheral (COX inhibition), and central (COX, serotonergic descending neuronal pathway, L-arginine/NO pathway, cannabinoid system) antinociception processes and "redox" mechanism. Paracetamol is well tolerated drug and produces few side effects from the gastrointestinal tract, however, despite that, every year, has seen a steadily increasing number of registered cases of paracetamol-induced liver intoxication all over the world. Given the growing problem of the safety of acetaminophen is questioned the validity of the sale of the drug without a prescription. This work, in conjunction with the latest reports on the mechanism of action of paracetamol, trying to point out that it is not a panacea devoid of side effects, and indeed, especially when is taken regularly and in large doses (> 4 g/day), there is a risk of serious side effects.

23222202|t|Polymorphisms in the methotrexate transport pathway: a new tool for MTX plasma level prediction in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
23222202|a|OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component of therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment with MTX often causes toxicity, which can necessitate dose reduction or treatment cessation. Interindividual differences in adverse reactions can be due to different factors, including polymorphisms in key genes. Recently, we confirmed the association between SLCO1B1 rs11045879 polymorphism and toxicity previously proposed by TreviÃ±o and colleagues. As SLCO1B1 is a transporter involved in MTX elimination, other polymorphisms in genes from this pathway could also have a role in MTX toxicity. The aim of the present study was to analyze in depth the role of polymorphisms in the genes of the MTX transport pathway as putative toxicity predictors in pediatric ALL. METHODS: We analyzed 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 12 transporter genes (SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, SLCO1A2, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, SLC19A1, SLC22A6 and SLC22A8) and their correlation with different toxicity parameters in 151 pediatric ALL patients treated using the LAL/SHOP protocol. RESULTS: A significant association with MTX plasma levels was found for 21 polymorphisms from seven genes and 15 haplotypes. After correction, rs9516519 in ABCC4, rs3740065 in ABCC2, and haplotype GCGGG in ABCC2 remained significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that polymorphisms in ABCC4 and ABCC2 could be novel markers for MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL.

10567788|t|Drug therapy for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Assessment of options.
10567788|a|The efficacy of somatostatin and octreotide have been widely studied in the control of bleeding from oesophageal varices. It has also been suggested that these drugs may be useful for the control of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding, including that from peptic ulcers. In approximately 80% of patients presenting with non-variceal UGI bleeding, haemorrhage ceases spontaneously and does not recur. However, the remaining 20% of patients require active treatment. Results from recent studies have indicated that somatostatin is an effective treatment for the control of non-variceal UGI bleeding in high-risk patients, i.e. those in whom haemorrhage does not cease spontaneously or is likely to recur. In contrast there is no good evidence available at present to support a role for octreotide, histamine (H(2) antagonists) or proton pump inhibitors in this indication. The efficacy of somatostatin in controlling bleeding in patients with non-variceal UGI bleeding at high risk of mortality upon admission, or rebleeding following endoscopy, coupled with an excellent safety and tolerability profile, suggests it may be a valuable therapeutic option in the management of non-variceal bleeding.

24847715|t|A conserved motif in the linker domain of STAT1 transcription factor is required for both recognition and release from high-affinity DNA-binding sites.
24847715|a|Binding to specific palindromic sequences termed gamma-activated sites (GAS) is a hallmark of gene activation by members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family of cytokine-inducible transcription factors. However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved in the signal-dependent finding of target genes by STAT dimers have not yet been very well studied. In this study, we have characterized a sequence motif in the STAT1 linker domain which is highly conserved among the seven human STAT proteins and includes surface-exposed residues in close proximity to the bound DNA. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that a lysine residue in position 567 of the full-length molecule is required for GAS recognition. The substitution of alanine for this residue completely abolished both binding to high-affinity GAS elements and transcriptional activation of endogenous target genes in cells stimulated with interferon-y (IFNy), while the time course of transient nuclear accumulation and tyrosine phosphorylation were virtually unchanged. In contrast, two glutamic acid residues (E559 and E563) on each monomer are important for the dissociation of dimeric STAT1 from DNA and, when mutated to alanine, result in elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 as well as prolonged IFNy-stimulated nuclear accumulation. In conclusion, our data indicate that the kinetics of signal-dependent GAS binding is determined by an array of glutamic acid residues located at the interior surface of the STAT1 dimer. These negatively charged residues appear to align the long axis of the STAT1 dimer in a position perpendicular to the DNA, thereby facilitating the interaction between lysine 567 and the phosphodiester backbone of a bound GAS element, which is a prerequisite for transient gene induction.

2385771|t|Characteristics of left-sided endocarditis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Detroit Medical Center.
2385771|a|Mortality due to left-sided endocarditis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains high despite the therapeutic regimen of high doses of an aminoglycoside plus a beta-lactam antibiotic. In this series, left-sided pseudomonal endocarditis presented as an acute illness refractory to optimal antibiotic therapy. Complications associated with active valvular infection, such as neurologic sequelae, ring and annular abscesses, congestive heart failure, and splenic abscesses, are frequent. The overall morbidity and mortality remain high; however, outcome appears to improve with surgery. Our present data suggest that early valve replacement accompanied by a 6-week course of high doses of a combination of drugs may be the optimal therapy for left-sided pseudomonal endocarditis. This approach not only may prevent serious and potentially lethal complications of the disease but also may cure them.

11874189|t|Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism associated with prelingual deafness due to a connexin 26 gene mutation.
11874189|a|In Mediterranean countries, almost half the incidence of non-syndromic congenital hearing loss is caused by mutations in the gap junction (GJ) connexin 26 gene (GJB2/DFNB1 locus). In this form of deafness the cochlear defect is usually isolated. We describe here the first case of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism in association with this particular cochlear defect. The male patient had moderate deafness inherited from his deaf parents. All family members had a homozygous 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene. This mutation accounts for 70% of all connexin 26 gene mutations. The patient was referred to a paediatric endocrinology unit at 11 years of age for moderate growth retardation. Growth rate was normal until 11 years. The patient then presented delayed puberty (testicular volume 4 ml, penis length 4 cm) and did not undergo the usual pubertal growth spurt. LH and FSH secretory responses to GnRH at the age of 14.5 years (bone age 13.5 years), were: LH baseline level 1.1 IU/l, peak 34 IU/l; FSH baseline level 1.8 IU/l, peak 5.7 IU/l. Testosterone concentration was <0.11 ng/ml. From 11 to 14 years old, testosterone concentration ranged from 0.11 to 0.2 ng/ml. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level was 38.6 ng/ml (normal for Tanner stage I), cortisol 109 ng/ml, and ACTH 37 pg/ml., Karyotype was 46 XY. On MRI analysis, the anterior pituitary and olfactory bulbs were normal. These data were consistent with partial hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism of hypothalamic origin, and the patient was treated with testosterone. This report supports the possible involvement of connexins in puberty initiation. Connexins may play a part in the co-ordination and synchronisation of GnRH release.

18809519|t|Comparison of three different concentrations of ropivacaine for postoperative patient-controlled thoracic epidural analgesia after upper abdominal surgery.
18809519|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported the comparable efficacy of ropivacaine/fentanyl for patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). In our hospital, three different concentrations of ropivacaine solution (0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%) in combination with 1 microg/mL fentanyl were available for PCEA. As some studies have reported a much higher incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects with 0.2% ropivacaine in combination with 4 microg/mL fentanyl, it was our intent to analyze the data of our patients who had received PCEA after upper abdominal surgery. In addition to comparing the analgesic effects and the incidence of motor block and opioid-related side effects of these three different ropivacaine/fentanyl solutions, we also evaluated the workload of our pain staff. The main purpose of our study was to determine which of these three regimens of ropivacaine was most satisfactory with the least workload for the pain service staff. METHODS: In total, 33 patients who had received PCEA after upper abdominal surgery were included in the analysis. The number of patients in each ropivacaine/fentanyl group was 11 (group 1, 0.1% ropivacaine; group 2, 0.15%; group 3, 0.2%). The PCEA device was programmed to deliver a patient-controlled bolus of 2 mL with a lockout time of 20 minutes and background infusion of 5 mL/hr for 72 hours. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, adverse events and the extent of sensory or motor block were recorded 12, 36 and 60 hours after surgery. The total volume of analgesic solution consumed and the frequency of requisite attendance by pain service staff were also recorded. RESULTS: There were no differences among the three groups regarding total consumption. In group 1, VAS scores during ambulation and cough 12 hours postoperatively were significantly higher than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). There was no motor block. Four patients in group 3 suffered from loss of temperature sensation. The overall incidence of adverse events was less than 40%. CONCLUSION: Both thoracic epidural 0.15% and 0.2% ropivacaine provide effective postoperative pain control in combination with fentanyl without motor block. A 0.15% ropivacaine-1 microg/mL fentanyl solution is preferable considering the lower incidence of adverse events.

24785785|t|Evaluation of ranirestat for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.
24785785|a|INTRODUCTION: Pharmacologic maintenance of normoglycemia in diabetes cannot prevent the eventual complications mainly due to protein glycation-induced cell death, dysregulated antioxidant defense and signal transduction in affected tissues. The rate-limiting enzyme of this process, aldose reductase, is therefore a pharmacologic target. To date, nine inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed. Ranirestat has completed two Phase III clinical trials. The objective of this evaluation is to summarize and provide expert opinion on the status of ranirestat with an emphasis on its pharmacokinetics in the context of its potential effects to prevent/treat diabetic complications. AREAS COVERED: A qualitative systematic literature search of PubMed through November 2013 using MeSH terms - aldose reductase inhibitors, diabetic neuropathy, AS-3201, ranirestat, diabetic complications and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics - identified relevant publications limited to human and rodent (mouse and rat) and English-language studies. EXPERT OPINION: Ranirestat is a well-tolerated front-line inhibitor. It reproducibly exhibits some degree of measurable objective beneficial outcomes in diabetic neuropathy. It is the furthest advanced in clinical trials with some depth of supporting preclinical data. Trials in subjects with newly diagnosed neuropathy along with the identification of objective biomarkers/measurements of efficacy will be critical in identifying the real value and effect of ranirestat.

7833498|t|From hemobiology to vascular disease: a review of the potential of gliclazide to influence the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease.
7833498|a|Patients with type II diabetes commonly die from thrombotic vascular disease. Large vessel occlusion due to thrombosis or atherosclerotic stenosis is a process accelerated by diabetes and results in premature death. Diabetic small vessel disease, with its unique microangiopathic process, underlies many of the large vessel changes as well as causing retinopathy and nephropathy. The microangiopathic changes produce a prothrombotic tendency that has been widely reported in type II diabetes. There is reduced endothelial cell production of prostacyclin and the activators of fibrinolysis, together with increased platelet reactivity. In addition, there is increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity and impaired antioxidant defenses particularly in the presence of microvascular disease. The development of many of these abnormalities is associated with poor long-term glycemic control. However, the changes are also seen in atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients where the progression of the disease can be modified by antiplatelet agents and antioxidants. The process of vascular damage is accelerated by diabetes, often due to co-existing disease and aging, although it is not clear that improvement in long-term glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to near to the nondiabetic state reduces the development of small and large vessel disease. Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this observation remains uncertain, protein glycosylation and increased platelet reactivity are implicated and interrelated. Increased oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity may be central to diabetic vascular disease as endothelial cell damage, lipoprotein oxidation, modification of both platelet reactivity and arachidonic acid cascade are all properties of free radicals and their reaction products lipid peroxides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

21974704|t|Role of plasmapheresis performed in hemodialysis units for the treatment of anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitides.
21974704|a|Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity is seen in some systemic necrotizing vasculitides. Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis are among the ANCA-associated systemic vasculitides (AASV) and mortality is very high when renal failure occurs together with alveolar hemorrhage. The role of plasmapheresis in the treatment of these diseases has been studied retrospectively. Twelve patients with AASV who had plasmapheresis together with immunosuppressive medications have been involved. Primary diseases, immunosuppressive protocols, the number of plasmapheresis sessions, the amount of plasma that has been exchanged, urea and creatinine levels before and after treatment, pulmonary findings, the need for hemodialysis, and the outcome of patients were recorded. The mean age of patients was 52.9    ±   18.2   years. Wegener's granulomatosis was diagnosed in seven (58.3%) and microscopic polyangiitis in five (41.7%) patients. All patients had pulse cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone followed by maintenance doses and plasmapheresis. Seven patients had hemodialysis at the beginning, and hemodialysis needed to be continued in three patients. Partial and complete remission was seen in 6 (50%) and 3 (25%) patients, respectively, and pulmonary findings regressed in all patients. End-stage renal disease develops generally in AASV due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis causing severe irreversible glomerular damage. The mortality rate rises to 50% in cases of renal failure with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; therefore, pulse immunosuppressive treatment with plasmapheresis may be life-saving, as shown in our study.

8020511|a|The new non-ionic contrast medium iomeprol (Iomeron) 150/200/250/300/350/400 was tested in a non-selected patient population (n = 4811). The aim of the clinical testing, in a very diverse range of radiographical examinations, was to evaluate its tolerance. A high percentage of the patients showed risk factors such as allergic predisposition (22.0%), cardiovascular diseases (45.3%), and kidney disease (15.1%). In addition, high doses of the contrast medium were used, depending on the radiological problem. The proportion of patients over 70 was 19.5%. Iomeprol proved to be an extremely well tolerated nonionic contrast medium. With the exception of nausea, systemic side effects occurred in less than 1% of cases.

22136782|t|The efficacy of endoscopic triamcinolone injection for the prevention of esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection.
22136782|a|BACKGROUND: Use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for management of widespread superficial esophageal carcinomas may be complicated by the development of severe strictures, which may require serial treatment with endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD). OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of endoscopic triamcinolone injection (ETI) for the prevention of stricture formation after ESD. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 41 consecutive patients who had a semi-circumferential mucosal defect that arose after ESD for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS: EBD and ETI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of stricture and frequency of required EBD. RESULTS: ETI was performed in one group of patients (study group, n = 21) but not in the other (control group, n = 20). The incidence of stricture was significantly lower in the study group (19.0%) than in the control group (75.0%; P < .001). The number of required EBDs was also lower in the study group (mean, 1.7; range, 0-15) than in the control group (mean, 6.6; range 0-20). There were no side effects or complications associated with ETI. LIMITATIONS: Nonrandomized study design and small number of patients in a single endoscopic center. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that ETI is safe and effective for the prevention of esophageal stricture in patients undergoing ESD for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.

17900978|t|Biological and physico-chemical assessment of hydroxyapatite (HA) with different porosity.
17900978|a|HA with specific internal porosities was loaded with different antibiotics (ATBs) and then tested on its microbiological effectiveness. The HA purity was controlled with X-ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectrometry. Varying the sintering temperature and/or adding graphite and PMMA as porogenous agents lead to obtained micro- and meso-porosities. The biological tests concerned cell viability, proliferation and morphology (SEM), and the cytochemical staining of actin and vinculin. The micro- and meso-porous HA samples had an internal pore size of 1-10 microm and 10-50 microm, respectively. X-ray diffraction and FTIR confirmed the high purity of the HA. The cell viability tests with L132 cells confirmed the excellent cytocompatibility of HA, the graphite powder and the ATB vancomycine. Proliferation rate was assessed with MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. All HA samples produced a higher proliferation than the controls; the micro-porous HA inducing the highest cell growth. The ATB impregnated HA also stimulated cell proliferation but in lower extend. Cytochemical staining of osteoblasts revealed a well-developed cytoskeleton with strong stress fibres. Labelling of the focal adhesion contacts with anti-vinculin showed a less developed adhesion process in the cells on the different HA substrates. It was possible to realize a highly pure hydroxyapatite with different but controlled porosities by varying the sintering temperature and/or addition of a porogenous agents. This purity and the micro-porosity stimulate significantly cell growth.

23320385|t|Inhibitory effect of anthocyanidins on hepatic glutathione S-transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and carbonyl reductase activities in rat and human.
23320385|a|1. Anthocyanins and their aglycone anthocyanidins represent the most abundant flavonoids in human diet and popular constituents of various dietary supplements. The aim of this study was to evaluate inhibitory effect of four anthocyanidins (delphinidin, cyanidin, malvidin and pelargonidin) on three families of important drug-metabolizing enzymes: carbonyl reductases (CBRs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). 2. Human or rat hepatic subcellular fractions were incubated with or without pure anthocyanidins (100    µM) and the activities of CBR, GST and UGT were assayed using menadione, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol as substrates, respectively. For the most potent inhibitors, half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined and the inhibition kinetics study was performed. 3. Anthocyanidins inhibited weakly the activity of GST and moderately the activities of CBR and UGT. Cyanidin was the most potent inhibitor of human UGT with IC50   =   69    µM (at 200    µM substrate concentration) and competitive type of action. Delphinidin acted as significant non-competitive inhibitor of human CBR with IC50   =   16    µM (at substrate concentration 500    µM). The inhibitory potency of anthocyanidins differed in rat and human samples significantly. 4. Anthocyanidins are able to inhibit CBR and UGT in vitro. Possible interference of anthocyanidins (in high-dose dietary supplements) with simultaneously administered drugs, which are UGT or CBR substrates, should be checked.

20547054|t|Real-time monitoring of copper ions-induced cytotoxicity by EIS cell chips.
20547054|a|An important goal of biomedical research is the development of tools for high-throughput evaluation of drug effects and cytotoxicity tests. Here we demonstrate EIS cell chips able to monitor cell growth, morphology, adhesion and their changes as a consequence of treatment with drugs or toxic compounds. As a case study, we investigate the uptake of copper ions and its effect on two cell lines: B104 and HeLa cells. For further understanding, we also carried out in parallel with EIS studies, a complete characterization of cell morphology and changes induced by copper ions through complementary methodologies (including state-of-the-art AFM, viability test and Western blot). Our results reveal a strong correlation between EIS data and both MTT test and AFM characterization so our chip can be used as powerful tools in all biology lab in combination with other standard methods giving additional information that can be useful in a complete and deep investigation of a biological process. This chip can be used even alone replacing in vitro drug tests based on conventional biochemical methods, being very cheap and reusable and allowing to perform cytotoxicity tests without using any expensive reagent or equipment.

11366674|a|HIV infection has long been associated with changes in body metabolism, most notably in the form of AIDS wasting and in fat distribution changes. Abnormalities in blood lipid levels are associated with antiviral treatment, and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has caused more cases of high triglycerides and unhealthy cholesterol levels. The frequency and extent of HAART-related metabolic changes is a controversial issue, and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group is drawing on most of its ongoing trials to enroll 3,000 people in a five-year study to track participants experiences with antiretroviral therapy.

24244613|t|Cancer cells resistant to therapy promote cell surface relocalization of GRP78 which complexes with PI3K and enhances PI(3,4,5)P3 production.
24244613|a|Traditionally, GRP78 has been regarded as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal protein due to its carboxyl KDEL retention motif. Recently, a subfraction of GRP78 is found to localize to the surface of specific cell types, serving as co-receptors and regulating signaling. However, the physiological relevance of cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) expression in cancer and its functional interactions at the cell surface are just emerging. In this report, we combined biochemical, imaging and mutational approaches to address these issues. For detection of sGRP78, we utilized a mouse monoclonal antibody highly potent and specific for GRP78 or epitope-tagged GRP78, coupled with imaging and biochemical techniques that allowed detection of sGRP78 but not intracellular GRP78. Our studies revealed that breast and prostate cancer cells resistant to hormonal therapy actively promote GRP78 to the cell surface, which can be further elevated by a variety of ER stress-inducing conditions. We showed that sGRP78 forms complex with PI3K, and overexpression of sGRP78 promotes PIP3 formation, indicative of PI3K activation. We further discovered that an insertion mutant of GRP78 at its N-terminus domain, while retaining stable expression and the ability to translocate to the cell surface as the wild-type protein, exhibited reduced complex formation with p85 and production of PIP3. Thus, our studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling by sGRP78. Our findings suggest that targeting sGRP78 may suppress therapeutic resistance in cancer cells and offer a novel strategy to suppress PI3K activity.

18570872|t|cIAP1 and cIAP2 facilitate cancer cell survival by functioning as E3 ligases that promote RIP1 ubiquitination.
18570872|a|The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins enhances cell survival through mechanisms that remain uncertain. In this report, we show that cIAP1 and cIAP2 promote cancer cell survival by functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases that maintain constitutive ubiquitination of the RIP1 adaptor protein. We demonstrate that AEG40730, a compound modeled on BIR-binding tetrapeptides, binds to cIAP1 and cIAP2, facilitates their autoubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, and causes a dramatic reduction in RIP1 ubiquitination. We show that cIAP1 and cIAP2 directly ubiquitinate RIP1 and induce constitutive RIP1 ubiquitination in cancer cells and demonstrate that constitutively ubiquitinated RIP1 associates with the prosurvival kinase TAK1. When deubiquitinated by AEG40730 treatment, RIP1 binds caspase-8 and induces apoptosis. These findings provide insights into the function of the IAPs and provide new therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of cancer.

18715733|a|In vitro cefditoren antimicrobial activity was tested against 288 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 220 Haemophilus influenzae clinical strains isolated in our hospital from January 2005 to May 2006 by agar dilution and broth microdilution method, respectively. MICs were also determined for 13 and 10 comparison drugs, respectively. The pneumococci tested comprised 113 (39.2%) penicillin susceptible, 91 (31.6%) penicillin intermediate, and 84 (29.2%) penicillin resistant. Cefditoren was the most active drug on the basis of the MICs (MIC(90)=0.5 microg/mL), followed by ceftriaxone and levofloxacin (MIC(90)=1 microg/mL). Cefditoren MICs ranged from 0.25 to 1 microg/mL for ceftriaxone-resistant isolates, with a modal MIC of 0.5 microg/mL and an MIC(90) of 1.0 microg/mL. No S. pneumoniae isolates evaluated in this study showed MICs to cefditoren higher than 1 microg/mL (MIC range, <or=0.015 to 1 microg/mL). Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, the rank order of intrinsic activity (MIC(90), microg/mL) was cefditoren (0.5)<ceftriaxone (2.0)=cefotaxime (2.0)<amoxicillin/clavulanate (8.0)=amoxicillin (8.0)=cefuroxime (8.0). Among the 220 strains of H. influenzae, 42 (19.09%) produced a beta-lactamase (Hi beta+) and 3 (1.1%) were beta-lactamase (Hi beta-) negative but have reduced susceptibility to ampicillin (BLNAR). The most active drugs on the basis of MICs were cefditoren and levofloxacin, showing MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of 0.015/0.06 microg/mL. Cefditoren at concentration of 0.06 microg/mL inhibited all 3 BLNAR (ampicillin MICs >4 microg/mL). Against H. influenzae (Hi beta+), the rank order of intrinsic activity (MIC(90), microg/mL) was cefditoren (0.03) < cefixime (0.06)<ceftriaxone (0.12)=cefotaxime (0.12)<cefuroxime (1.0)<amoxicillin/clavulanate (2.0)<ampicillin (>8.0).

8305497|t|The requirement of p47 phosphorylation for activation of NADPH oxidase by opsonized zymosan in human neutrophils.
8305497|a|Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, staurosporine or 1,5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), inhibited NADPH oxidase activity and phosphorylation of 47 kDa protein (p47) in PMA-stimulated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. These PKC inhibitors, at the same doses, did not affect oxidase activity and caused only partial inhibition of p47 phosphorylation in OZ-stimulated neutrophils. There was residual (20%) phosphorylated p47 in the membranes of OZ-stimulated cells in the presence of PKC inhibitors, at concentrations which caused total inhibition of oxidase activity and p47 phosphorylation in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. In the presence of ionomycin, which increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations, staurosporine was less effective in inhibiting both superoxide generation and p47 phosphorylation stimulated by PMA, similar to its effect in OZ-stimulated cells. The results indicate that some phosphorylation of p47 always accompanied oxidase activation induced by PMA or OZ, though the degree of phosphorylation of membrane-bound p47 does not directly correlate with rates of superoxide production.

16282983|t|Excitotoxicity mediated by Ca2+-permeable GluR4-containing AMPA receptors involves the AP-1 transcription factor.
16282983|a|Cells preferentially expressing GluR4-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are particularly sensitive to excitotoxicity mediated through non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. However, the excitotoxic signalling pathways associated with GluR4-containing AMPA receptors are not known. In this work, we investigated the downstream signals coupled to excitotoxicity mediated by Ca2+-permeable GluR4-containing AMPA receptors, using a HEK 293 cell line constitutively expressing the GluR4flip subunit of AMPA receptors (HEK-GluR4). Glutamate stimulation of GluR4-containing AMPA receptors decreased cell viability, in a calcium-dependent manner, when the receptor desensitisation was prevented with cyclothiazide. The excitotoxic stimulation mediated through GluR4-containing AMPA receptors increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA-binding activity. Inhibition of the AP-1 activity by overexpression of a c-Jun dominant-negative form protected HEK-GluR4 cells against excitotoxic damage. Taken together, the results indicate that overactivation of Ca2+-permeable GluR4-containing AMPA receptors is coupled to a death pathway mediated, at least in part, by the AP-1 transcription factor.

9261632|t|Platelet aggregability and occurrence of restenosis following coronary angioplasty.
9261632|a|Restenosis following percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a complex medical problem occurring in nearly a third of the patients undergoing PTCA with no single definite predictor demonstrated in an individual patient. Platelets are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the restenotic process. However, no known parameter of platelet function or activity has been studied as a risk factor predicting the occurrence of restenosis. We prospectively assessed platelet activation in twenty two consecutive patients with stable angina who underwent a successful PTCA for single vessel coronary artery disease. Platelet activation levels were measured using aggregability curves derived from unclotted blood samples on a platelet aggregometer using varying concentrations of adenosine di-phosphate (ADP) in the following time sequence: (1) Basal i.e. pre-PTCA, (2) post-PTCA day 1, (3) post-PTCA day 7, and (4) post-PTCA day 28. Occurrence of restenosis was studied using angiographic follow-up in all patients. At follow-up, seven of the twenty two patients studied developed restenosis. There was no significant difference or any specific trend noted over time in the levels of platelet aggregability in the study group as a whole (basal: 30.0 +/- 15.4%, post-PTCA day 1: 32.5 +/- 16.1%, post-PTCA day 7: 34.6 +/- 15.4% and post-PTCA day 28: 32.6 +/- 16.1%). However, when the patients were subgrouped into those with and without restenosis, the patients with restenosis had a significantly higher basal platelet aggregability (38.7 +/- 16.3%) versus those who did not develop restenosis (25.0 +/- 12.1%), p = 0.0128. We conclude that patients developing restenosis after PTCA have a significantly higher basal platelet aggregability and this could be used as a marker for its occurrence in an individual patient.

14986283|t|Antiretroviral therapy in patients with hepatitis and HIV: weighing risks and benefits.
14986283|a|Liver disease is an important complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. As HIV-infected patients live longer, they develop long-term manifestations of chronic HIV infection and/or treatment complications. Progressive liver disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Underlying hepatitis B and/or C virus infection is extremely common. All classes of antiretroviral drugs have been associated with some hepatotoxicity, and patients often receive other potentially liver-damaging drugs. Alcohol use is common and frequently underestimated. All of these issues make liver disease an important factor in making antiretroviral decisions. Clinicians should weigh underlying disease, behavioral issues such as drugs and alcohol, and concomitant therapy when choosing antiretrovirals in such patients. We need more research in this area, especially with regard to mechanisms, risks, and management--for specific drugs and regimens--to ensure that our patients receive the benefits of antiretroviral therapy in the safest manner possible.

8270603|t|Inhibitory effects by oral administration of ginsenoside Rh2 on the growth of human ovarian cancer cells in nude mice.
8270603|a|Recently two new compounds, ginsenosides Rh1 and Rh2, have been isolated from an ethanol extract of the processed root of Panax ginseng CA Meyer, and Rh2 (but not Rh1) has been found to cause growth inhibition of cultured B16 melanoma cells. We have also demonstrated that Rh2 caused inhibition of cultured human ovarian cancer cell (HRA) proliferation. The effect of oral administration of Rh2 on tumor growth and survival of nude mice bearing HRA cells was examined. Nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 10(6) HRA cells. After 7 days of tumor inoculation 2 mg/kg cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) was administered intraperitoneally once a week for 5 weeks. In Rh2-treated groups. Rh2 was dissolved in absolute ethanol, adjusted with distilled water to 1, 15, and 120 microM, and 0.4 ml of each concentration was administered orally by canula every day for 90 days, from the next day of tumor inoculation. The tumor volume, hematocrit and body weight were measured every week. On days 56 and 63 after tumor inoculation, the tumor volumes in all groups treated with Rh2 were significantly less than those in an ethanol-treated control group and also in cisplatin treated group. After 70 days, the tumor growth in nude mice treated with 15 microM and 120 microM Rh2 was significantly inhibited compared to that in a cisplatin treated group as well as a control group. Consequently, the survival of nude mice treated with 15 microM and 120 microM Rh2 was also significantly prolonged, compared to that of cisplatin treated mice. No toxic effects were observed in any of the mice.

14602800|t|Characterization of endozepines in the human testicular tissue: effect of triakontatetraneuropeptide on testosterone secretion.
14602800|a|Previous studies have shown that endozepines, i.e. endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, stimulate steroidogenesis in adrenocortical and Leydig cells. In the present report, we have investigated the presence and action of endozepines in the human testis. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed the occurrence of endozepine-like immunoreactivity in Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells. HPLC analysis combined with a specific RIA resolved two immunoreactive peaks that coeluted with synthetic octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) and triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN). RT-PCR amplification showed that the mRNA encoding the endozepine precursor diazepam-binding inhibitor is expressed in the human testis. The action of endozepines on testosterone production was studied in vitro using perifused human testicular fragments. Administration of TTN provoked a dose-dependent increase in testosterone secretion, whereas ODN had no effect. The stimulatory action of TTN on testosterone production was totally blocked by flunitrazepam, a peripheral-type BZD receptor antagonist/central-type BZD receptor (CBR) agonist. Conversely, the CBR agonist clonazepam and the CBR antagonist flumazenil did not affect testosterone secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that, in the human testicular tissue, TTN may exert an intracrine and/or paracrine control of steroidogenesis through activation of a peripheral-type BZD receptor.

20230219|t|Clonogenic assays measure leukemia stem cell killing not detectable by chromium release and flow cytometric cytotoxicity assays.
20230219|a|BACKGROUND AIMS: NK-92, a permanent natural killer (NK) cell line, shows cytotoxicity against a variety of tumors and has been tested in a phase I trial. We tested the toxicity of NK-92 and chemotherapy drugs against the stem cell capacity of the acute leukemia cell line, KG1. While the chromium-release assay is the most common method for assessing cytotoxicity of immune effectors, and flow cytometry is increasingly used, the relationship of either assay to clonogenic readouts remains unknown. METHODS: KG1 was assessed for stem cell frequency by serial dilution, single-cell sorting and colony growth in methylcellulose. KG1 was sorted into CD34(+) CD38(+) and CD34(+) CD38 » populations and recultured in liquid medium or methylcellulose to determine the proliferative capacity of each fraction. Cytotoxicity of NK-92, daunorubicin and cytarabine against KG1 was measured using the chromium-release assay, flow cytometry and clonogenic assays. RESULTS: The culture-initiating cell frequency of whole KG1 was between 1 in 100 to 1000 by serial dilution and single-cell sorting. Although a rare (1-3%) CD34(+) CD38 » population could be demonstrated in KG1, both fractions had equivalent proliferative capacity. The cumulative flow cytotoxicity assay was more sensitive than the chromium-release assay in detecting target cell killing. At a 10:1 ratio NK-92 eliminated the clonogenic capacity of KG1, which was not predicted by the chromium-release assay. CONCLUSIONS: Clonogenic assays provide a more sensitive means of assessing the effect of a cytotoxic agent against putative cancer stem cells within cell lines, provided that they grow well in liquid culture medium or methylcellulose.

19854261|t|Effects of dinuclear copper(II) complexes with 6-(benzylamino)purine derivatives on AhR and PXR dependent expression of cytochromes P450 CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 genes in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
19854261|a|A series of dinuclear copper(II) complexes of the compositions [Cu(2)(micro-L(n))(2)(micro-Cl)(2)Cl(2)] (1, 2), [Cu(2)(micro-L(n))(4)Cl(2)]Cl(2).2H(2)O (3, 4) and [Cu(2)(micro-L(n))(4)(ClO(4))(2)](ClO(4))(2).xSolv (5, 6; xSolv=4MeOH for 5 and 2EtOH for 6), involving 6-(benzylamino)purine derivatives (L(n)), have been evaluated with the aim to determine their possible drug interactions and their capability to induce the expression of major drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450. The above-mentioned complexes have been chosen based on the fact that substantial both in vitro (cytotoxicity, SOD-mimic) and in vivo (antidiabetic) biological activity has been found for them. As models, primary cultures of human hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells HepG2 transiently transfected with a plasmid containing dioxin-responsive element fused to the luciferase reporter gene (DRE-LUC) have been chosen. It has been found that the tested complexes 1-6 did not significantly induce the expression of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 mRNAs in the concentration range of 0.1-10.0microM, in three different primary human hepatocyte cultures after 24h of the treatment. On the other hand, the model inducers, i.e. 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and rifampicin, significantly increased the levels of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 mRNAs in all cultures. In addition, compounds 1-6 did not transactivate DRE-LUC in transiently transfected HepG2, while TCDD strongly induced luciferase activity after 24h of incubation. Based on the obtained results, it may be concluded that the studied dinuclear copper(II) complexes 1-6 possess very low toxicological potential to cause drug interactions in terms of transcriptional activation of the major human cytochromes P450.

16140711|t|Folate status of mothers during pregnancy and mental and psychomotor development of their children at five years of age.
16140711|a|OBJECTIVE: There are limited data relating folate nutritional status of mothers during pregnancy to mental and psychomotor development of their offspring. Using an existing data set from a study on the effect of prenatal zinc supplementation on child neurodevelopment, we evaluated the association between folate nutritional status of mothers during pregnancy and neurodevelopment of their children. METHODS: Maternal blood folate and total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations were measured at 19, 26, and 37 weeks of gestation. At a mean of 5.3 years of age, 355 black children with low-socioeconomic background were given 6 tests: Differential Ability Scales, Visual and Auditory Sequential Memory, Knox Cube Test, Gross Motor Scale, and Grooved Pegboard. The scores of the tests between the 2 groups of mothers with poor versus adequate folate nutritional status classified by blood folate or tHcy concentrations were compared. RESULTS: There were no differences in the test scores of neurodevelopment between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Folate nutritional status of mothers in the later half of pregnancy assessed by plasma and erythrocyte folate and plasma tHcy concentrations had no impact on neurodevelopment of their children at age 5. It is unknown whether our findings in a low-socioeconomic population can be readily extrapolated to other populations.

19857103|t|Evaluation of biomarkers of inflammation in response to benzalkonium chloride on corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.
19857103|a|PURPOSE: Most eye drops contain preservatives; benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is most common. Recent data demonstrated BAK adding to toxicity. BAK is degraded into hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which in even small amounts is known to be an irritant. Increased toxicity should cause localized inflammation with increased elaboration of inflammatory biomarkers. To evaluate the inflammation BAK causes to the ocular surface, enzyme linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) were utilized to quantify the levels of inflammatory biomarkers in response to BAK and/or H(2)O(2). METHODS: Immortalized human conjunctival and corneal epithelial cells were exposed to: BAK (0.001%-0.1%), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) (0.01%-0.1%), and cell media for 1 h. Cytokine quantification was performed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISAs]). Additional experimentation was performed in which testing solutions were replaced with media after 1 h and the resulting supernatants quantified after 24 h. RESULTS: BAK induced significant amounts of interleukin (IL-) 1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), but only moderate amounts of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL- 10 and 12, and H(2)O(2). Lower concentrations of BAK induced proportionally less elaboration. Replacing the test solutions with media and providing 23 h for cytokine elaboration significantly increased TNF, but not IL-1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) positive controls induced substantial elaboration/release of both IL-1 and TNF as did in increasing the exposure to the full 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: After 1 h of exposure, BAK increased quantities of all biomarkers. The biomarkers in decreasing order of induction/upregulation were: TNF > or = IL-1 > or = IL-12 > or = IL-10 > or = CRP. Even low concentrations caused some degree of inflammation. Replacing the testing solution with media and providing 23 h for cytokine elaboration, significantly increased the elaboration/release of TNF, but not IL-1, as compared to the 1-h BAK exposure. Whereas increasing the exposure to the full 24 h by not removing the testing solution at the 1-h time point significantly increased the elaboration/release of both IL-1 and TNF.

12001973|t|Increased vitamin A intake in children aged 2-5 years through targeted home-gardens in a rural South African community.
12001973|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine vitamin A intake of children aged 2-5 years in a rural South African community one year after the implementation of a home-based food production programme targeting beta-carotene-rich fruits and vegetables. DESIGN: Dietary intake of children aged 2-5 years was determined during a cross-sectional survey before and one year after the implementation of a home-based food production programme. SETTING: A low socio-economic rural African community, approximately 60 km northwest of the coastal city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. SUBJECTS: Children aged 2-5 years (n = 100); 50 children from households with home-gardens producing beta-carotene fruits and vegetables (project gardens), and 50 children from households without project gardens. RESULTS: As compared with baseline data, there was a significant increase in vitamin A intake in children from households with project gardens as well as in children from households without project gardens. However, children from households with project gardens had a significantly higher vitamin A intake than children from households without project gardens. The increased vitamin A intake in those children from households without project gardens can be attributed to the availability of butternuts in the local shop (as a result of the project), and because the mothers negotiated with project garden mothers to obtain these fruits and vegetables for their children. CONCLUSION: A home-based food production programme targeting beta-carotene-rich fruits and vegetables can lead to an increase in vitamin A intake.

23625769|t|A 7-year case of furosemide-induced immune thrombocytopenia.
23625769|a|Immune thrombocytopenia has been attributed to many causes. Several drugs have been implicated as culprits in causing drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Although the mechanism for this type of thrombocytopenia is not well understood, at least three types of antibodies appear to be involved: drug-dependent antibodies, hapten-dependent antibodies, and drug-induced platelet-reactive autoantibodies. In this report, we describe a case in which furosemide was identified as the probable cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia in an 84-year-old man with chronic symptomatic idiopathic thrombocytopenia for seven years before discovery. The patient's platelet count and daily furosemide dose, both intravenous and oral, were documented throughout his medical history. A dose-dependent change in platelet count was observed in association with the furosemide dose. His platelet count increased on discontinuation of furosemide and beginning of torsemide. Several months after discontinuation of furosemide, his platelet count increased to a 9-year high of 206 × 10 ³/mm ³ from a low of 36 × 10 ³/mm ³ while receiving furosemide therapy. Based on the observations of this case report, clinicians should more readily consider furosemide as a potential cause of thrombocytopenia.

2279717|t|Urinary catecholamines in hyperthermia-related deaths.
2279717|a|A group of five hyperthermia-related deaths is presented in which urinary noradrenaline (NA) concentrations were elevated (172.1 +/- 119.4 ng/ml) compared with a control group of rapid violent deaths (43.7 +/- 26.1 ng/ml). Urinary adrenaline (A) concentrations were not elevated in the hyperthermia cases, nor were there any significant differences in urinary dopamine (DA) concentrations between the two groups. All except one of the hyperthermia victims were under the influence of ethanol. It is suggested that a combination of heat stress and ethanol consumption was responsible for the elevated urinary NA in the hyperthermia cases, reflecting increased sympathetic nervous system activity. A combination of high urinary NA with low A seems to be characteristic of hyperthermia fatalities, in contrast to hypothermia deaths, where both NA and A are usually elevated.

16720756|t|Evaluation of original dual thromboxane A2 modulators as antiangiogenic agents.
16720756|a|Angiogenesis is a promising target for the therapy of several diseases including cancer. This study was undertaken to characterize the antiangiogenic properties of a series of original dual thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) inhibitors derived from torasemide, a marketed loop diuretic with TXA(2) antagonistic properties, by evaluating their effects on human endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and viability in vitro, as well as in the ex vivo rat aortic ring assay. All drugs tested exhibited a marked affinity toward human platelet TXA(2) receptor, significantly prevented platelet aggregation induced by U-46,619, a stable TXA(2) receptor agonist, and inhibited platelet TXA(2) synthase without affecting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 or COX-2 enzymatic activities. These dual TXA(2) inhibitors dose dependently inhibited endothelial cell migration in chemotaxis assays using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a chemoattractant but failed to affect cell adhesion and viability. The highest rates of cell migration inhibition were obtained with original compounds BM-567 and BM-573 (50.3 and 59.4% inhibition, respectively) when used at the final concentration of 10 microM. In addition, pretreatment of endothelial cells with these two drugs significantly prevented U-46,619-induced intracellular Ca(2+) pool mobilization, thus suggesting a mechanistic link between inhibition of the TXA(2) pathway and reduced endothelial cell migration. Treatment of rat aortic explants with U-46,619 (9,11-dideoxy-9,11-methanoepoxy-prostaglandin F(2)) significantly enhanced vessel sprouting whereas aortic rings treated with some of the compounds, including BM-567 (N-n-pentyl-N'-[2-(cyclohexylamino)-5-nitrobenzenesulfonyl]urea) and BM-573 (N-tert-butyl-N'-[5-nitro-2-p-toluylaminobenzenesulfonyl]urea), showed a significant decrease in vessel sprouting, which was not reversed by the addition of VEGF. These data suggest that our original dual TXA(2) inhibitors bear antiangiogenic properties, mainly by inhibiting endothelial cell migration.

18166847|t|Thymic carcinoid responds to neoadjuvant therapy with sunitinib and octreotide: a case report.
18166847|a|Carcinoids are malignant neuroendocrine tumors consisting of a spectrum of neoplasms from low-grade typical carcinoid to high-grade small cell carcinoma. We report a case of atypical thymic carcinoid that responded to neoadjuvant therapy with octreotide and sunitinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor. After 3 weeks of treatment, tumor size significantly decreased to allow for a safe surgical resection with clear margins. We believe that further study of sunitinib and octreotide with the neoadjuvant intent of preparing tumors for resection is warranted as a strategy to improve curative management of neuroendocrine tumors.

23464876|t|Color and spatial frequency are related to visual pattern sensitivity in migraine.
23464876|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for particular colors to alleviate visual discomfort when people with migraine view repetitive geometric or striped patterns. BACKGROUND: Visual stimuli, such as flicker, glare, or stripes, can trigger migraine and headache. They can also elicit feelings of discomfort and aversion. There are reports that color can be used to decrease the experience of discomfort and reduce migraine frequency. DESIGN/METHODS: Five sets of striped patterns (3, 12 cycles per degree [cpd]) were created using cardinal colors tailored to selectively stimulate the early visual pathways: achromatic (black/white), tritan (black/purple, black/yellow), protan/deutan (black/red, black/green). All had the same high luminance contrast (0.9 Michelson contrast). Twenty-eight migraine (14 migraine with aura, 14 migraine without aura) and 14 control participants rated the discomfort and described the distortions seen in these patterns. They were also assessed for visual migraine/headache triggers, contrast sensitivity, color vision, acuity, stereopsis, visual discomfort from reading, and dyslexia. RESULTS: In the migraine groups, a comparable number of illusions were seen with the 3 and 12 cpd achromatic gratings, whereas in the control group the greatest number was seen with the 3 cpd grating. In the migraine groups only, all 4 colors reduced, to some extent, the number of illusions and 2 decreased the discomfort, particularly for the 12 cpd gratings. There were significant group differences for contrast sensitivity, reported visual migraine/headache triggers, and the visual discomfort scale. There were a few significant correlations between the different measures, notably between the achromatic visual discomfort measures and reports of visual migraine triggers. CONCLUSIONS: Color, independent of luminance or particular color contrasts, can have therapeutic effects for people with visually triggered migraine as it can reduce the number of perceived illusions when viewing stripes or text. The effect was not color-specific and was greatest for the 12 cpd gratings. Given the significant associations between the achromatic discomfort measures and reports of visual triggers, and the lack of significant associations between the chromatic discomfort measures and reports of visual triggers, further research is recommended to explore the potential to reduce the number of visually triggered migraines with color in addition to alleviating visual discomfort.

7646926|t|Determination of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine by automated coupled-column high performance liquid chromatography: a powerful technique for assaying in vivo oxidative DNA damage in cancer patients.
7646926|a|An automated analytical method has been developed for determination of the oxidative DNA adduct, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) in human urine, based on coupled-column high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Urine is concentrated on Bondelut CH by means of an automated sample processor, and the enriched sample injected on to a polymeric reversed phase column coupled in line with an electrochemical detector and a C18 reversed phase column. By use of the electrochemical detector, a suitable retention time interval is set for collection of the fraction containing 8OHdG from the chromatography on the first column; this fraction is collected in a 2 mL loop and injected onto the C18 column. The system is operated by an automatic valve station controlled by an integrator. The method has a large sample capacity and measures 31.1, 15.7, and 7.43 nmol 8OHdG/L urine with variation coefficients of 8, 8 and 24% within series and 8, 11 and 23% between series. Normal healthy individuals were found to excrete 14.9 +/- 7.8 nmol 8OHdG/24 h, or 1.11 +/- 0.62 mumol 8OHdG per mol creatinine, in their urine, whereas increased levels of 8OHdG were found in 24 h collections from a variety of cancer patients, both in samples taken before onset of oncological therapy (1.84 +/- 1.12 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.01 versus healthy individuals) and after therapy onset (2.18 +/- 1.44 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals). Moreover, mean values of 8OHdG in random urinary samples from cancer patients were significantly higher than from healthy individuals (2.42 +/- 2.28 versus 1.19 +/- 0.48 mumol/mol creatinine, P < 0.001), both in samples taken before therapy onset (1.91 +/- 0.96, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals) and after (2.57 +/- 2.46, P < 0.001 versus healthy individuals). High levels of urinary 8OHdG were found in patients subjected to whole body irradiation, and in patients receiving chemotherapy with various cytostatic agents. The potential use of the method for detecting increased urinary 8OHdG excretion and conditions associated with increased oxidative DNA damage in humans is discussed.

22296885|t|Effect of Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on markers of platelet and endothelial function in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
22296885|a|OBJECTIVE: Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce platelet and endothelial activation in patients with or at risk of cardiac disease. We aimed to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in addition to best medical therapy can reduce the increased platelet and endothelial activity that is present in patients with intermittent claudication. METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients who were receiving aspirin and statin therapy were recruited into a randomised cross-over double blind study involving 6 week supplementation with OMACOR fish oil (850-882 mg eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid) versus placebo. A 12 week washout period occurred between treatments. Patients with diabetes were excluded. For each outcome a random effects model was fitted in which treatment and period were fixed effects and patients were random effects. RESULTS: Omega-3 supplementation had no effect on the primary outcome measure von Willebrand factor. Similarly Omega-3 supplementation resulted in no change in unstimulated or stimulated P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding, or platelet aggregation (Ultegra point of care). Pulse wave velocity was also unchanged. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, s-ICAM and IL-6 were also unchanged. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with Omega-3 fatty acids had no affect on platelet and endothelial activation or markers of inflammation in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

8197200|t|Cloning, expression, and localization of a chloride-facilitated, cocaine-sensitive serotonin transporter from Drosophila melanogaster.
8197200|a|We report here on the isolation and characterization of a serotonin (5HT) transporter from Drosophila melanogaster. A 3.1-kb complementary DNA clone (dSERT) was found to encode a protein of 622 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 69 kDa and a putative transmembrane topology characteristic of cloned members of the mammalian Na+/Cl- neurotransmitter cotransporter gene family. dSERT displays highest overall amino acid sequence identity with the mammalian 5HT (51%), norepinephrine (47%), and dopamine (47%) transporters and shares with all transporters 104 absolutely conserved amino acid residues. Upon transient expression in HeLa cells, dSERT exhibited saturable, high-affinity, and sodium-dependent [3H]5HT uptake with estimated Km and Vmax values of approximately 500 nM and 5.2 x 10(-18) mol per cell per min, respectively. In marked contrast to the human SERT (hSERT), 5HT-mediated transport by dSERT was not absolutely dependent on extracellular Cl-, while the sodium-dependent uptake of 5HT was facilitated by increased extracellular Cl- concentrations. dSERT displays a pharmacological profile and rank order of potency consistent with, but not identical to, mammalian 5HT transporters. Comparison of the affinities of various compounds for the inhibition of 5HT transport by both dSERT and hSERT revealed that antidepressants were 3- to 300-fold less potent on dSERT than on hSERT, while mazindol displayed approximately 30-fold greater potency for dSERT. Both cocaine and RTI-55 inhibited 5HT uptake by dSERT with estimated inhibition constants of approximately 500 nM, while high concentrations (> 10 microM) of dopamine, norepinephrine, octopamine, tyramine, and histamine failed to inhibit transport. In situ hybridization reveals the selective expression of dSERT mRNA to specific cell bodies in the ventral ganglion of the embryonic and larval Drosophila nervous system with a distribution pattern virtually identical to that of 5HT-containing neurons. The dSERT gene was mapped to position 60C on chromosome 2. The availability of the gene encoding the unique ion dependence and pharmacological characteristics of dSERT may allow for identification of those amino acid residues and structural motifs that confer the pharmacologic specificity and genetic regulation of the 5HT transport process.

23635729|t|Prophylactic use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system in women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen: a randomized controlled trial.
23635729|a|OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rate of endometrial pathology with the prophylactic use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system in women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. METHODS: This was a randomized contro-lled trial of 129 Chinese women who attended a university hospital in Hong Kong and required adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer after the completion of postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Women were randomized to treatment (prophylactic levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system insertion before the commencement of tamoxifen) or control group. The uterine cavity was examined by hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling before the commencement of tamoxifen and at 12, 24, 45, and 60 months afterward. Any endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids were resected through hysteroscopy at each assessment and specimens were sent for histologic confirmation. RESULTS: A total of 94 women completed 5-year follow-up. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of submucosal fibroids (1 [1.8%] compared with 2 [3.4%]) and endometrial hyperplasia (both 0) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system significantly reduced de novo endometrial polyps (hazard ratio 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.48) over the course of 5 years on an intention-to-treat basis. There was no statistically significant increase in breast cancer recurrence rate (10 [17.2%] compared with 6 [10.0%]) or cancer-related deaths (6 [10.3%] compared with 5 [8.3%]) in the treatment group, but the study was underpowered in this regard. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system prevents de novo endometrial polyps in women using tamoxifen. However, its role in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma as well as its effect on risk of breast cancer recurrence remain uncertain.

10773723|t|Structure and composition of common bile duct stones in relation to duodenal diverticula, gastric resection, cholecystectomy and infection.
10773723|a|BACKGROUND: Common bile duct stones represent a clinical problem often involving severe infection, cholangitis and cholestasis. Stasis and infection are thought to play a part in the pathogenesis of choledocholithiasis. Investigations on the etiology of common bile duct stones are, however, scarce because of the difficult access to common bile duct stones and bile. In a clinical series of common bile duct stones, we studied the gross appearance of stones extracted endoscopically from the common bile duct and measured the cholesterol and bilirubinate content in order to elucidate factors of importance to etiology. METHODS: In 135 patients treated endoscopically for bile duct stones, the stones or parts of the stones were collected. Appearances of the cut surface of the stones were studied and described. Cholesterol and bilirubinate content were analyzed enzymatically and with infrared spectroscopy. The growth in bile of gas-producing bacteria previously shown to be correlated with enterobacteriacea was investigated. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the stones were pigment stones, the majority with concentric pigmented layering. There was good agreement between cholesterol measurements. With a cutoff at 50% for the infrared measurements and 25% for the enzymatic assay only 3 stones were discordant between cholesterol measurements and visual inspection. Twenty-one of 23 patients with a previous Billroth-II gastric resection had pigment stones (p < 0.05). Gas-producing bacteria were significantly more prevalent in the bile from patients with layered pigment stones. CONCLUSION: Pigment stones with concentric layering highly suggestive of a cyclic process of crystallization were recovered from the common bile duct in 70% of the patients in our series.

11493513|t|Another feature of TURP syndrome: hyperglycaemia and lactic acidosis caused by massive absorption of sorbitol.
11493513|a|Endoscopic transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be complicated by absorption of a large volume of irrigation fluid. The clinical features of this complication are referred as the TURP syndrome. We report a case where hyperglycaemia and lactic acidosis complicated the TURP syndrome caused by the massive absorption (approximately 15 litres) of a sorbitol- mannitol irrigation solution. The proposed mechanism is a type B lactic acidosis related to the metabolism of sorbitol.

8697554|t|Intrathecal ketamine reduces morphine requirements in patients with terminal cancer pain.
8697554|a|PURPOSE: Ketamine has been administered epidurally and intrathecally for operative and post-operative pain control. Animal studies showed potentiation of analgesia induced by ketamine and morphine. We hypothesized that intrathecal ketamine would potentiate the effects of intrathecal morphine in the treatment of cancer pain. METHODS: A double blind, cross over study was designed to evaluate the effect of ketamine on spinal morphine analgesia in terminal cancer pain patients. A two-phase protocol was used; phase M, intrathecal morphine alone twice daily; phase M + K, co-administration of ketamine (1.0 mg) with morphine intrathecally twice daily. The dose of morphine was titrated upwards until acceptable pain relief was achieved, defined by numeric rating scales (0-10) < or = 3, and the rescue dose of morphine was less than 5 mg after each intrathecal administration for two days. The dose of intrathecal morphine was defined as the effective dose. RESULTS: The effective dose of intrathecal morphine in phase M of 0.38 +/- 0.04 mg.day-1 was higher than that in phase M + K (0.17 +/- 0.02 mg.day-1) (P < 0.05). The average pain scales were 7.95 +/- 0.25 before intrathecal drug administration. Pain scales were decreased to 2.2 +/- 0.17 (P < 0.05) in phase M and 1.95 +/- 0.20 (P < 0.05) in phase M + K after the effective dose of morphine had been reached. No serious side effects were observed in this study. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that ketamine enhances the analgesic effect of morphine, thus reducing the dose of intrathecal morphine.

9057785|t|Adverse drug reactions from birth to early childhood.
9057785|a|Neonates and older infants are a diverse group of children, quite different from their older counterparts. Adverse drug reactions may have profound immediate, delayed, and long-term implications for their neurologic and somatic development. The intrauterine, neonatal, and infancy periods are the only stages in life in which one is exposed to and affected by drugs administered to another person, the mother. In addition, because of the fragility of the neonate and the complexity of their illnesses, their pharmacotherapy is frequently complicated with misadventure and adverse drug reactions that are unavoidable or difficult to assess. Because of their differences in morphology and disease process and treatments, infants and children experience a different range of adverse drug reactions. These reactions are not necessarily predictable from the adult experience. Despite the advances made in the field of pediatric adverse drug reactions and the lessons learned through the misfortunes involving children, children continue to suffer. Sixty years after the Elixir of Sulfanilamide-Massengill disaster, children continue to be given medications with diethylene glycol in developing countries. Pediatricians, pharmacologists, and others must continue to be vigilant and active in preventing, monitoring, and treating adverse drug reactions in children. Learning from mistakes of the past will improve the health of children by preventing mistakes in the future.

15068490|t|Xanthurenic acid translocates proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins into mitochondria and impairs mitochondrial function.
15068490|a|BACKGROUND: Xanthurenic acid is an endogenous molecule produced by tryptophan degradation, produced in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Its accumulation can be observed in aging-related diseases, e.g. senile cataract and infectious disease. We previously reported that xanthurenic acid provokes apoptosis, and now present a study of the response of mitochondria to xanthurenic acid. RESULTS: Xanthurenic acid at 10 or 20 microM in culture media of human aortic smooth muscle cells induces translocation of the proteins Bax, Bak, Bclxs, and Bad into mitochondria. In 20 microM xanthurenic acid, Bax is also translocated to the nucleus. In isolated mitochondria xanthurenic acid leads to Bax and Bclxs oligomerization, accumulation of Ca2+, and increased oxygen consumption. CONCLUSION: Xanthurenic acid interacts directly with Bcl-2 family proteins, inducing mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis and impairing mitochondrial functions.

10197087|t|Carcinoid tumours presenting as breast cancer: the utility of radionuclide imaging with 123I-MIBG and 111In-DTPA pentetreotide.
10197087|a|Secondary tumours of any type in the breast are rare. A review of the literature demonstrated only 23 cases of carcinoid tumours with associated breast metastasis, as distinct from primary carcinoid tumours of the breast. Distant metastases from carcinoid tumours are correlated with poor prognosis and survival. Although both primary and metastatic mammary carcinoid tumours are uncommon, the recognition of the true origin of the tumours may be of importance owing to the different clinical management and prognosis of the two conditions. Recently, radionuclide-labelled imaging techniques have been applied to the localization of such lesions, based on isotope uptake by receptors present in these neuroendocrine tumours. We report two new cases of carcinoid tumours with breast metastases, the primaries being in the ileocaecal valve and the bronchus, respectively. The diagnosis of a carcinoid tumour was based on the clinical, biochemical, histopathological and immunostaining features. Furthermore, these patients had both 123I-MIBG and 111In pentetreotide scintigraphy performed. These radionuclides play a useful role in the localization and potentially in the management of carcinoid tumours and their distant metastases.

21696081|t|A comparison of spinal isobaric levobupivacaine and racemic bupivacaine for lower abdominal and lower extremity surgery.
21696081|a|BACKGROUND: Levobupivacaine is a new long-acting local anesthetic, which is the isolated S-enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine with less cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity than bupivacaine. Reports using levobupivacaine for epidural or brachial plexus anesthesia suggested equivalent clinical efficacy to bupivacaine. However, inadequate information for spinal anesthesia was found OBJECTIVE: To study the onset of motor block and other anesthetic efficacy of intrathecally administered racemic bupivacaine compared with levobupivacaine. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective randomized double blind study at Srinagarind Hospital included seventy patients aged 18-65 years, ASA I-II, scheduled for elective lower abdominal and lower extremity surgery under spinal anesthesia was done. Exclusion criteria were known hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, contraindication against spinal anesthesia, morbid obesity, or patient unable to understand the study protocol. The patients were divided into two groups. They received either 0.5% isobaric racemic bupivacaine 3 mL or 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine 3 mL for spinal anesthesia. The measurement included vital signs, peak block height, motor and sensory blockade and side effects. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the quality of motor and sensory block (p-value > 0.05). The median of peak block height of racemic bupivacaine and levobupivacaine group was T9 (T6-T12) and T9 (T4-T12) respectively Afew adverse events were detected and treated carefully with no clinically significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that 15 mg of isobaric racemic bupivacaine and levobupivacaine for spinal anesthesia had equivalent peak block height and showed equally effective efficacy regarding to both the onset time and duration of motor and sensory blockade.

11261883|t|Doxorubicin-peptide conjugates overcome multidrug resistance.
11261883|a|A well-known mechanism leading to the emergence of multidrug-resistant tumor cells is the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is capable of lowering intracellular drug concentrations. To overcome this problem, we tested the capability of two peptide vectors that are able to cross cellular membranes to deliver doxorubicin in P-gp-expressing cells. The antitumor effect of peptide-conjugated doxorubicin was tested in human erythroleukemic (K562/ ADR) resistant cells. The conjugate showed potent dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth against K562/ADR cells as compared with doxorubicin alone. Doxorubicin exhibited IC50 concentrations of 65 microM in the resistant cells, whereas vectorized doxorubicin was more effective with IC50 concentrations of 3 microM. After treatment of the resistant cells with verapamil, the intracellular levels of doxorubicin were markedly increased and consequent cytotoxicity was improved. In contrast, treatment of resistant cells with verapamil did not cause any further enhancement in the cell uptake nor in the cytotoxic effect of the conjugated doxorubicin, indicating that the conjugate bypasses the P-gp. Finally, we show by the in situ brain perfusion method in P-gp-deficient and competent mice that vectorized doxorubicin bypasses the P-gp present at the luminal site of the blood-brain barrier. These results indicate that vectorization of doxorubicin with peptide vectors is effective in overcoming multidrug resistance.

18266236|t|Increased dosing requirements for 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine in inflammatory bowel disease patients six years and younger.
18266236|a|BACKGROUND: 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are effective for the induction and maintenance of remission and reduction of corticosteroid exposure for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The standard dose of 6-MP is 1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day and for AZA is 2.0-2.5 mg/kg/day. The aim of this study was to determine whether IBD patients 6 years of age and younger require higher than standard doses of 6-MP/AZA to achieve clinical remission. METHODS: Clinical data was collected retrospectively for all IBD patients 6 years of age or younger treated with 6-MP/AZA at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. RESULTS: Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria. IBD was diagnosed at a median age of 3.3 years (25-75th %ile 2.3-4.6 years) and 6-MP/AZA was initiated at a median age of 3.9 years (range 0.8-6.8 years). After dose escalation, the median AZA-equivalent dose was 3.1 mg/kg/day (25-75th %ile 2.5-3.5, max. dose 5.1 mg/kg/day). At the final recorded dose, 8/13 (62%) patients receiving AZA >3.0 mg/kg/day achieved clinical remission, compared to 2/12 (17%) receiving 2-3 mg/kg/day (P = 0.02). The risk of having active disease was on average 85% lower if the AZA-equivalent dose was >3.0 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval [CI] 72%-93%). Adverse events were experienced by 4/30 patients (hepatitis, n = 2; leukopenia, n = 2). No patients had to discontinue 6-MP/AZA, and all laboratory abnormalities improved spontaneously or with dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The standard dose of 6-MP/AZA may not be adequate for IBD patients 6 years of age and younger. Closely monitored dose escalation beyond the standard dosing range is effective and well-tolerated.

19106615|t|Proteomic identification of carboxypeptidase E connects lipid-induced beta-cell apoptosis and dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
19106615|a|Type 2 diabetes occurs when the endocrine pancreas can no longer secrete enough insulin to maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis. This is likely due to cumulative defects in beta-cell fate and function, as well as insulin resistance. A number of recent studies, including ones from our group, have used unbiased proteomic, genomic and genetic approaches to unravel the mechanisms by which hyperlipidemia causes beta-cell apoptosis and dysfunction. It is clear from these studies and others, that there are multiple pathways by which fatty acids such as palmitate can lead to beta-cell dysfunction and death. In the present article, we highlight the role for dysfunction in the ER and secretory pathway in the toxic effects of free fatty acids. Recent work has shown that the rapid degradation of carboxypeptidase E plays a significant role in beta-cell death in response to the free fatty acid palmitate.

23220021|t|In-silico drug screening and potential target identification for hepatocellular carcinoma using Support Vector Machines based on drug screening result.
23220021|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe liver malignancy with few drug treatment options. In finding an effective treatment for HCC, screening drugs that are already FDA-approved will fast track the clinical trial and drug approval process. Connectivity Map (CMap), a large repository of chemical-induced gene expression profiles, provides the opportunity to analyze drug properties on the basis of gene expression. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were utilized to classify the effectiveness of drugs against HCC using gene expression profiles in CMap. The results of this classification will help us (1) identify genes that are chemically sensitive, and (2) predict the effectiveness of remaining chemicals in CMap in the treatment of HCC and provide a prioritized list of possible HCC drugs for biological verification. Four HCC cell lines were treated with 146 distinct chemicals, and cell viability was examined. SVM successfully classified the effectiveness of the chemicals with an average Area Under ROC Curve (AUROC) of 0.9. Using reported HCC patient samples, we identified chemically sensitive genes that may be possible HCC therapeutic targets, including MT1E, MYC, and GADD45B. Using SVM, several known HCC inhibitors, such as geldanamycin, alvespimycin (HSP90 inhibitors), and doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug), were predicted. Seven out of the 23 predicted drugs were cardiac glycosides, suggesting a link between this drug category and HCC inhibition. The study demonstrates a strategy of in silico drug screening with SVM using a large repository of microarrays based on initial in vitro drug screening. Verifying these results biologically would help develop a more accurate chemical sensitivity model.

16874687|t|Fluvastatin prevents oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced injury of renal tubular epithelial cells by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-signaling pathway.
16874687|a|BACKGROUND: Lipid abnormalities may play a role in the progression of nephrosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) appears to be a detrimental factor for the glomerular mesangium and podocytes. The aim of the present study is to identify the potential effects of oxLDL on tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in vitro and to investigate its associated signal transduction pathway, as well as to examine whether fluvastatin reverses the responses of TECs to oxLDL. METHODS: Hypertrophy of cells was evaluated by measurements of [ 3 H]-leucine incorporation, the total protein contents of cells and cell cycle determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) flow cytometry. TGF-beta beta 1 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An Akt kinase assay kit was used to determine Akt activity. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western blot. Wortmannin, the specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), was used to reflect the possible involvement of PI3K. RESULTS: The results show that exposure to oxLDL increased Akt activity and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulating with oxLDL increases the incorporation of [ 3 H]-leucine by 1.3 fold and causes a 1.6-fold increase in total protein content. Compared with that for the control group, the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase is 19% higher in the oxLDL group. And the secretion of TGF-beta beta 1 is increased when incubated with oxLDL. Wortmannin treatment significantly inhibits the effects induced by oxLDL, indicating that the effect of oxLDL is PI3K dependent. Fluvastatin significantly decreases Akt phosphorylation and activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incorporation of [ 3 H]-leucine, total protein content, cell cycle distribution and TGF-beta beta 1 expression are all attenuated by fluvastatin, and these effects are prevented with mevalonate. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt-signaling transduction system is activated by oxLDL, and may mediate the cell hypertrophy and up-regulation of TGF-beta beta 1 expression from TECs. Fluvastatin may inhibit the activity of PI3K/Akt and prevent injury to TECs from oxLDL.

17365758|t|Anticipating clinical integration of genetically tailored tobacco dependence treatment: perspectives of primary care physicians.
17365758|a|Emerging research will likely make it possible to tailor pharmacological treatment for individuals with tobacco dependence by genotype. This study explored primary care physicians' attitudes about the strengths of and barriers to using genetic testing to match patients to optimal nicotine replacement therapy. Four focus groups (n=27) were conducted, and data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Physicians reported how likely they would be to offer patients a genetic test to tailor smoking treatment in response to three different scenarios that described characteristics of the genetic test based on published research. Respondents were on average 36 years of age; 59% were male and 67% were white. Physicians believed genetically tailored treatment may offer new hope to smokers trying to quit, yet they also noted several potential barriers to clinical integration. Barriers included erroneous assumptions by patients regarding the meaning of genetic test results, possible misinterpretation of information regarding racial differences in the prevalence of certain risk alleles, and potential discrimination against patients undergoing testing. Concerns increased dramatically when physicians were told that the same genotypes that would be identified to tailor smoking treatment also have been associated with increased risk of becoming addicted to nicotine, as well as other addictions and psychiatric disorders. Physicians were interested in the possibility of realizing improved smoking cessation outcomes through pharmacogenetic developments, but they also raised many concerns. Primary care physicians will need additional educational inputs and system support prior to integrating genetic testing for a common trait into their routine clinical practice.

17462553|t|Effect of a sardine supplement on C-reactive protein in patients receiving hemodialysis.
17462553|a|OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the effect of a canned sardine supplement in C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients on hemodialysis (HD) and the compliance and adherence to this supplement. DESIGN: This was a quasi-experimental study: Participants with a serum CRP of 5 mg/dL or less volunteered to consume a sardine supplement or were maintained on the usual cheese/ham sandwich supplement. SETTING: The study took place in two outpatient dialysis units in Lisbon, Portugal. PATIENTS: The study comprised 63 patients receiving maintenance HD three times per week for at least 6 months and an initial CRP concentration of 5 mg/dL or less. Exclusion criteria included the presence of graft vascular access or history of cancer. INTERVENTION: After a 4-week washout period, the nutritional intervention included a canned sardine sandwich for the case group (n = 31) and a cheese or ham sandwich for the control group (n = 32), to be ingested during each routine HD session, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were the outcome measure. RESULTS: Only 65 patients from the invited 186 patients met the inclusion criteria and agreed to eat the sardine sandwich supplement three times per week and were involved in the study. A significant proportion of 48% (n = 31, case group) consumed the sardine sandwich supplement three times per week for 8 weeks, fulfilling the requirements and completing the study. The present investigation showed that a sardine sandwich supplement had no effect on CRP levels among patients on HD. However, when participants were stratified according to tertiles of CRP distribution values at baseline, a reduction in CRP levels was found for those in the higher tertile, being higher for the case group (P = .047). Although diabetic patients were excluded from the analysis (eight in the sardine supplementation group and seven in the control group) a significant CRP reduction was found (P = .034). CONCLUSION: Although a supplement of low-dose n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids had no effect on the plasma high-sensitivity CRP of the supplemented group, a reduction in CRP levels was found when patients were stratified for tertiles of CRP (for the upper tertile) and diabetic status (for nondiabetic patients). These findings need to be further confirmed. This canned sardine supplement was accepted by an important proportion of patients, enhancing diet variety and contributing for a greater n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid intake.

17135223|t|Cost effectiveness of perindopril in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease using data from the EUROPA study.
17135223|a|BACKGROUND: The EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) trial has recently reported. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of perindopril in stable coronary heart disease in the UK. METHODS: Clinical and resource use data were taken from the EUROPA trial. Costs included drugs and hospitalisations. Health-related quality of life values were taken from published sources. A cost-effectiveness analysis is presented as a function of the risk of a primary event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death) in order to identify people for whom treatment offers greatest value for money. RESULTS: The median incremental cost of perindopril for each quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained across the heterogeneous population of EUROPA was estimated as 9700 pounds(interquartile range 6400-14,200 pounds). Overall, 88% of the EUROPA population had an estimated cost per QALY below 20,000 pounds and 97% below 30,000 pounds. For a threshold value of cost effectiveness of 30,000 pounds per QALY gained, treatment of people representing the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th centiles of the cost effectiveness distribution for perindopril has a probability of 0.999, 0.99 and 0.93 of being cost effective, respectively. Cost effectiveness was strongly related to higher risk of a primary event under standard care. CONCLUSIONS: Whether the use of perindopril can be considered cost effective depends on the threshold value of cost effectiveness of healthcare systems. For the large majority of patients included in EUROPA, the incremental cost per QALY gained was lower than the apparent threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.

16968895|t|Relationship of expression of aquaglyceroporin 9 with arsenic uptake and sensitivity in leukemia cells.
16968895|a|Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is highly efficacious in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation.

8018352|t|In vitro studies of intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity following 4 MeV photons or 62.5 MeV (p-->Be+) neutrons. Potential implications for high LET therapy.
8018352|a|Recent studies of the intrinsic cellular sensitivity of 30 human in vitro cell lines to 4 MeV photons and 62.5 MeV (p-->Be+) neutrons have identified relatively neutron sensitive cell lines with high alpha values within the more resistant end of the photon radiation response range. Here we present data comparing the surviving fraction at 2 Gy of photons (SF2) to the surviving fractions at 1.6, 0.85 and 0.6 Gy of neutrons respectively (SF1.6 SF0.85 and SF0.6). With the ratio SF2/SF1.6 a negative trend can be seen between the probability of a preferential response to neutrons and relative photon resistance. With a ratio of SF2/SF0.6, however, a highly significant benefit for 62.5 MeV neutrons can be seen in the more photon resistant lines. We suggest further clinical studies to explore the potential relevance of these in vitro findings to the clinical situation should be undertaken.

8513847|a|The effects of pretreatment with a seven day course of ciprofloxacin on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an intravenous (5 mg) dose of diazepam were investigated in a group of 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Ciprofloxacin pretreatment significantly reduced diazepam CL (without ciprofloxacin: 19.5 ml.h-1 kg-1; with ciprofloxacin: 12.3 ml.h-1 kg-1). Diazepam t1/2 was also prolonged (without ciprofloxacin: 36.7 h; with ciprofloxacin: 71.1 h), but volume of distribution was unaltered (without ciprofloxacin: 1.1 l.kg-1; with ciprofloxacin: 1.1 l.kg-1). However, no significant changes were detected in psychometric tests of digit symbol substitution, tapping rate and short memory, as well as levels of concentration, vigilance and tension measured by visual analogue scales.

15733541|t|The metabolism of nonane, a JP-8 jet fuel component, by human liver microsomes, P450 isoforms and alcohol dehydrogenase and inhibition of human P450 isoforms by JP-8.
15733541|a|Nonane, a component of jet-propulsion fuel 8 (JP-8), is metabolized to 2-nonanol and 2-nonanone by pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 1A2, 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize nonane to 2-nonanol, whereas alcohol dehydrogenase, CYPs 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize 2-nonanol to 2-nonanone. Nonane and 2-nonanol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of testosterone, estradiol or N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), but did inhibit carbaryl metabolism. JP-8 showed modest inhibition of testosterone, estradiol and carbaryl metabolism, but had a more significant effect on the metabolism of DEET. JP-8 was shown to inhibit CYPs 1A2 and 2B6 mediated metabolism of DEET, suggesting that at least some of the components of JP-8 might be metabolized by CYPs 1A2and/or 2B6.

20047912|t|Activity of dalbavancin against Bacillus anthracis in vitro and in a mouse inhalation anthrax model.
20047912|a|Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, can produce fatal disease when it is inhaled or ingested by humans. Dalbavancin, a novel, semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide, has potent activity, greater than that of vancomycin, against Gram-positive bacteria and a half-life in humans that supports once-weekly dosing. Dalbavancin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against B. anthracis (MIC range, < or =0.03 to 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(50) and MIC(90), 0.06 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively), which led us to test its efficacy in a murine inhalation anthrax model. The peak concentrations of dalbavancin in mouse plasma after the administration of single intraperitoneal doses of 5 and 20 mg/kg of body weight were 15 and 71 mg/kg, respectively. At 20 mg/kg, the dalbavancin activity was detectable for 6 days after administration (terminal half-life, 53 h), indicating that long intervals between doses were feasible. The mice were challenged with 50 to 100 times the median lethal dose of the Ames strain of B. anthracis, an inoculum that kills untreated animals within 4 days. The efficacy of dalbavancin was 80 to 100%, as determined by the rate of survival at 42 days, when treatment was initiated 24 h postchallenge with regimens of 15 to 120 mg/kg every 36 h (q36h) or 30 to 240 mg/kg every 72 h (q72h). A regimen of ciprofloxacin known to protect 100% of animals was tested in parallel. Delayed dalbavancin treatment (beginning 36 or 48 h postchallenge) with 60 mg/kg q36h or 120 mg/kg q72h still provided 70 to 100% survival. The low MICs and long duration of efficacy in vivo suggest that dalbavancin may have potential as an alternative treatment or for the prophylaxis of B. anthracis infections.

21676925|t|Role of Smac in determining the chemotherapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
21676925|a|PURPOSE: Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) regulates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Smac mimetics have been tested in clinical trials as chemosensitizers. We determined the role of Smac in modulating the chemosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Smac expression was evaluated in tissues from ESCC patients with differential chemotherapeutic responses. The effects of Smac knockdown and Smac mimetics on the chemosensitivity of ESCC cells and the molecular mechanisms by which Smac and Smac mimetics modulate chemosensitivity were determined. The therapeutic responses of ESCC cells with different Smac statuses were compared using xenograft models. RESULTS: We found that Smac was significantly downregulated in most ESCC samples (36.8%, 25/68, P = 0.001), and Smac expression differed significantly (P < 0.05) between chemosensitive and chemoresistant tumors. The associations of tested factors and their responses were examined using logistic regression analysis. In ESCC cells treated with cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic drug, Smac and cytochrome c were released from mitochondria, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 were activated. Knockdown of Smac abrogated cisplatin-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Smac deficiency also reduced the effect of cisplatin on long-term cell viability, and led to cisplatin resistance in xenograft tumors in vivo. LBW242, a small molecule Smac mimetic, enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and caspase activation and restored cisplatin sensitivity in Smac-deficient cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that downregulation of Smac may be a chemoresistance mechanism in ESCC. Combinations of Smac mimetics with chemotherapeutic agents may have therapeutic benefits for the treatment of esophageal cancer.

18155068|t|In vitro pharmacological characterization of CJ-042794, a novel, potent, and selective prostaglandin EP(4) receptor antagonist.
18155068|a|Activation of the prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) EP(4) receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), results in increases in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels via stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Here we describe the in vitro pharmacological characterization of a novel EP(4) receptor antagonist, CJ-042794 (4-{(1S)-1-[({5-chloro-2-[(4-fluorophenyl)oxy]phenyl}carbonyl)amino]ethyl}benzoic acid). CJ-042794 inhibited [(3)H]-PGE(2) binding to the human EP(4) receptor with a mean pK(i) of 8.5, a binding affinity that was at least 200-fold more selective for the human EP(4) receptor than other human EP receptor subtypes (EP(1), EP(2), and EP(3)). CJ-042794 did not exhibit any remarkable binding to 65 additional proteins, including GPCRs, enzymes, and ion channels, suggesting that CJ-042794 is highly selective for the EP(4) receptor. CJ-042794 competitively inhibited PGE(2)-evoked elevations of intracellular cAMP levels in HEK293 cells overexpressing human EP(4) receptor with a mean pA(2) value of 8.6. PGE(2) inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in human whole blood (HWB); CJ-042794 reversed the inhibitory effects of PGE(2) on LPS-induced TNFalpha production in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that CJ-042794, a novel, potent, and selective EP(4) receptor antagonist, has excellent pharmacological properties that make it a useful tool for exploring the physiological role of EP(4) receptors.

10422636|t|Modulation of acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves innervating guinea-pig and human trachea by endomorphin-1 and -2.
10422636|a|Endomorphin-1 and -2 (mu-opioid receptor agonists) produced a concentration-dependent and naloxone-sensitive inhibition of cholinergic contractile responses in guinea-pig trachea (at 10 microM, 46.1 +/- 8.0% and 33.8 +/- 8.6%, respectively). Endomorphin-1 and -2 also inhibited electrically-evoked acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerves innervating guinea-pig (at 0.1 microM, 41.8 +/- 10.9%; at 1 microM 60.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively) and human trachea (at 10 microM, 76.2 +/- 18.1%, and 77.7 +/- 14.3%, respectively). Naloxone prevented the inhibition by endomorphin-1 and -2 in both guinea-pig and human trachea, suggesting that these peptides can inhibit cholinergic, parasympathetic neurotransmission to the airways via the activation of classical opioid receptors.

21540404|t|Current treatment strategies for clozapine-induced sialorrhea.
21540404|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and current treatment options for clozapine-induced sialorrhea. DATA SOURCES: Literature was retrieved through MEDLINE (1977-February 2011) using the key search terms clozapine, sialorrhea, hypersalivation, drooling, and treatment. In addition, reference citations from identified publications were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles published in English identified from the data source were evaluated and included in the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sialorrhea is a common and disabling adverse effect of clozapine use. Current treatment options include topical and oral antimuscarinic medications and a-adrenergic agents. New areas of investigation include glycopyrrolate, botulinum toxin, and substitute benzamide derivatives. Thirteen clinical trials (2 retrospective, 5 open-label, 6 double-blind) and 13 case reports were reviewed. Overall, there are weak data on use of antimuscarinic agents, consisting mostly of small open-label or retrospective studies. Glycopyrrolate, however, demonstrated significant reduction of hypersalivation in a randomized controlled trial. Medications with activity at a-adrenergic receptors have shown positive results in case reports, retrospective evaluations, and an open-label trial, but have not been investigated in a double-blind, controlled fashion. Botulinum toxin also significantly improved sialorrhea in both a case report and double-blind study, although the trial included hypersalivation from other etiologies in addition to clozapine. Substitute benzamide derivatives have demonstrated significant improvements in randomized controlled trials; however, they are not available in the US. Overall, few treatment strategies have been evaluated in controlled settings, warranting further randomized controlled trials to identify more effective treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: Current pharmacologic treatment options for clozapine-induced sialorrhea are limited in number and efficacy. Although few randomized controlled trials have been conducted, this review identifies potential treatment alternatives for this common and sometimes severe adverse effect.

8417733|a|Since 1985, a number of reports have highlighted the effectiveness of a short course of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim as an adjuvant to immunosuppressive drugs in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis. We report our experience with long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. We describe recent advances in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis, suggest a complementary mechanism of action of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and advocate long-term sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy as a treatment option in Wegener's granulomatosis.

22610353|t|Phase II and gene expression analysis trial of neoadjuvant capecitabine plus irinotecan followed by capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: Hoosier Oncology Group GI03-53.
22610353|a|PURPOSE: We designed this study in locally advanced rectal cancer to determine the pathological response, toxicity, and disease-free survival (DFS) with induction capecitabine plus irinotecan followed by capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and analyze the gene expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of capecitabine and irinotecan for associations with response and toxicity. METHODS: Patients with T3/T4 or node positive rectal cancer were treated with capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) twice daily (BID) days 1-14, and irinotecan 200 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 days for 2 cycles, followed by capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) BID days 1-5 per week with concurrent radiotherapy 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Surgical resection occurred a median of 7.4 weeks after CRT. Gene expression levels or sequencing were used to analyze carboxylesterase-converting enzymes (CES1, CES2), thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), dehydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), topoisomerase I (TOPO I), and uridine-diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 in pre- and post-treatment tumor and normal tissue samples. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled, and 18 completed neoadjuvant therapy and underwent R0 resection. Two patients with UGT1A1 7/7 had grade 3 and 4 neutropenic fever and sepsis. Pathological complete response (pCR) occurred in 6 of 18 patients (33 %) and 10 (56 %) had tumor and/or nodal downstaging. The 3-year DFS was 75.5 % (95 % CI, 39.7-91.8 %). Locoregional control rate was 100 %. We observed higher TP gene expression in pCR patients, but no correlations with toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This neoadjuvant regimen was safe and demonstrated significant antitumor activity. High TP tumor gene expression was associated with obtaining pCR.

8409690|t|The effect of preliminary bowel preparation on a simple test of colonic transit in constipated subjects.
8409690|a|The abdominal distribution of orally ingested radioopaque markers is used to assess total and segmental colonic transit in constipated patients, but interpretation may depend on whether studies are carried out on a full colon or one cleared of faeces. We asked 25 severely constipated patients (age 18-74; 22 F, 3 M) to ingest 50 polyethylene markers (4 mm x 2 mm) at breakfast on 2 occasions 1 month apart. No bowel preparation was used for study 1 but for the second study 2 doses of Sodium Picosulphate (2 x 10 mg) were taken 3 days before ingestion of the markers. All subjects reported a good result which had ceased a day before taking the markers. Marker distribution was assessed by a plain abdominal film taken 72 hours after ingestion. All 25 subjects had more than 50% of markers present at 72 h in study one. Of these 4 showed evidence of outlet obstruction with more than 50% of ingested markers in the rectum. In the remaining 21 subjects markers were distributed throughout the colon in a pattern indicating colonic inertia. Following the administration of purgative there was no significant change in the mean number of markers retained but patterns of marker distribution for individual subjects did alter. Of the 21 patients who previously had colonic inertia, 3 showed outlet obstruction and 1 showed no evidence of delayed transit. Of the 4 patients with a pattern of outlet obstruction in the first study, 2 showed no evidence of delayed transit after Picolax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

24410906|t|Rifampicin mono-resistant tuberculosis in France: a 2005-2010 retrospective cohort analysis.
24410906|a|BACKGROUND: Rifampicin resistance is a risk factor for poor outcome in tuberculosis. Therefore, we sought to describe the characteristics and management of Rifampicin monoresistant (RMR) tuberculosis (TB) in France. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis in 2012 on RMR TB patients diagnosed in France between 2005 and 2010 by using a national laboratory network. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect basic demographic data, region of birth, history of TB, HIV-coinfection, alcohol use, and antituberculosis treatment. Outcome was assessed after at least 18 months of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with RMR TB were reported (0.12% of all TB cases). Overall, 19 (49%) had a previous history of treatment, 9 (23%) were HIV-coinfected, and 24 (62%) were smear-positive. Patient with secondary RMR were more likely to have alcohol abuse (P = 0.04) and HIV-coinfection (p = 0.04). Treatment outcome could be assessed for 30 patients, the nine others being dead or lost to follow-up. A total of 20 (67%) of the 30 assessed were cured, 3 (10%) died, 3 (10%) relapsed, and 4 (13%) were lost to follow up. Four (13%) received less than 6 months of treatment, 3 did not have any modification of the standardized regimen, 13 (43%) received fluoroquinolones, 4 (13%) aminoglycosides, and 8 (26%) a combination of both. CONCLUSIONS: RMR TB is a rare disease in France, and its management was heterogeneous. The lack of treatment standardization may be a consequence of low expertise and may lead to the unsatisfactory low success rate.

15385549|t|In vivo measurement of microtubule dynamics using stable isotope labeling with heavy water. Effect of taxanes.
15385549|a|Microtubules are dynamic polymers with central roles in the mitotic checkpoint, mitotic spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. Agents that block mitotic progression and cell proliferation by interfering with microtubule dynamics (microtubule-targeted tubulin-polymerizing agents (MTPAs)) are powerful antitumor agents. Effects of MTPAs (e.g. paclitaxel) on microtubule dynamics have not yet been directly demonstrated in intact animals, however. Here we describe a method that measures microtubule dynamics as an exchange of tubulin dimers into microtubules in vivo. The incorporation of deuterium ((2)H(2)) from heavy water ((2)H(2)O) into tubulin dimers and polymers is measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In cultured human lung and breast cancer cell lines, or in tumors implanted into nude mice, tubulin dimers and polymerized microtubules exhibited nearly identical label incorporation rates, reflecting their rapid exchange. Administration of paclitaxel during 24 h of (2)H(2)O labeling in vivo reduced (2)H labeling in polymers while increasing (2)H in dimers, indicating diminished flux of dimers into polymers (i.e. inhibition of microtubule dynamic equilibrium). In vivo inhibition of microtubule dynamics was dose-dependent and correlated with inhibition of DNA replication, a stable isotopic measure of tumor cell growth. In contrast, microtubule polymers from sciatic nerve of untreated mice were not in dynamic equilibrium with tubulin dimers, and paclitaxel increased label incorporation into polymers. Our results directly demonstrate altered microtubule dynamics as an important action of MTPAs in vivo. This sensitive and quantitative in vivo assay of microtubule dynamics may prove useful for pre-clinical and clinical development of the next generation of MTPAs as anticancer drugs.

16528470|t|Translocation of AIF in the human and rat striatum following protracted haloperidol, but not clozapine treatment.
16528470|a|Loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and consequent release of apoptogenic factors may be involved in mediating striatal neurodegeneration after prolonged treatment with the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), an intramitochondrial protein, may have a large influence on mediating haloperidol-induced striatal neuron destruction. Translocation of this protein from mitochondria to the nucleus promotes cell death independently of the caspase cascade. To examine how AIF may contribute to haloperidol-induced apoptosis, AIF translocation was observed in three haloperidol treatment paradigms. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with both haloperidol and clozapine and examined for AIF immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry was also performed on human striatal sections obtained from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium and on rat brain sections following 28 days of antipsychotic drug treatment. In the cellular model haloperidol, but not clozapine treatment increased the nuclear AIF immunofluorescent signal and decreased cell viability. Corollary to these findings, striatal sections from patients who had taken haloperidol and rats who were administered haloperidol both had an elevated nuclear AIF signal. The results provide novel evidence implicating the involvement of AIF in haloperidol-associated apoptosis and its relevance to the development of typical antipsychotic drug-related adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia.

16601809|a|Quinazolines - 1,3-benzodiazines are biological active compounds, which are used in the phamaceutical industry, in agriculture and in the medicine. As documented in the literature, many derivatives demonstrated anticancer activity and they act as multitarget agents. 3-(5-Nitro-2-thienyl)-9-chloro-5-morpholin-4-yl[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c] quinazoline (NTCHMTQ) - a new synthetically prepared quinazoline derivative was the most effective derivative in our primary cytotoxic screening. In this study, we evaluated cytotoxic/antiproliferative activity of NTCHMTQ using human tumor cell line HeLa. Possible interaction of 3-(5-nitro-2-thienyl)-9-chloro-5-morpholin-4-yl[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c] quinazoline with calf thymus DNA was tested by the DNA - modified screen - printed electrode. Quinazoline derivative acted cytotoxically on tumor cell line HeLa. The IC(100) value was 10 microg/ml. The IC(50) values was found to be less than 4 microg/ml, a limit put forward by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for classification of he compound as a potential anticancer drug. Quinazoline at micromolar concentrations induced morphological changes and necrosis of HeLa cells. Using the DNA based electrochemical biosensor, we have not found damage to DNA under in vitro conditions at an incubation of the biosensor in mixture with quinazoline.

21033247|t|The effect of differentiating and apoptotic agents on notch signalling pathway in hepatoblastoma.
21033247|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Notch expression is not yet determined in hepatoblastoma. In this study the effect of chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, doxorubicin, cytosin arabinoside); differentiating agent (13 cis-retinoic acid) and apoptotic agents (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, arsenic trioxide) on notch expression in hepatoblastoma were evaluated. METHODOLOGY: After HepG2 cell line was cultured and the agents and their combinations were applied for 24 hour in pre-optimized 50% lethal doses, RNA isolation and cDNA converting, expression of 84 custom array genes of notch signaling pathway (SABiosciences, PAT059F-24) was determined by Real Time PCR. The methylation status of 6 genes that showed more than 5 fold changes compared with control group were explored by Methylation qPCR Assay. High expressed genes are HDAC1, NFKB1, CHUK, CDKN1A, and CBL. Low expressed genes are DLL1, CD44, FZD2, GLI1, IL17B, LMO2, NOTCH1, LOR, PAX5, PT-CRA, SH2D1A, and WISP1. The genes searched for methylation (DLL1, HEY1, DTX1, HDAC1, NOTCH2 and JAG1) were not found to be related with methylation. RESULTS: The high expressed genes are related with cell proliferation. The main signaling genes that are closed to notch in signaling pathway are low expressed in hepatoblastoma. The agents do not show prominent effect of gene expression in many genes and methylation is not the reason of expression changes. The use of retinoic acid in the control of minimal residual disease of hepatoblastoma should be discussed. 5 aza "cytidin" the demethylating agent is not advised in treatment according to our results. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin as main chemotherapeutic agent treatment is shown to change gene expression levels in notch signalling pathway in hepatoblastoma.

24080792|t|Risk factors of y-hydroxybutyrate overdosing.
24080792|a|The aim of this study was to identify in recreational drug users the factors which increase the risk of overdosing (OD) with y-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). A purposive sample of 45 experienced GHB users was interviewed, equally divided into three groups (never OD, occasional OD, and repeat OD). The repeat OD group scored highest on many risk factors regarding GHB use, the occasional OD group scored intermediate, and the never OD group scored lowest. Participants, whether or not they had overdosed on GHB, most often perceived GHB use (e.g. using more GHB than usual, using GHB doses too closely together) as the main reason for GHB OD, and many participants who had overdosed on GHB reported that they had taken more GHB than usual at their most recent occasion of GHB OD. No significant differences in co-use of GHB with other substances were found between the three groups. Our findings indicate that using GHB in the company of groups of friends probably reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of OD.

12915773|t|Results of double-blind placebo-controlled challenge with nickel salts in patients affected by recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
12915773|a|BACKGROUND: The aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) has so far not been completely clarified. Recently, several studies reported that patients affected by cutaneous diseases (i.e. dermatitis, eczema and urticaria) with positive patch test to nickel have a positive oral nickel challenge. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective data analysis of patch test and oral nickel challenge in 380 patients (204 women and 176 men) affected by RAS was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 380 consecutive patients affected by RAS during the period 1990-1999. In 28/380 patients the appearance of their oral symptoms coincided with the fitting of orthodontic appliance, while 352/380 reported that their oral symptoms worsened after the fitting of orthodontic appliance. All patients were studied with the series (European standard series and series for dental materials) for patch tests. RESULTS: Seventy out of 380 patients (18.4%) presented a contact sensitization to nickel sulphate (positive patch test). In all of these, the orthodontic appliance was replaced with one made of nickel-free materials. All patients were re-examined by the dentist 6 months after the removal of the orthodontic appliance. The symptoms had completely remitted in 28/70 patients, partially had improved in 31/70 patients and had remained unchanged in 11/70 patients. In all patients (n = 70) with a positive patch test to nickel we performed an oral double-blind placebo-controlled challenge (DBPC) test with nickel sulphate. The DBPC was positive in 32/70 patients, 21 of whom had partially improved and 11 had not, even after the replacement of the orthodontic appliance with material not containing nickel. None of the 28 patients in complete remission showed an adverse reaction to oral nickel challenge. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that, in some patients with a positive patch test to nickel sulphate, the perpetuation of RAS can be related to a hypersensitivity to ingested nickel salts, independently of local contact to nickel.

22249124|a|Two click chemistry-derived focused libraries based on the benz[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one scaffold were synthesized and screened against Dengue virus and West Nile virus NS2B-NS3 proteases. Several compounds (4l, 7j-n) displayed noteworthy inhibitory activity toward Dengue virus NS2B-NS3 protease in the absence and presence of added detergent. These compounds could potentially serve as a launching pad for a hit-to-lead optimization campaign.

22743330|t|Mitochondria: mitochondrial membranes in brain ageing and neurodegeneration.
22743330|a|Mitochondria are membrane bound organelles that provide cellular energy in form of ATP. In addition to ATP synthesis mitochondria are key regulators of calcium homeostasis, free radical production, steroid synthesis and apoptosis, each of these factors could also be associated with essential mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies revealed that changes in mitochondria membrane fluidity might have a direct impact on membrane-based processes such as fission-associated morphogenic changes, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or oxidative phosphorylation at the complexes of the electron transport chain. We investigated synaptosomal plasma and mitochondrial membranes isolated from brains of mouse models for ageing, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Membrane properties are disease specifically altered, identifying mitochondrial membranes as targets for possible therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Bioenergetic dysfunction, adaptation and therapy.

11014215|t|Transcriptional down-regulation of human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor gene by GnRH: role of protein kinase C and activating protein 1.
11014215|a|Clinical applications of GnRH agonists (GnRHa) are based primarily on the decrease in gonadotropin release after down-regulation of the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) by continuous GnRHa administration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of the human GnRHR gene after prolonged GnRH treatment remain poorly understood. In the present study GnRHa-mediated regulation of human GnRHR gene transcription was studied by transiently transfecting the mouse gonadotrope-derived (alphaT3-1) cells with a 2297-bp human GnRHR promoter-luciferase construct (p2300-LucF). A dose- and time-dependent decrease in human GnRHR promoter activity was observed after GnRHa treatment. An average 71% decrease in promoter activity was observed after 24-h treatment with 0.1 microM GnRHa, which was blocked by cotreatment of the GnRH antagonist, antide. This effect was mimicked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) administration. In addition, the GnRHa- and TPA-mediated decrease in the human GnRHR promoter activity was reversed by a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X, or depletion of PKC by TPA pretreatment. These findings indicate that the activation of the PKC pathway is important in regulating the human GnRHR gene expression. By progressive 5'-deletion studies, we have identified a 248-bp DNA fragment (-1018 to -771, relative to the translation start site) at the 5'-flanking region of the human GnRHR gene that is responsible for the GnRHa-mediated down-regulation of human GnRHR promoter activity. Analysis of this sequence reveals the existence of two putative activating protein-1 (AP-1) sites with 87% homology to the consensus sequence (5'-TGA(G/C)T(C/A)A-3'), located at -1000 to -994 (5'-TTAGACA-3', in complementary orientation) and -943 to 937 (5'-TGAATAA-3'). Using competitive gel mobility shift assays, AP-1 binding was observed within this 248-bp region. Site-directed mutation of the putative AP-1-binding site located at -1000 to -994 abolished the GnRHa-induced inhibition. Further competitive GMSA and supershift experiments confirmed the identity of AP-1 binding in this region. By the use of Western blot analysis, a significant increase in c-Jun (100%; P < 0.05) and c-Fos (50%; P < 0.05) protein levels was observed after GnRHa treatment in alphaT3-1 cells. In addition, our data suggested that a change in AP-1 composition, particularly c-Fos, was important in mediating GnRHa-induced inhibition of human GnRHR gene expression. We conclude that activation of the PKC pathway by GnRH is important in controlling human GnRHR gene expression. In addition, the putative AP-1-binding site located at -1000 to -994 of the human GnRHR5'-flanking region has been functionally identified to be involved in mediating this down-regulatory effect.

11017921|t|Mechanisms of proliferation synergy by receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptor activation in human airway smooth muscle.
11017921|a|Despite recent studies depicting the capacity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to activate mitogenic signaling pathways more commonly associated with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), little is known regarding the interactive effects of GPCR and RTK activation on cell growth and signal transduction. Such interactions likely mediate the physiologic growth in most cells in vivo as well as the aberrant, non-neoplastic growth that occurs in diseases such as asthma, where disruptions of the local hormonal or inflammatory state can contribute to significant GPCR activation. In this study, we show that numerous inflammatory or contractile agents, including thrombin, histamine, and carbachol, potentiate epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated proliferation of human airway smooth muscle (ASM), thus demonstrating a clear synergy between RTK and GPCR activation. Alterations in promitogenic nuclear signaling were evidenced by additive or synergistic increases in Elk-1 and activator protein-1 activation, and by increases in cyclin D1 expression. Interestingly, GPCR activation did not cause EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation nor did it increase EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation. In the presence of EGF, histamine or carbachol did not alter the time-dependent phosphorylation of p42/p44, whereas thrombin was capable of increasing phospho-p42/p44 levels at selected time points in some, but not all, cultures. In contrast to their relative inability to alter EGF receptor-linked p42/p44 activation, thrombin, histamine, and carbachol consistently increased the late phase (> 1 h) activity of p70 S6 kinase. Collectively, these findings suggest that inflammatory and contractile agents that activate GPCRs can significantly modulate RTK-mediated ASM growth through a p70 S6 kinase-dependent, p42/p44-independent mechanism.

12954579|t|Intravenous ibandronate reduces the incidence of skeletal complications in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.
12954579|a|BACKGROUND: This phase III study compared the efficacy of the new potent bisphosphonate, ibandronate, with placebo as intravenous (i.v.) therapy in metastatic bone disease due to breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 466 patients were randomised to receive placebo (n = 158), or 2 mg (n = 154) or 6 mg (n = 154) ibandronate every 3-4 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary efficacy parameter was the number of 12-week periods with new bone complications, expressed as the skeletal morbidity period rate (SMPR). Bone pain, analgesic use and safety were evaluated monthly. Results SMPR was lower in both ibandronate groups compared with the placebo group; the difference was statistically significant for the ibandronate 6 mg group (P = 0.004 versus placebo). Consistent with the SMPR, ibandronate 6 mg significantly reduced the number of new bone events (by 38%) and increased time to first new bone event. Patients on ibandronate 6 mg also experienced decreased bone pain scores and analgesic use. Treatment with ibandronate was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 6 mg i.v. ibandronate is effective and safe in the treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer.

8209399|t|Signal transduction defect in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and AIDS-related complex.
8209399|a|Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related complex (ARC), and heterosexual controls were stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or both and 3H thymidine incorporation and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha; CD25; Tac antigen) expression were measured. In addition, basal plasma membrane potential and plasma membrane potential following anti-CD3 stimulation were compared between the three groups. A significantly reduced DNA synthesis and CD25 expression was observed in both AIDS and ARC upon stimulation with anti-CD3 or PMA. Although, a significant synergism was observed with anti-CD3 plus PMA stimulation in both AIDS and ARC, and the responses were normalized to the levels of anti-CD3 or PMA response in normal control, the levels were significantly lower than those observed with anti-CD3 plus PMA in controls. Plasma membrane potentials were decreased (membrane depolarized) in both ARC and AIDS (AIDS > ARC), and anti-CD3 had no effect on further depolarization of plasma membrane in AIDS. These data suggest a defect in signal transduction pathway in patients with HIV-1 infection.

19032560|t|Intrathecal ropivacaine 5 mg/ml for outpatient knee arthroscopy: a comparison with lidocaine 10 mg/ml.
19032560|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective, randomised, blind study was to compare the evolution of spinal block produced with 50 mg lidocaine 10 mg/ml and 10 mg ropivacaine 5 mg/ml for outpatient knee arthroscopy. METHODS: Thirty outpatients undergoing knee arthroscopy received 50 mg of lidocaine 10 mg/ml (n=15) or 10 mg of ropivacaine 5 mg/ml (n=15) intrathecally. The evolution of spinal block was recorded until home discharge, while the occurrence of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) was evaluated through phone-call follow-ups. RESULTS: The median onset time was 15 (10-21) min with lidocaine and 24 (11-37) min with ropivacaine (P=0.109). Spinal lidocaine resulted in a faster resolution of sensory block [148 (130-167) min vs. 188 (146-231) (P=0.022)], unassisted ambulation with crutches [176 (144-208) min vs. 240 (179-302) min (P=0.014)], and voiding [208 (163-254) min vs. 293 (242-343) min (P=0.001)] than ropivacaine. Recovery of motor function required 113 (95-131) min with lidocaine and 135 (87-183) with ropivacaine (P=0.219). Six lidocaine patients reported TNS (40%) as compared with no patient receiving ropivacaine (0%) (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal block produced with 10 mg ropivacaine 5 mg/ml is as effective as that produced by 50 mg of lidocaine 10 mg/ml. Recovery of unassisted ambulation and spontaneous voiding occurred earlier with lidocaine, but this was associated with a markedly higher incidence of TNS.

12668916|t|Sequence diversity and functional characterization of the 5'-regulatory region of human CYP2C19.
12668916|a|Cytochrome p4502C19 (CYP2C19) plays an important role in drug biotransformation and has been shown to be genetically polymorphic. While polymorphisms in the coding region that have large effects on activity are well described, until recently, a lack of knowledge of the promoter sequence has hindered efforts to study it. Genetic variants in the promoter region have not been described and factors that influence its gene expression via promotor regulation remain largely undefined. We have cloned and sequenced 1.8 kb of the human CYP2C19 promoter. This promoter contains a number of putative transcription factor sites, including HepG2-specific factor 1, glucocorticoid response element, estrogen receptor element, constitutive androstane receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Sequencing of DNA obtained from 67 individuals identified eight single nucleotide polymorphisms within this region. No sequence of a known human pregnane X receptor response element was found in this section of the CYP2C19 promoter, despite the known effect of rifampin on the expression of this gene. A plasmid containing the 1.8-kb CYP2C19 promoter coupled to a luciferase reporter gene has been constructed and demonstrated to be functional and sensitive to induction by omeprazole in HuH7 cells. Nested deletions of CYP2C19 promoter were generated and the ability of serial promoter deletion constructs to activate luciferase expression in the HepG2 cell line was analysed. These data make possible future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CYP2C19 can be induced in clinical settings and the consequences of genetic variability in its promoter.

7625725|t|Glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 reverses agonist-induced apoptosis and c-myc repression in human leukemic CEM-C7 cells.
7625725|a|A synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of clone CEM-C7 cells, but not in clone CEM-C1 cells, even though they contain glucocorticoid receptors (GR). We previously showed that suppression of c-myc is a critical step in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis of C7 cells. It is not reduced in C1 cells. In this study we review the basis for this conclusion and present evidence that the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 rescues DEX-treated C7 cells from cell death. An increase in DEX-repressed c-myc mRNA levels precedes the recovery of cell growth. A threshold level of Myc expression appears to be required to maintain growth and viability of C7 cells. Although C1 cells are highly resistant to lysis by glucocorticoids, addition of forskolin, an inducer of protein kinase A, synergizes to evoke complete apoptosis. This synergistic effect is prevented by RU 486, indicating direct involvement of the GR.

11882583|t|Role of methoxyestradiols in the growth inhibitory effects of estradiol on human glomerular mesangial cells.
11882583|a|Metabolism of locally applied 17beta-estradiol (estradiol) to methoxyestradiols contributes to the growth inhibiting effects of estradiol on vascular smooth muscle cells via an estrogen receptor (ER)-independent mechanism. Because vascular smooth muscle cells are phenotypically similar to glomerular mesangial cells, it is feasible that estradiol inhibits glomerular mesangial cell growth via a similar mechanism, and this possibility was investigated. In human glomerular mesangail cells, estradiol concentration dependently (1 to 100 nmol/L) inhibited serum-induced proliferation (cell number) and DNA ((3)[H]-thymidine incorporation) and collagen ((3)[H]-proline incorporation) synthesis. The inhibitory effects of estradiol were mimicked by 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-methoxyestradiol, metabolites of estradiol with little affinity for ERs. 2-Hydroxyestradiol and 2-methoxyestradiol were more potent growth inhibitors than estradiol. The inhibitory effects of estradiol were enhanced by CYP450 inducers 3-methylcholanthrene (10 micromol/L) and phenobarbital (10 micromol/L) and blocked by the CYP450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (10 micromol/L). The growth inhibitory effects of estradiol were also blocked by quercetin (10 micromol/L) and OR 486 (10 micromol/L) inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (converts catecholestradiols to methoxyestradiols). ICI182780 (ER antagonist with ER binding affinity similar to estradiol) blocked the growth inhibitory effects of estradiol (1 to 100 nmol/L) only at concentrations (>50 micromol/L) that inhibited estradiol metabolism to catecholestradiols. The growth inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol were abrogated by quercetin and OR486 (two structurally dissimilar catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors), but not by ICI182780. However, the growth inhibitory effects of 2-methoxyestradiol were unaltered by catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and ICI182780. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that methoxyestradiols mediate the growth inhibitory effects of locally applied estradiol on glomerular mesangial cell growth via an ER-independent mechanism.

22385030|t|Male skin and ingredients relevant to male skin care.
22385030|a|Male skin care needs are heavily influenced by the need to remove facial hair on a regular basis. Facial skin issues associated with poor hair removal approaches are common and include razor burn and irritation. This paper evaluates current research on shaving technology and how careful ingredient selection can contribute to male skin health. The importance of maintaining hair softness during the shave and restoring facial hydration post-shave is discussed. Data are presented on how post-shave moisturizers containing glycerine and emollients can create an environment for improved barrier function which can be further improved by incorporating specific ingredients such as niacinamide.

22288970|t|Progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to cosmetic subcutaneous silicone injections in a patient with HIV-1 infection: case report and review of the literature.
22288970|a|Silicone, commonly used in cosmetic procedures owing to its presumed inertness, can yield serious sequelae including acute embolization and pneumonitis. Chronic pulmonary sequelae in response to silicone injection have not been previously described. We report a case of chronic progressive granulomatous pneumonitis in response to subcutaneous silicone injections in a transgender male-to-female patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). After receiving silicone injections to the buttock, the patient developed rapid onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever, and chills. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse peripheral interstitial opacities. She responded symptomatically to prednisone with subsequent intermittent symptomatic flares. Four years later, she developed marked dyspnea and cough. Chest computed tomography showed progressive diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities. Lung biopsies demonstrated numerous spheroid silicone particles within the lung interstitium and small pulmonary vessels, surrounded by foreign body giant cells and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation. We speculate that HIV-1-infected patients may be at risk for chronic, progressive granulomatous pneumonitis due to silicone injection years after their procedure owing to shifting levels of cell-mediated immunity.

17142654|t|Intravenous acetaminophen vs oral ibuprofen in combination with morphine PCIA after Cesarean delivery.
17142654|a|PURPOSE: To compare the effects of iv acetaminophen with those of oral ibuprofen with respect to postoperative pain control and morphine requirements in patients receiving morphine patient-controlled iv analgesia (PCIA) after Cesarean delivery. METHODS: Forty-five term patients scheduled for Cesarean delivery were randomized to receive acetaminophen 1 g iv every six hours plus oral placebo (group A) or ibuprofen 400 mg po every six hours plus iv placebo (group I); the first dose of study drug was given 30 min preoperatively. Postoperatively, all patients received PCIA for 48 hr using morphine bolus dose 2 mg iv, lockout interval ten minutes, and no basal infusion. Visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 10) at rest and morphine requirements were recorded every hour for four hours then every four hours for a total of 48 hr postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was recorded on a ten-point scale (from 1 to 10) 48 hr postoperatively. RESULTS: Visual analogue scale scores decreased similarly in both groups over time, however, there were no differences between groups at any time during the study period (estimated marginal means: 1.4 +/- SEM 0.2 vs 1.9 +/- SEM 0.2 for groups A and I, respectively, P = 0.124). Cumulative doses of postoperative morphine were 98 +/- 37 vs 93 +/- 33 mg for groups A and I, respectively (P = 0.628). Patient satisfaction with analgesia was high in both groups (9 +/- 1 vs 9 +/- 1, P = 0.93). CONCLUSION: Intravenous acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative to oral ibuprofen as an adjunct to morphine patient-controlled analgesia after Cesarean delivery.

24881920|t|Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with hemolytic crisis developed twenty years after the onset of Evans syndrome.
24881920|a|A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in May 1992. One month later, her PRCA went into remission following treatment but she developed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and was diagnosed with Evans syndrome. Although her condition resolved with administration of prednisolone and azathioprine, it was necessary to continue treatment with gradual tapering over the following two decades. In October 2012, her hemolytic anemia again worsened, and lymph node swelling, splenomegaly and B symptoms developed. She was diagnosed as having diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on lymph node biopsy. However, AIHA was not considered to be the cause of her hemolytic anemia, but rather to be related to DLBCL. This was because a Coombs test and other extensive investigations for Coombs negative-AIHA yielded negative results. The patient underwent CHOP therapy, and all of her symptoms improved. Herein, we report this rare case in which DLBCL developed after the onset of Evans syndrome.

17893628|t|Laxation of critically ill patients with lactulose or polyethylene glycol: a two-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
17893628|a|OBJECTIVE: To study whether lactulose or polyethylene glycol is effective to promote defecation in critically ill patients, whether either of the two is superior, and whether the use of enteral laxatives is related to clinical outcome. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. SETTING: Two tertiary intensive care units. PATIENTS: Three hundred and eight consecutive patients with multiple organ failure were included when receiving mechanical ventilation and intravenous circulatory support and when defecation did not occur on day 3 after admission. INTERVENTIONS: Thrice daily administration of lactulose, polyethylene glycol, or placebo until defecation occurred, to a maximum of 4 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of patients with defecation during the study period was 32 of 103 (31%) for placebo, 76 of 110 (69%) for lactulose, and 70 of 95 (74%) for polyethylene glycol (p = .001 for lactulose and polyethylene glycol vs. placebo). Lactulose and polyethylene glycol-treated patients produced stools after a median of 36 and 44 hrs, respectively, compared with 75 hrs for the placebo group (p = .001 for lactulose and polyethylene glycol vs. placebo). Length of stay in the intensive care unit was a median of 156 hrs for the lactulose group, 190 hrs for the polyethylene glycol group, and 196 hrs for the placebo group (p = .001). Intestinal pseudoobstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome occurred in 4.1% of patients in the placebo group, 5.5% of patients in the lactulose group, and 1.0% of patients in the polyethylene glycol group. There was no difference in hospital mortality. Administration of morphine was associated with a longer time before first defecation, except in the polyethylene glycol group. For all groups, defecation within 6 days after admission was associated with a shorter length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Both lactulose and polyethylene glycol are more effective in promoting defecation than placebo. Patients receiving polyethylene glycol had a slightly lower incidence of acute intestinal pseudoobstruction, whereas length of stay was shorter in lactulose-treated patients. Morphine administration was associated with delayed defecation except in the polyethylene glycol-treated group. Irrespective of study medication, early defecation was associated with a shorter length of stay.

17552871|t|An evidence for regulatory cross-talk between aryl hydrocarbon receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in HepG2 cells.
17552871|a|Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play crucial role in the regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and in many essential physiological processes. Cellular signaling by these receptors shares several functional and regulatory features. Here we investigated regulatory cross-talk between these two receptors. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were the model of choice. We analyzed the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) and dioxin (TCDD) on i) expression of AhR and GRalpha mRNAs; ii) levels of AhR and GR proteins; iii) transcriptional activities of AhR and GR in reporter assays; iv) 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD). We found that both DEX and TCDD affected AhR and GR mRNAs expression, proteins levels and transcriptional activities in HepG2 cells. These effects on cellular signaling by AhR and GR comprised up-/down-regulation of gene expression and ligand-dependent protein degradation. We conclude that interactive regulatory cross-talk between GR and AhR receptors in HepG2 cells defines possible implications in physiology and drug metabolism. Future research should be focused on the investigation of AhR-GR cross-talk in various normal human cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo.

9482768|t|Tolerance and breath hydrogen excretion following ingestion of maltitol incorporated at two levels into milk chocolate consumed by healthy young adults with and without fasting.
9482768|a|Little is known about the gastrointestinal effects of ingesting maltitol in chocolate. This study was designed to determine whether it leads to increased gastrointestinal symptomatology and if that symptomatology is dose related. It was also designed to discover whether breath hydrogen excretion in response to maltitol is dose related. In a double-blind, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers aged 18-24 y ingested 100 g chocolate containing 40 g sucrose, 10 g sucrose plus 30 g maltitol or 40 g maltitol after fasting (abstinence from food and liquids from 2200 h on the night before chocolate consumption) and not fasting. There was no difference in symptomatology between fasting and nonfasting periods, and consumption order had no effect on symptomatology. Relative to ingestion of sucrose, 30 g maltitol caused no significant difference in symptoms, but 40 g resulted in more mild borborygmi (P < 0.05) and mild flatulence (P < 0.01) but not moderate or severe symptoms. Neither 30 nor 40 g maltitol caused significantly greater laxation than sucrose ingestion (P > 0.05). In a separate study, 10 healthy volunteers aged 18-24 y ate the same test products before breath H2 testing; 40 g maltitol in chocolate caused a greater total breath H2 excretion compared with 30 g maltitol (P < 0.05) or sucrose (P < 0.01). Total breath hydrogen excretion was also greater with 30 g maltitol compared with sucrose (P < 0.05). This dose-related response was consistent with the lower symptomatology after ingestion of 30 vs. 40 g maltitol. We have shown that 30 g maltitol in chocolate causes no significant symptomatology in young adults; however, 40 g caused mild borborygmi and flatus but no increased laxation. An increased breath H2 response indicates colonic fermentation of this polyol.

14512914|t|Short course of oral cyclosporine in lichen planopilaris.
14512914|a|Lichen planopilaris is a rare inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology that causes permanent scalp hair loss. Current treatments for lichen planopilaris are limited and do not alter the eventual outcome of the disease. Oral cyclosporine has been successful in treating severe and refractory lichen planus of the skin, and has produced sustained remission in some patients. We present 3 patients with lichen planopilaris who were treated with a short course of oral cyclosporine and report their clinical features and responses, using a standardized method of patient assessment and 3 specific outcome measures. In all 3 patients alleviation of symptoms, resolution of clinical activity, and halting progression of hair loss was achieved in 3 to 5 months with sustained effect at 12 months after a short course of cyclosporine therapy.

16249642|t|Gemcitabine in the treatment of relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's disease.
16249642|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with refractory Hodgkin's disease or relapsing after high-dose therapy and autografting have a poor prognosis. Here, we present our experiences with gemcitabine in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease with gemcitabine. The treatment was given on a compassionate use basis, off-label and not according to a study protocol. Patients were 17-46 years of age. 1 patient had stage IA disease, 2 patients had stage IIIB disease and 11 patients had stage IVB disease. 9 patients had received radiotherapy. 8 patients had been autografted and 1 patient auto- and allografted. Gemcitabine was administered at a starting dose of 1 g/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks in combination with steroids. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 10 months. Hematological toxicity grade 3-4 occurred in 12 patients leading to dose reductions. 1 patient died of neutropenic sepsis. No other non-hematological toxicities were observed. The response rate was 64% with 6 patients achieving complete remission (CR) and 3 patients partial remission (PR). The median time to treatment failure was 9 months, and survival was 11 months. Responses were seen in previously transplanted patients and in patients refractory to previous treatment. The so far longest responder has been in CR for over 68 months. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine is an effective treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Heavily pretreated patients often require dose reductions.

8133152|t|Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity in the human term placenta: implications for fetal cocaine exposure.
8133152|a|The characterization of the enzymes responsible for drug metabolism in the human placenta is of great importance in determining the possible role the placenta plays in protecting the fetus from potentially fetotoxic drugs. We speculate that the placenta metabolizes cocaine, serving to protect the fetus from the drug's ill effects. Cholinesterase, the principle enzyme that metabolizes cocaine, has been hypothesized to be present yet is not well characterized in the human placenta. The purpose of this study was to quantify human placental acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Human placentas were obtained from elective cesarean sections, and several lobules were thoroughly perfused with cold buffer to ensure minimal contamination from erythrocyte AChE. Subcellular fractions were then prepared from these lobules by using standard differential centrifugation techniques. Microsomes and cytosol were assayed for AChE and BChE activity by using a spectrophotometric assay. BChE activity was found in the cytosolic fraction of the placental villous tissue, whereas AChE activity was measured in the microsomal fraction. By demonstrating that BChE activity is present in human term placenta we have shown that this organ has the capacity to metabolize cocaine and may therefore serve as a metabolic barrier to fetal exposure to cocaine.

16249641|t|Safety and efficacy of trastuzumab every 3 weeks combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive recurrent breast cancer: findings from a case series.
16249641|a|BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has been repeatedly shown to result in significant clinical benefits and was subsequently accepted as the treatment of choice for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer - particularly as first-line treatment in combination with taxanes and as monotherapy in the second-line or third-line setting. Trastuzumab is currently licensed as a weekly treatment, although a 3-weekly schedule could be used conveniently in combination with other cytotoxic agents that are administered on a 3-weekly basis in metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined the safety of i.v. trastuzumab (8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg) every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapeutic agents administered in 3-weekly courses (docetaxel, vinorelbine and capecitabine) in 31 patients with HER2-positive recurrent locoregional and/or metastatic breast cancer. RESULTS: 3-weekly trastuzumab appeared to be as well tolerated as the standard once-weekly schedule. All myelosuppressive adverse events and the majority of non-hematological adverse events were typical and characteristic of the individual concomitant cytotoxic agents. Transient trastuzumab-related infusion reactions occurred in 5 patients and 1 patient developed cardiac dysfunction, which recovered after discontinuation of trastuzumab. Efficacy appeared favourable: 18 clinical responses (3 complete and 15 partial) and 8 disease stabilizations gave an overall response rate of 58% (70% in the 20 patients receiving first-line therapy). Median progression-free and overall survival times were 9.9 months (95% CI: 6.3-13.5) and 23.1 months (95% CI: 19.2-27.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will likely encourage further evaluation of this more convenient 3-weekly trastuzumab regimen in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

8058633|t|Estradiol permeation from nonionic surfactant vesicles through human stratum corneum in vitro.
8058633|a|The permeation of estradiol from vesicular formulations through human stratum corneum was studied in vitro. The vesicles were composed of nonionic n-alkyl polyoxyethylene ether surfactants (CnEOm). The thermodynamic activity of estradiol present in each formulation was kept constant by saturating all formulations with estradiol. The effects of both the particle size and the composition of the formulation on estradiol permeation across excised human stratum corneum were investigated. Stratum corneum that was pretreated with empty surfactant carriers allowed for significantly higher estradiol fluxes compared with untreated stratum corneum. However, estradiol fluxes obtained in these pretreatment experiments appeared to be significantly lower than those obtained by the direct application of the estradiol-saturated carrier formulation on top of the stratum corneum. Furthermore, in the case of pretreatment of the stratum corneum, an increase in carrier size resulted in a decrease in estradiol flux. For direct application the opposite was found. Two mechanisms are proposed to play an important role in vesicle-skin interactions, i.e., the penetration enhancing effect of surfactant molecules and the effect of the vesicular structures that are most likely caused by adsorption of the vesicles at the stratum corneum-suspension interface.

15966509|t|Adult height in sixty girls with Turner syndrome treated with growth hormone matched with an untreated group.
15966509|a|The main clinical feature of Turner syndrome (TS) is growth failure, with a mean spontaneous adult height ranging between 136 and 147 cm, according to the specific curves of various populations. Though a classical deficiency of GH has not been generally demonstrated, GH has been administered since 1980 in trials, using replacement doses just initially, with a subsequent trend to increase it. We report the outcome of GH therapy given at the fixed dose of 0.33 mg/kg/week in 60 TS girls observed until adult height; 59 untreated TS girls, matched for auxological, karyotypical characteristics and time of observation, born within the same decade served as controls to evaluate GH efficacy. The calculation of the gain in cm over PAH was performed on specific Italian Turner curves, as well as height evaluation as SD score and growth velocity. The same calculations were made using Lyon references and Tanner standards. The mean CA at the beginning of GH treatment was 10.9 +/- 2.76 yr (range 4.5-15.9). Mean adult height of treated group was 151 +/- 6.1 cm with a gain over the PAH calculated at start of therapy (142.9 +/- 5.3 cm) of 8.2 +/- 3.9 cm. Ns change was observed between the PAH at first observation (143.6 +/- 7.0 cm) and adult height (144.3 +/- 5.6 cm) in the control group. Treatment was well tolerated, no relevant side effects were observed, glucose metabolism resulted no more affected than in untreated subjects, IGF-I levels remained within 2 SD. Our results in 60 TS girls, though the dose remained unchanged throughout the treatment, show a good response, characterized by a striking variability in each patient (mean gain in cm over PAH at adult height of 8.17 +/- 3.9, range 3-21 cm), and significant also in comparison with the control group. As the chronological age at start of therapy ranged between 4.5 to 15.9 yr, the results were further evaluated dividing the patients into two groups, according to the age, < or >11 yr. Thirty girls were <11 yr (mean 8.7 +/- 1.76 yr) and 30 were >11 yr (mean 13.2 +/- 1.4 yr). The gain in cm over the PAH in each group was, respectively, 8.1 +/- 3.4 and 8.2 +/- 4.3 cm without any significant difference between the two groups, showing no negative correlation between the CA at the beginning of GH and the response to treatment.

23932769|a|For most medically amenable conditions, adherence to drug therapy is a necessary condition for a successful outcome. Drug side effects, especially pain, can interfere with the desired outcome. We report a case of non-adherence due to severe pain associated with the topical use of clotrimazole 1% solution in the ear. Instillation of tetracaine 1% solution prior to the administration of the clotrimazole blocked the pain sensation allowing the patient to successfully complete the antifungal therapy.

9389843|t|Caudal tramadol for postoperative analgesia in pediatric hypospadias surgery.
9389843|a|Ninety boys, aged 13-53 months, undergoing repair of hypospadias, were allocated randomly to receive 0.8 ml kg-1 of one of three solutions into the caudal extradural space: group B received bupivacaine 2 mg kg-1, group T received tramadol 2 mg kg-1 in 0.9% saline and group BT a mixture of both. Postoperative pain was assessed hourly for 12 h after injection using a modified TPPPS pain score and additional analgesia was administered to those children whose pain scores were > 3/10. Nine patients (30%) in group T required additional analgesia within 1 h of surgery compared with only two (6.7%) and three (10%) patients in groups B and BT, respectively (P = 0.04). Mean duration before additional analgesia was required in the remaining patients was 9.3 (SD 3.0) h in group B, 10.7 (2.2) h in group T and 10.5 (2.0) h in group BT (P > 0.20). There were no significant differences between the groups in mean ventilatory frequency, sedation scores, incidence of emesis, facial flushing or pruritus. We conclude that caudal tramadol had a slow onset of action and that the addition of tramadol to bupivacaine, when both drugs were administered caudally, did not significantly prolong the duration of action of bupivacaine.

20488410|t|Optical coherence tomography assessment of in vivo vascular response after implantation of overlapping bare-metal and drug-eluting stents.
20488410|a|OBJECTIVES: We designed a randomized trial exploiting optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess coverage and apposition of overlapping bare-metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES) in human coronary arteries. BACKGROUND: Overlapping DES impair healing in animals. Optical coherence tomography allows accurate in vivo assessment of stent strut coverage and apposition. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with long coronary stenoses were randomized to overlapping sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES), or BMS. The primary goal of the study was to determine the rate of uncovered/malapposed struts in overlap versus nonoverlap segments, according to stent type, at 6-month follow-up with OCT. RESULTS: A total of 53,047 struts were analyzed. The rate of uncovered/malapposed struts was 1.5 +/- 3.4% and 0.6 +/- 2.7% in overlap versus nonoverlap BMS (p = NS), respectively, and 4.3 +/- 11% and 3.6 +/- 8% in overlap versus nonoverlap DES (p = NS), respectively. There were no differences in the rates of uncovered/malapposed struts between overlapping BMS and DES, likely due to low frequency of uncovered/malapposed struts in ZES (0.1 +/- 0.4%), which offset the higher rates observed in SES (6.7 +/- 9.6%) and PES (6.7 +/- 16.5%, p < 0.05). Overlap segments showed greater neointimal volume obstruction versus nonoverlap segments in all DES (p < 0.05 for all DES types). Strut-level neointimal thickness at overlap and nonoverlap segments were lowest in SES (0.16 +/- 0.1 mm and 0.12 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively) compared with PES (0.27 +/- 0.1 mm and 0.20 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively), ZES (0.40 +/- 0.16 mm and 0.33 +/- 0.13 mm, respectively), and BMS (0.55 +/- 0.31 mm and 0.53 +/- 0.25 mm, respectively, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As assessed by OCT the impact of DES on vascular healing was similar at overlapping and nonoverlapping sites. However, strut malapposition, coverage pattern, and neointimal hyperplasia differ significantly according to DES type.

8451095|t|Dilemmas in diagnosis and management of cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis.
8451095|a|We recently managed an infant with meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in whom ceftriaxone failed to sterilize the cerebrospinal fluid after 6 days of therapy. This strain, which had a penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 micrograms/ml, appeared susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC < 0.5 micrograms/ml) when evaluated by a commercial MIC panel (Microtech Medical Systems, Inc., Aurora, CO) but was found to have a ceftriaxone MIC of 4 micrograms/ml when evaluated by conventional microtiter broth dilution technique. Furthermore ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis induced with this strain in a rabbit model was ineffective. Thirteen of 112 pneumococcal strains (11.6%) isolated recently at Children's Medical Center of Dallas were penicillin-resistant, and 3 of these were highly penicillin-resistant (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml). The incidence of pneumococcal strains with cefotaxime MICs > or = 1.0 micrograms/ml has increased from 0 of 258 from 1981 to 1983 to 5 of 112 (4.5%) from 1991 to 1992. The definition of cephalosporin resistance for pneumococci requires modification and further studies of the antibiotic management of meningitis caused by such strains are needed because resistance to cephalosporins is increasing and the extended spectrum cephalosporins may be ineffective as sole therapy.

11192510|t|Isolation and characterisation of an anticryptococcal protein in human cerebrospinal fluid.
11192510|a|An earlier study reported that human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has fungistatic activity for Cryptococcus neoformans. The present study reports that molecular sieve fractionation of concentrated CSF yielded three protein peaks, one of which (p2) had anticryptococcal activity. On a DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange column the active molecular sieve peak (p2) gave two peaks that contained anticryptococcal activity. The first (DEAE-1) eluted with 0.1 M NaCl and the second (DEAE-2) eluted with 0.2 M NaCl in buffer. Fungistatic activity of DEAE-1 was reversed by FeCl3. Moreover, FeCl3 reversed inhibition of C. neoformans growth by CSF. In contrast, activity of DEAE-2 was not reversed by FeCl3, indicating that inhibition was produced by an iron-independent mechanism. Immunoblot assays showed that transferrin was present in DEAE-1 but not in DEAE-2, whereas albumin was present in DEAE-2 but not in DEAE-1. On NuPAGE, DEAE-1 protein migrated as a single band corresponding to transferrin and DEAE-2 protein gave a single band corresponding to albumin. In control experiments, human serum albumin subjected to the same isolation protocol acquired anticryptococcal activity similar to that of DEAE-2. Therefore, CSF albumin (DEAE-2) activity was associated with the isolation protocol. These data indicate that transferrin, present in or isolated from CSF, sequesters trace amounts of ferric iron, inhibits growth of C. neoformans and acts as an innate defence mechanism.

16093866|t|131I-Labelled-iodized oil for palliative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
16093866|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is growing in western countries. Poor liver status and tumour size make curative options scarce. Palliative treatments such as chemo-embolization are improving survival in selected patients, but side-effects are frequent. There is a need for the validation of alternative treatments. Metabolic radiotherapy using lipiodol labelled with 131I-iodine (I-131-lipiodol) is one of these treatments. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of I-131-lipiodol in a population of advanced HCC patients and to define the potential prognostic factors in this setting. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the effect of I-131-lipiodol on 29 patients bearing multifocal tumours was performed. An analysis of two subgroups, defined by a Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score of 2 or less (n=20) or greater than 2 (n=9) was performed to assess the prognostic significance of the score in this setting. RESULTS: Overall median survival in the entire study population was 203 days (95% confidence interval 83-322 days). Median survival was significantly better in the group with CLIP scores of 2 or less than in the group with CLIP scores greater than 2 (453 versus 60 days, P< or =0.001). Treatment-related mortality was 6.9% (one interstitial pneumonia and one acute liver failure). CONCLUSION: The survival of patients treated with I-131-lipiodol in this series compared favourably with published data. Stratification according to the CLIP score was useful to predict survival. In particular, patients with portal vein thrombosis should only be considered for I-131-lipiodol if the CLIP score is lower than 2.

20804622|t|Effect of combination of taurine and azelaic acid on antimelanogenesis in murine melanoma cells.
20804622|a|BACKGROUND: Pigmentation in human skin is an important defense mechanism against sunlight or oxidative stress. Despite the protective role of melanin, abnormal hyperpigmentation such as freckles and chloasma sometimes can be serious aesthetic problems. Because of these effects of hyperpigmentation, people have considered the effect of depigmentation. Azelaic acid (AZ) is a saturated dicarboxylic acid found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley. Previously, we showed that AZ inhibited melanogenesis. In this study, we investigated the antimelanogenic activity of combination of AZ and taurine (Tau) in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. METHODS: The mouse melanoma cell line B16F10 was used in the study. We measured melanin contents and tyrosinase activity. To gain the change of protein expression, we carried out western blotting. RESULTS: We investigated that AZ combined with taurine (Tau) show more inhibitory effects in melanocytes than the treatment of AZ alone. AZ combined with Tau inhibited the melanin production and tyrosinase activity of B16F10 melanoma cells without significant cytotoxicity. Also inhibitory effects after treatment with these combined chemical are stronger than AZ alone on melanogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that AZ with Tau might play an important role in the regulation of melanin formation and be useful as effective ingredients in antimelanogesis.

10961766|t|Prednisone as initial treatment of analgesic-induced daily headache.
10961766|a|The majority of the patients who seek medical care in tertiary headache centres present with transformed migraine, and convert to daily headache, as a result of excessive intake of symptomatic medications (SM). This study aimed to analyse the possibility of using a short course of oral prednisone for detoxifying patients with chronic daily headache due to medication overuse in an out-patient setting. Four hundred patients with headache occurring more than 28 days per month for longer than 6 months were studied (mean baseline frequency of 0.96). Symptomatic medications were stopped suddenly and prednisone was initiated in tapering doses during 6 days, followed by the introduction of preventive treatment. Withdrawal symptoms and the frequency, intensity and duration of the headache, as well as the consumption of rescue medications, were analysed during the first 16 and 30 days of withdrawal. Eighty-five percent of the patients experienced a reduction in headache frequency and no patients presented severe attacks during the first 6 days. With regard to the following 10 days, 46% of the patients experienced at least 2 days without headache and 58% less intense attacks. Most of the patients noticed attacks with longer duration. After the 30-day period there was a significant decrease in headache frequency (mean 0.83, P<0.001), and no patients returned to overuse of SM. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detoxify patients suffering from rebound headaches, using oral prednisone during the first days of withdrawal, in an out-patient setting.

22870021|t|Therapeutic effect of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment for ocular graft versus host disease and vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
22870021|a|PURPOSE: To determine whether topical tacrolimus might prove effective in the treatment of refractory anterior segment inflammatory diseases, and to evaluate its efficacy in eyes with ocular graft versus host disease (GVHD), and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with anterior segment inflammation refractory to steroid treatment were treated with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea from March 2008 through August 2009. Seven patients had ocular GVHD and seven had VKC. We evaluated the conjunctival and corneal inflammatory change at one, two, four, and eight weeks after treatment with a scoring system. Time to initial response of treatment and therapeutic effect between GVHD and VKC was also analyzed. After the eight-week treatment period, patients were divided into two groups (maintenance group and discontinuance group). Eight patients maintained the treatment for an additional four months, and six patients discontinued the treatments. Therapeutic effect was also compared between the groups at eight weeks and six months after treatment. RESULTS: The mean conjunctival and corneal inflammation score was reduced significantly at eight weeks after treatment (p < 0.0001). The therapeutic effect in conjunctival inflammation was first noted at week two after the initial treatment (p = 0.002); reduction in corneal inflammation was first noted at one week (p = 0.0009). When compared according to diagnosis, no therapeutic difference was detected between the groups (p > 0.05). Six months after treatment, we noted no therapeutic differences between the maintenance group and discontinuance group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 0.03% tacrolimus ointment was safe and effective for use in anterior segment inflammatory disease refractory to steroid.

19746447|t|Runx2-mediated bcl-2 gene expression contributes to nitric oxide protection against hydrogen peroxide-induced osteoblast apoptosis.
19746447|a|Nitric oxide (NO) can regulate osteoblast activities. This study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of pretreatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as a source of NO on hydrogen peroxide-induced osteoblast insults and its possible mechanisms. Exposure of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells to hydrogen peroxide significantly increased cellular oxidative stress, but decreased ALP activity and cell viability, inducing cell apoptosis. Pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP significantly lowered hydrogen peroxide-induced cell insults. Treatment of human MG63 cells with hydrogen peroxide inhibited Bcl-2 mRNA and protein production, but pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP significantly ameliorated such inhibition. Sequentially, hydrogen peroxide decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, but increased the levels of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activity. Pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP significantly lowered such alterations. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide decreased Runx2 mRNA and protein syntheses. However, pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP significantly lowered the suppressive effects. Runx2 knockdown using RNA interference inhibited Bcl-2 mRNA production in human MG63 cells. Protection of pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP against hydrogen peroxide-induced alterations in ALP activity, caspase-3 activity, apoptotic cells, and cell viability were also alleviated after administration of Runx2 small interference RNA. Thus, this study shows that pretreatment with 0.3 mM SNP can protect human MG63 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic insults possibly via Runx2-involved regulation of bcl-2 gene expression.

8689725|a|Eudistomins, isolated from the colonial tunicate Eudistoma olivaceum, have been a synthetic target due to their strong antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and activities against certain types of tumors in vivo. In order to examine the structure-activity relationship of eudistomins, 12-carbaeudistomin analogs were synthesized and their activities against influenza A and B virus, HSV-1, HSV-2 and human cytomegalovirus were investigated. Among them, racemic 6-methoxy-12-carbaeudistomin showed similar activity to (-)-debromoeudistomin K, synthesized as a control compound.

17308269|t|Sequenced compared with simultaneous anthracycline and cyclophosphamide in high-risk stage I and II breast cancer: final analysis from INT-0137 (S9313).
17308269|a|PURPOSE: We conducted a phase III randomized study of two adjuvant treatment schedules of doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in early-stage breast cancer to determine if administration of sequential single agents (A --> C) results in superior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) versus the same total dose given in combination (AC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: High-risk node-negative or low-risk node-positive breast cancer patients received AC given: (arm I) concurrently (AC) doxorubicin 54 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 1.2 g/m2 intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for six cycles; or (arm II) in sequence (A C) doxorubicin 40.5 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 2 every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by cyclophosphamide 2.4 gm/m2 IV every 2 weeks for three cycles. Total dose and duration were identical, but the intensity of each drug was increased on A C. Both arms included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support and prophylactic antibiotics. All but premenopausal women with receptor negative tumors received tamoxifen after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 1997, 3,176 patients were randomly assigned. Arms were well balanced; 48% of eligible patients were node-negative and 48% were estrogen receptor-positive. No significant differences in OS or DFS were observed; 5-year estimates of OS (95% CI) were 88% (87% to 90%) on AC and 89% (87% to 91%) on A --> C. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was greater on A --> C, but nonhematological grade 4 was similar. CONCLUSION: The overall result does not support superiority of dose-intense sequenced single agents. The greater toxicity of higher doses of single agents does not support their sequential use.

15040025|t|Comparison of long-term effects between intra-arterially delivered ethanol and Gelfoam for the treatment of severe arterioportal shunt in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
15040025|a|AIM: To evaluate long-term effect of ethanol embolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with severe hepatic arterioportal shunt (APS), compared with Gelfoam embolization. METHODS: Sixty-four patients (ethanol group) and 33 patients (Gelfoam group) with HCC and APS were respectively treated with ethanol and Gelfoam for APS before the routine interventional treatment for the tumor. Frequency of recanalization of shunt, complete occlusion of the shunt, side effects, complications, and survival rates were analyzed between the two groups. RESULTS: The occlusion rate of APS after initial treatment in ethanol group was 70.3%(45/64), and recanalization rate of 1 month after embolization was 17.8%(8/45), and complete occlusion rate was 82.8%(53/64). Those in Gelfoam group were 63.6%(21/33), 85.7%(18/21), and 18.2%(6/33). There were significant differences in recanalization rate and complete occlusion rate between the two groups (P<0.05). The survival rates in ethanol group were 78% at 6 months, 49% at 12 months, 25% at 24 months, whereas those in Gelfoam group were 58% at 6 months, 23% at 12 months, 15% at 24 months. The ethanol group showed significantly better survival than Gelfoam group (P<0.05). In the ethanol group, there was a significant prolongation of survival in patients with monofocal HCC (P<0.05) and Child class A (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in survival rate in the Gelfoam group with regard to the number of tumor and Child class (P>0.05). The incidence rate of abdominal pain during procedure in ethanol group was 82.8%. There was no significant difference in postembolization syndromes between two groups. Procedure-related hepatic failure did not occur in ethanol group. CONCLUSION: Ethanol embolization for patients with HCC and severe APS is efficacious and safe, and may contribute to prolongation of the life span versus Gelfoam embolization.

15390224|t|Detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions: mangafodipir vs. superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
15390224|a|PURPOSE: To compare the mangafodipir-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced images for their ability to detect and characterize focal hepatic lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unenhanced, mangafodipir-enhanced, and SPIO-enhanced hepatic MR images obtained from 64 patients were analyzed. A total of 121 hepatic lesions were included: 66 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 26 metastases, 14 hemangiomas, 5 cysts, 3 cholangiocarcinomas, 4 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs), 2 abscesses, and 1 adenoma. Two radiologists independently reviewed the two sets of images in a random order: 1) the unenhanced and mangafodipir-enhanced images (the mangafodipir set) and 2) the unenhanced and SPIO-enhanced images (the SPIO set). This study compared the accuracy of lesion detection, the ability to distinguish between a benign and malignant lesion, and the ability to distinguish between the hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular origins of the lesions using the areas (Az) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The overall accuracy for detecting focal lesions was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with the SPIO set (Az = 0.846 and 0.871 for readers 1 and 2, respectively) than with the mangafodipir set (Az = 0.716 and 0.766). Most of the lesions detected only with the SPIO-enhanced MR images by the readers were small HCCs. For lesions larger than 15 mm, the sensitivities of the two contrast enhancement techniques were similar for both readers. The accuracy of the mangafodipir and SPIO sets in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions was comparable. The accuracy for distinguishing between the hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular origins of the lesions was significantly higher (P < 0.05) using the mangafodipir set (Az = 0.897 and 0.946) than using the SPIO set (Az = 0.741 and 0.833). CONCLUSION: SPIO- and mangafodipir-enhanced images were comparable for detection of focal hepatic lesions other than small HCCs, which were better detected on the SPIO-enhanced images. Mangafodipir-enhanced images are likely better than the SPIO-enhanced images for distinguishing between focal liver lesions with a hepatocellular or nonhepatocellular origin.

12363473|t|Relationships of in vitro sensitivities tested with nine drugs and two types of irradiation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
12363473|a|Extensive research into mechanisms of cytotoxic drug and irradiation resistance have produced few clinically encouraging results. In this report, we apply correlation analyses to drug and irradiation response results from a cohort of 36 classical B chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL) patients. Nine drugs and two types of irradiation were selected according to their usefulness in CLL therapy or on the basis of their otherwise interesting mechanisms of action. Part of the results concerning individual drugs have been previously published, but new correlation analyses are presented in this paper. Altogether 2376 duplicate cultures were performed in order to determine ID(80) values, i.e. doses causing an 80% inhibition in 4-day cultures when leucine incorporation was used as an indicator of cells vitality. Non-parametric Spearman's rank order correlation confirmed a tight relationship between 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and fludarabine, as expected. Surprisingly, correlation between two P-glycoprotein-dependent drugs, vincristine and doxorubicin, was not demonstrable. A number of entirely unexpected correlations were identified between drugs with very different mechanisms of action: (i) chlorambucil and gamma-irradiation; (ii) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and vincristine; (iii) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and gamma-irradiation; (iv) fludarabine and cis-platin; (v) doxorubicine and gamma-irradiation; (vi) prednisolone and cyclosporin A; (vii) vincristine and verapamil. Our findings emphasize: (i) the usefulness of fresh tumor cells instead of cell lines in cytotoxicity studies; (ii) the great variation in cytotoxicity in individual patients, i.e. tumor cell heterogeneity, as well as patient heterogeneity; and (iii) an entirely unexpected finding that there were tight relationships in drug and irradiation responses between substances supposed to act with very different mechanisms.

18327480|t|Comparison between E-test and CLSI broth microdilution method for antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida albicans oral isolates.
18327480|a|Thirty Candida albicans isolated from oral candidosis patients and 30 C. albicans isolated from control individuals were studied. In vitro susceptibility tests were performed for amphotericin B, fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and itraconazole through the Clinical and Laboratorial Standards Institute (CLSI) reference method and E test system. The results obtained were analyzed and compared. MIC values were similar for the strains isolated from oral candidosis patients and control individuals. The agreement rate for the two methods was 66.67% for amphotericin B, 53.33% for fluconazole, 65% for flucytosine and 45% for itraconazole. According to our data, E test method could be an alternative to trial routine susceptibility testing due to its simplicity. However, it can not be considered a substitute for the CLSI reference method.

15051213|t|Sequential changes of lipid tear film after the instillation of a single drop of a new emulsion eye drop in dry eye patients.
15051213|a|PURPOSE: The lipid tear film stabilizes the tears by lowering the surface tension and preventing aqueous tear evaporation and may be analyzed by kinetic analysis of the tear interference images. This study investigated changes in the lipid film after application of a new emulsion-based eye drop of Refresh Endura (Allergan, Irvine, CA) in normal subjects and patients with dry eyes. DESIGN: Comparative, nonrandomized interventional study. PARTICIPANTS: Five normal subjects and 10 aqueous tear deficiency (ATD) patients with or without lipid tear deficiency were enrolled prospectively. METHODS: A complete eye examination was performed, including symptom score, tear break-up time, dye staining, and fluorescein clearance test. One eye received a single dose of emulsion eye drop (EED), whereas the other eye received nonpreserved saline as a control. Kinetic analysis of tear interference images taken by DR-1 (Kowa, Japan) was performed before and at various times after instillation of the drops. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms, pattern, thickness, and spread time of the tear film. RESULTS: Compared with the control, all eyes receiving EED showed rapid restructuring of the preexisting lipid film. In normal persons, restructuring resulted in a thick lipid band across the cornea and a significant increase of the lipid film thickness. For ATD patients, EED application resulted in either a scant, irregular tear film, which became covered by the lipid film, or a modified lipid film changed without forming a band or irregularities. Emulsion eye drops tended to be more comfortable in patients with more severe ATD. Kinetic analysis showed that the mean spread time improved for all patients after EED when compared with baseline or with controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Emulsion eye drop produces significant changes in the tear film of normal and dry eye patients. Further investigation with a prolonged period of treatment is warranted to establish whether EED may help improve the spread and thickness of the lipid tear film in moderate and severe dry eyes.

24635821|t|Chylous ascites after a living-donor liver graft, effectively treated in a child with octreotide.
24635821|a|Chylous ascites after a liver transplant is a rare complication of surgery. We report a 11-month-old girl with biliary atresia who was presented with chylous ascites after a liver transplant. On the seventh day after surgery, while being fed, chylous ascites was observed. Besides fasting and diuretics, total parenteral nutrition and somatostatin analogue (octreotide) were initiated. Chylous ascites resolved in 3 weeks. Abdominal distention recurred 1 week later; fasting and total parenteral nutrition, combined with octreotide, were administered again for 2 more weeks. Thereafter, enteral feeding was started without any complications.

15525445|t|A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of desmopressin: evaluating sex differences and the effect of pre-treatment with piroxicam, and further validation of an indirect response model.
15525445|a|Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue mainly used in treatment of diabetes insipidus and nocturia. Studies in rats have revealed a sex difference in the response to a vasopressin infusion, which was diminished after treatment with an NSAID. This study was performed in man to investigate the influence of sex and concomitant treatment of piroxicam on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of desmopressin, and to validate a previously described indirect response model. Eight healthy males and eight healthy females participated in the trial, which was conducted in a pharmacokinetic (PK) part followed by a pharmacodynamic (PD) part. Desmopressin was administered intravenously as a single dose (PK = dose 2 microg, PD = dose 0.2 microg). Piroxicam was administered to achieve steady state. The pharmacokinetic parameters of desmopressin were estimated and calculated by means of two-compartmental analysis. In the dynamic part a study design based on an oral hydration model was used. Parameters for urine flow and urine osmolality were estimated. Individual estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters served as input to the indirect response model that subsequently was fitted to urine osmolality data. The pharmacokinetics of desmopressin after a fixed bolus injection was neither influenced by piroxicam nor sex of the subject. The pharmacodynamics of desmopressin showed a sex difference where females exhibited a more pronounced antidiuretic effect than males, which was statistically significant when the effects were submaximal (>4.5 h after dose). The sex differences were diminished after pre-treatment with piroxicam, indicating a prostaglandin PGE(2)-mediated mechanism. The indirect response model was confirmed, although the modelling could not distinguish a sex difference, indicating a limitation of this model compared with traditional descriptive statistics.

1687447|t|Hypertension in African Americans: evaluation and treatment issues.
1687447|a|The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage. The cost of early intervention is minimal compared with the economic consequences of neglect.

16674304|t|Bone-like tissue formation by three-dimensional culture of MG63 osteosarcoma cells in gelatin hydrogels using calcium-enriched medium.
16674304|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ca(2+) concentration in culture medium on the promotion of osteogenesis by MG63 osteoblast-like cells and to prepare bone-like tissues by supplying Ca(2+)-enriched medium to MG63 cells immobilized in three-dimensional gelatin hydrogels. Human osteosarcoma MG63 cells were cultured on tissue culture dish under various Ca(2+) concentrations to evaluate the effect of Ca(2+) concentration on calcium deposition. When Ca(2+) concentration was 8 mM, the maximum calcium deposition was obtained at day 28. Then MG63 cells were entrapped in gelatin hydrogels cross-linked by transglutaminase and cultured for 28 days, either in a standard culture medium or in medium containing 8 mM Ca(2+). Effects of Ca(2+)-enriched medium on osteoblastic phenotype of MG63 cells in gelatin hydrogels were analyzed in terms of cell number, calcium deposition content, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The characteristics of calcified gelatin hydrogels were evaluated by x-ray diffraction (XRD), histological analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After 28 days of culture, no significant difference in cell numbers was found between the different culture conditions. However, calcium content of gelatin hydrogels with cells cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media was significantly higher than that of hydrogels with cells cultured in standard Ca(2+) concentration medium. After 14 days of culture, ALP activity of cells cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media was down-regulated compared with that of cells cultured in standard Ca(2+) concentration media. XRD analysis indicated the formation of hydroxyapatite in gelatin hydrogels cultured in the Ca(2+)-enriched media at day 14, and the XRD pattern of the composite at day 21 was almost similar to that of mouse tibia. Moreover, histological analysis and SEM analysis revealed that cross-sections of hydrogels cultured in Ca(2+)-enriched media had an organic/mineral layer structure analogous to that of mouse tibia.

20106720|t|Neoadjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin before chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision in MRI-defined poor-risk rectal cancer: a phase 2 trial.
20106720|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with poor-risk rectal cancer defined by MRI can be at high risk of disease recurrence despite standard chemoradiotherapy and optimum surgery. We aimed to assess the safety and long-term efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin before chemoradiotherapy and total mesorectal excision, a treatment strategy developed to enhance the outcome of this population. METHODS: Between November, 2001, and August, 2005, we enrolled eligible patients with poor-risk rectal cancer defined by high-resolution MRI and without metastatic disease. The protocol was amended in January, 2004, following clinically significant cardiotoxic events (nine events in eight of 77 patients), to exclude patients with a recent history of clinically significant cardiac problems. Patients received 12 weeks of neoadjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks) followed by chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy over 6 weeks) with capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice daily), total mesorectal excision, and 12 weeks of postoperative adjuvant capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response rate. We followed up patients for a median of 55 months (IQR 47-67). Efficacy analyses were undertaken for the intention-to-treat population, unless otherwise specified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00220051. FINDINGS: 105 eligible patients were enrolled. Radiological response rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were 74% (78/105) and 89% (93/105), respectively. 97 patients underwent surgery, of whom 95 underwent total mesorectal excision, of whom 93 had microscopically clear resection margins and 21 had pathological complete response (21/105 [20%]). 3-year progression-free and overall survival were 68% (95% CI 59-77) and 83% (76-91), respectively. 3-year relapse-free survival for patients who had complete resection was 74% (65-83). Following the protocol amendment for cardiovascular safety, only one further thromboembolic event was reported (fatal pulmonary embolism). INTERPRETATION: Intensification of systemic therapy with neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy before standard treatment is feasible in poor-risk potentially operable rectal cancer, with acceptable safety and promising long-term outcomes. Future development of this multidisciplinary treatment strategy in randomised trials is warranted. FUNDING: UK National Health Service, Sanofi-Aventis.

12153896|t|Transport refusal by hypoglycemic patients after on-scene intravenous dextrose.
12153896|a|OBJECTIVES: Administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose to hypoglycemic patients is delegated to advanced care paramedics in Ontario. Following a quality assurance review, which revealed that 47% of patients refused transport after receiving IV dextrose, the authors studied whether such patients seek additional medical care in the three days following the initial refusal. METHODS: Sequential ambulance call reports for on-scene treatments of hypoglycemia were examined, and a standardized telephone survey of the patients was conducted. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. Data were collected from April 1999 to March 2000. RESULTS: One hundred patients were studied, with ages ranging from 20 to 92 years (mean 53.2 years). The average Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on presentation was 8.7 +/- 3.5. The average blood glucose level before administration of IV dextrose was 1.91 +/- 0.63 mmol/L. Sixty-eight percent of the patients refused transport. Significant differences between the transported group and the refusal group were age (transported 64.7 years, refused 47.8 years, p = 0.002) and initial blood glucose (transported 1.8, refused 2.1, p = 0.001). No difference was found in terms of repeat access to health care for related complaints. Patient satisfaction was high in both groups, with no difference in the overall satisfaction with paramedics' care (4.76 +/- 0.58 vs 4.75 +/- 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: The practice of treating patients for symptomatic hypoglycemia and leaving them at the scene appears to be safe. Further study is required to confirm this.

22399368|t|Metformin use among individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes.
22399368|a|Excess total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain very high among those with type 2 diabetes versus those without diabetes. Clinical trials to lower blood glucose have been disappointing probably because the participants were too late in the natural history of diabetes and already had extensive vascular disease. Insulin resistance measured simply by elevated fasting blood insulin is an early marker of b-cell stress and peripheral insulin resistance. Metformin will prevent development of diabetes among patients with impaired fasting glucose but only for the short term. Metformin reduces risk of coronary heart disease. The drug is safe, low cost, and may also prevent cancer. The combination of diet and exercise followed by metformin in the early phase of "insulin resistance" may reduce or delay both atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis complications associated with diabetes. Preventive therapy must begin much earlier than before clinical diagnosis of diabetes and aim to initially lower blood insulin levels or insulin resistance.

17980183|t|Metaanalysis of the effect of antenatal indomethacin on neonatal outcomes.
17980183|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether indomethacin used as a tocolytic agent is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We used published guidelines of the Metaanalysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Group (MOOSE) to perform the metaanalysis. The search strategy used included computerized bibliographic searches of MEDLINE (1966-2005), PubMed (1966-2005), abstracts published in Obstetrics and Gynecology (1991-2005), abstracts published in Pediatric Research (1991-2005), and references of published manuscripts. Study inclusion criteria were publication in English, more than 30 deliveries less than 37 weeks' gestation, and meeting diagnostic criteria for individual neonatal outcomes. Exclusion criteria included case reports, case series, and multiple publications from the same author. Metaanalysis was performed using random effects model if there were more than 2 observational studies for a specific outcome. Eggers test was performed to exclude publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of antenatal steroid exposure, gestation, and recent antenatal indomethacin exposure (duration of 48 hours or more between the last dose and delivery). RESULTS: Fifteen retrospective cohort studies and 6 case-controlled studies met inclusion criteria. Antenatal indomethacin was associated with an increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.1). Recent exposure to antenatal indomethacin was associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (OR, 2.2; 95% CI; 1.1-4.2). Antenatal indomethacin was not associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and mortality. CONCLUSION: Antenatal indomethacin may be associated with an increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants and therefore should be used judiciously for tocolysis.

16984593|t|Endoscopic therapy for bleeding esophageal varices improves the outcome of Child C cirrhotic patients.
16984593|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Bleeding from esophageal varices is one of the frequent severe complications arising in patients with liver cirrhosis. The management of esophageal varices is therefore important for patient survival. The purpose of this study was to clarify the predictive factors for mortality in patients with Child C cirrhosis presenting with variceal bleeding. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 77 Child C cirrhotic patients with bleeding from esophageal varices was conducted. All patients received endoscopic therapy. Twenty-nine patients received endoscopic variceal ligation, and 48 patients received endoscopic injection sclerotherapy or endoscopic injection sclerotherapy with ligation. Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical data were performed to identify the prognostic factors for survival for these 77 patients. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 77 patients received endoscopic therapy within 24 h after variceal bleeding, and bleeding was controlled in 55 (96.5%). The remaining 20 patients received endoscopic therapy more than 24 h after bleeding. Higher bilirubin level and rebleeding were the predictive parameters for 6-week survival in the 77 patients, according to univariate and multivariate analysis. Higher bilirubin level, refractory ascites, and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma were the predictive parameters for mortality in 77 patients as determined by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy was effective in controlling acute variceal bleeding of Child C cirrhotic patients. The prognosis of Child C stage patients presenting with variceal bleeding depended on the severity of liver damage and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

7776110|t|Double-blind, randomized trial of one versus three prophylactic doses of synthetic surfactant in 826 neonates weighing 700 to 1100 grams: effects on mortality rate. American Exosurf Neonatal Study Groups I and IIa.
7776110|a|At 33 hospitals in the United States, a double-blind, randomized clinical trial was performed to compare one versus three prophylactic doses of synthetic surfactant in 700 to 1100 gm inborn infants. All 826 infants received an initial prophylactic dose of surfactant within 30 minutes of birth. Subsequently 410 infants received two doses of placebo (air) 12 and 24 hours later, and 416 infants received two additional doses of surfactant. By the age of 28 days, 70 infants who received one dose of surfactant and 40 infants who received three doses were dead, a 43% relative reduction in the mortality rate (30 fewer deaths; p = 0.002). By the age of 1 year after term, 87 infants who received one dose and 62 infants who received three doses were dead: a 29% relative reduction in the mortality rate (25 fewer deaths; p = 0.027). Infants who received three doses of surfactant required significantly less oxygen and less mean airway pressure for the first week of life. Necrotizing enterocolitis (9 vs 25 infants; p = 0.005), and use of high-frequency ventilation (13 vs 26 infants; p = 0.037); pancuronium (43 vs 62 infants; p = 0.045); and leukocyte transfusions (0 vs 4 infants; p = 0.042) were less frequent in the three-dose group, but air leak, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, and infections were not different. These results indicate that physiologic findings, mortality rates, and probably morbidity rates are improved by two additional prophylactic doses of synthetic surfactant.

22672269|t|Heparin affin regulatory peptide modulates the endogenous anticoagulant activity of heparin and heparan sulphate mimetics.
22672269|a|Pleiotrophin, also known as heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP), is a growth factor expressed in various tissues and cell lines. In this work, HARP was tested for its capacity to modulate the anticoagulant activity of heparin and heparan sulphate mimetics (OTR4120). We used both in vitro and in vivo assays. HARP was found to be differently effective for neutralization of the anticoagulant activity of the mimetic heparan sulphate (OTR4120) and heparin in purified system and human plasma. HARP was shown to compete with both antithrombin and thrombin for binding to heparin and to OTR4120, respectively. In the presence of OTR4120, the V(max) was constant and the calculated maximum velocity was 1.56  U/min; the thrombin Km value (0.011  nM) was affected by HARP concentrations. The Km (HARP) value was 0.085  nM, which is consistent with high affinity of HARP to OTR4120. Under the same conditions, initial velocity patterns for antithrombin-heparin were determined in the presence or in the absence of HARP. The antithrombin value Km (0.022  nM) was affected by HARP (0.077  nM). HARP exhibits efficacy equivalent to or greater than protamine. Interestingly, intraperitoneally administered HARP decreased the anticoagulant activity of heparin and of OTR4120 in mice. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence for a physiological role of HARP in the modulation of anticoagulant activity of heparin and heparin-like material.

12843025|t|Genetic relationship between methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains from France and from international sources: delineation of genomic groups.
12843025|a|Cluster analysis of the SmaI patterns, generated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, of 44 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and 118 methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated in various French hospitals and 61 MRSA and 48 MSSA strains from 20 other countries revealed 20 genomic groups distributed into four distantly related phylogenic branches. Eighty-three of the 105 MRSA strains (79%) were clustered in the six genomic groups of phylogenic branch I; and 154 of the 166 MSSA strains (92.8%) were clustered in the 14 genomic groups of phylogenic branches II, III, and IV. Agreement between genomic group and two other markers, esterase type and phage group, was obtained, emphasizing the clonal structure of the population. The genomic groups were delineated by esterase type. The distribution of the strains within the genomic groups was independent of their geographical origin; French strains were clustered with strains from other countries. The three types of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) complex were distributed according to genomic groups. Most of the time, type I and type II SCCmec complexes were found in the MRSA strains belonging to the same genomic groups. In contrast, the type III SCCmec complex was specific to the MRSA strains belonging to the three genomic groups characterized by a common esterase type.

17639394|t|Cisplatin-DNA adduct formation in patients treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiation: lack of correlation between normal tissues and primary tumor.
17639394|a|PURPOSE: In this study, the formation of cisplatin-DNA adducts after concurrent cisplatin-radiation and the relationship between adduct-formation in primary tumor tissue and normal tissue were investigated. METHODS: Three intravenous cisplatin-regimens, given concurrently with radiation, were studied: daily low-dose (6 mg/m(2)) cisplatin, weekly 40 mg/m(2), three-weekly 100 mg/m(2). A (32)P-postlabeling technique was used to quantify adducts in normal tissue [white blood cells (WBC) and buccal cells] and tumor. RESULTS: Normal tissue samples for adduct determination were obtained from 63 patients and tumor biopsies from 23 of these patients. Linear relationships and high correlations were observed between the levels of two guanosine- and adenosine-guanosine-adducts in normal and tumor tissue. Adduct levels in tumors were two to five times higher than those in WBC (P<0.001). No significant correlations were found between adduct levels in normal tissues and primary tumor biopsies, nor between WBC and buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: In concurrent chemoradiotherapy schedules, cisplatin adduct levels in tumors were significantly higher than in normal tissues (WBC). No evidence of a correlation was found between adduct levels in normal tissues and primary tumor biopsies. This lack of correlation may, to some extent, explain the inconsistencies in the literature regarding whether or not cisplatin-DNA adducts can be used as a predictive test in anticancer platinum therapy.

20471765|t|Escherichia coli resistance to quinolones at a comprehensive cancer center.
20471765|a|As part of Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection/USA Surveillance Programme, we monitored the occurrence of quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli over a 10-year period. A total of 271 E. coli isolates from our institution were tested over a 10-year period. Screening for quinolone resistance (qnr) gene was performed. A decline in susceptibility of E. coli isolates to quinolones and aminoglycosides was noted over the 10-year span (P < 0.0001), which was significantly reduced compared with the average susceptibility of all sites. Introduction of quinolone prophylaxis has led to a significant decline in susceptibility of E. coli to all quinolones. The organisms remain susceptible to carbapenems, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Periodic surveillance allows for detection of resistance patterns and adjustment of empiric antibiotic choice in patients at high risk for infection.

19248869|t|Increased sweetened beverage intake is associated with reduced milk and calcium intake in 3- to 7-year-old children at multi-item laboratory lunches.
19248869|a|Dietary survey data show that intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is negatively associated with intake of milk, but these findings have yet to be confirmed by laboratory feeding studies. The objectives of the present study were to analyze children's intake across two laboratory-based ad libitum lunches to (a) investigate the relationships between intake of sweetened beverages, milk, and calcium, and (b) explore relationships between beverage consumption and child age and weight status. Data were extracted from a cohort of 126 3- to 7-year-old twins from diverse ethnic backgrounds who participated in a cross-sectional study (conducted from November 1999 to September 2002) designed to determine the genetic and environmental contributions to eating and body weight. At two visits, children ate ad libitum from lunches that offered a variety of sugar-sweetened and calcium-rich beverages. Total beverage and nutrient intakes were computed from the test meals. Weight, height, and waist circumference were assessed on the final visit. Regression analyses tested the associations among intake of sweetened beverages, calcium, and milk (primary aim), and whether these variables were associated with child age and weight status (secondary aim). Sweetened beverage intake was negatively correlated with both milk (P<0.01) and calcium (P<0.01) intakes, and these relationships remained after controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity (P<0.01). Child age was negatively associated with milk intake (r=-0.22, P<0.01) but positively associated with intake of sweetened beverages (r=0.27, P<0.01). Results support the notion that sugar-sweetened beverages displace milk in a single meal, and this phenomenon may vary with child age. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, future investigations are needed to determine the long-term implications of this consumption pattern. The possibility that limiting sweetened beverages may help optimize dietary calcium during childhood is a topic that merits further research.

21545203|t|Oleanolic acid from Prunella Vulgaris L. induces SPC-A-1 cell line apoptosis via regulation of Bax, Bad and Bcl-2 expression.
21545203|a|Prunella vulgaris L. (PV) has been used as a herb for chemoprevention of lung cancer. In this study, the main active compound, oleanolic acid (OA) was isolated from an ethanol extract and its chemical structure was identified according to the results of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrography (LC-MS). Results for cell viability indictated no notable differences between OA and ethanol extract of PV in lung adenocarcinoma SPC-A-1 cells measured by MTT assay. Consistent concentration-response curves. Fluorescence detection with acridine orange-ethidium bromide was used to evaluate apoptosis of SPC-A-1 cells. OA at 16 and 8 microM group increased significantly the apoptosis rate compared with normal and 1% DMSO groups (p<0.05). In addition, immunocytochemistry assays showed increase in Bax and Bad protein expression while Bcl-2 decreased. Moreover, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was heightened by OA treatment. The results suggest OA induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells through down-regulating Bcl-2 expression, and up-regulating Bax and Bad expression.

7741285|t|Wheezing during induction of general anesthesia in patients with and without asthma. A randomized, blinded trial.
7741285|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma who require general anesthesia and tracheal intubation are at increased risk for the development of bronchospasm during induction. The incidence of wheezing during induction with different intravenously administered agents is unknown. A randomized, double-blinded prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of wheezing in asymptomatic asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients receiving three commonly used intravenous anesthetic agents for induction of anesthesia. METHODS: Fifty-nine asymptomatic asthmatic and 96 nonasthmatic patients of ASA physical status 1 and 2 were studied. All patients received 1.5 micrograms/kg fentanyl, oxygen, followed by either 5 mg/kg thiopental or thiamylal, 1.75 mg/kg methohexital or 2.5 mg/kg propofol, 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine, tracheal intubation, and inhalational anesthesia. Wheezing was assessed by an independent blinded observer, auscultating the lungs at 2 and 5 min postintubation. Data were analyzed by Pearson's chi-squared, Fisher's exact test, and multiple logistic regression with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Both asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients who received a thiobarbiturate for induction had a greater incidence of wheezing than did patients receiving propofol. In asthmatic patients, 45% (23, 67) (mean and 95% confidence interval) who received a thiobarbiturate, 26% (8, 44) who received an oxybarbiturate, and none (0, 17) who received propofol wheezed after intubation. In nonasthmatic patients, 16% (3, 28) who received thiobarbiturate and 3% (0, 9) who received propofol wheezed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that propofol should be considered for induction of anesthesia in patients, particularly those with asthma, who require timely intubation.

23591640|t|Okadaic acid activates the PKR pathway and induces apoptosis through PKR stimulation in MG63 osteoblast-like cells.
23591640|a|Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is one of the players in the cellular antiviral responses and is involved in transcriptional stimulation through activation of NF-kB. Treatment of the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid stimulated the expression and phosphorylation of IkBa, as judged from the results of real-time PCR and western blot analysis. We investigated the functional relationship between PKR and signal transduction of NF-kB by establishing PKR-K/R cells that produced a catalytically inactive mutant of PKR. Phosphorylation of eIF-2a, a substrate of PKR, was not stimulated by okadaic acid in the PKR-K/R cells, whereas okadaic acid induced phosphorylation of eIF-2a in MG63 cells. Phosphorylation of NF-kB in MG63 cells was stimulated by okadaic acid; however, okadaic acid did not induce phosphorylation of NF-kB in the PKR-K/R cells. Finally, okadaic acid-induced apoptosis was inhibited in the PKR-K/R cells. Our results suggest that okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of IkBa was mediated by PKR kinase activity, thus, indicating the involvement of this kinase in the control mechanism governing the activation of NF-kB and induction of apoptosis.

21478916|t|Feasibility of hypomethylating agents followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
21478916|a|The role of hypomethylating agent therapy (HMT) as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains undetermined. We investigated the feasibility of HMT followed by alloHCT in patients with MDS. In all, 19 patients who received HMT followed by alloHCT were analyzed. A total of 7 patients were classified as low-risk and 12 as high-risk, based on World Health Organization (WHO) classification at the time of HMT. HMT consisted of decitabine in 9 patients and azacitidine in 10. After HMT, two patients achieved CR, six mCR, three hematologic improvement alone, and six SD in terms of best response. HMT did not alter WHO classification in 15 patients (79%), whereas 1 patient (5%) improved and 3 (16%) progressed to AML. Most patients (95%) received a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen based on fludarabine/BU/anti-thymocyte globulin, and peripheral blood-mobilized stem cells. Neutrophil and platelet engraftments were achieved in 95 and 79% of patients, respectively. The incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were 42 and 26%, respectively. In all, 2-year OS rates were 68%, and the overall outcomes of those who achieved CR/mCR with HMT tended to be superior to those without CR/mCR. HMT followed by alloHCT was a feasible and effective treatment strategy for patients with MDS.

16999712|t|Health behaviors in breast cancer survivors experiencing bone loss.
16999712|a|PURPOSE: To describe the baseline healthy lifestyle behaviors (dietary, calcium, vitamin D, caffeine and alcohol intake, smoking history, and physical activity) of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS); and to identify any relationship of healthy lifestyle behaviors with bone mineral density (BMD) at the forearm, total hip and spine, L1-L4. DATA SOURCES: Self-reported responses to a demographic and health status questionnaire, to a 3-day Diet Record, and to the 7-Day Physical Activity Questionnaire-Adapted provided data for the lifestyle behaviors. Baseline BMD (g/cm(2)) was determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were also measured in each of the 249 postmenopausal BCS. CONCLUSIONS: There was an imbalance between consumed kilocalories and expenditure of energy. The majority of BCS were overweight or obese. They consumed less fruit and vegetable servings than recommended by the new 2005 U.S. Department of Agriculture's dietary guidelines, less dairy products, below average recommended grains and fiber, less protein and carbohydrate intake, and a slightly higher fat gram intake. Approximately, 43% did not take any supplemental calcium, with 46% taking less than 1000 mg a day. Likewise, 52.59% consumed less than 400 IU of vitamin D with both supplemental and dietary intake. This group of BCS consumed below accepted levels of caffeine and alcohol. Only 18 BCS continued to smoke. This group spent an average of 10.36 h in light (sedentary) activities on a daily basis. There were significant negative relationships with bone mass (g/cm(2)) at the total hip and daily intake of caffeine/mg and daily grams of alcohol. Weight and BMI both demonstrated a significant relationship with bone mass (g/cm(2)) at the total hip, spine L1-L4, and the forearm. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The healthcare provider must incorporate appropriate teaching strategies, intensive counseling, and coaching, along with a support mechanism, to enable BCS to understand the importance of a healthy diet, calcium, and vitamin D supplement, and a regular strength/weight program that will be integrated into their daily lifestyle. Early DEXA screens should be part of the protocol with BCS, and there is a particular need for forearm DEXA screens to be included in the treatment protocol for BCS.

20091939|t|Growth and thyroid function in children with in utero exposure to dioxin: a 5-year follow-up study.
20091939|a|Because placental polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins,dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) levels are associated with decreased free thyroxine (FT(4)) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in neonates, we assessed development by gender and maternal PCDD/Fs exposure at years 2 and 5 in 92 mother and newborn pairs. RIA quantified thyroid, sex, and growth hormones. Of 200 subjects followed up from November 2000, 136 and 149 were observed at year 2 and year 5,respectively. PCDD/Fs exposure levels were low (n = 35) or high (n = 35) in 70 subjects at year 2, low (n = 21) or high (n = 20) in 41 at year 5. Height, weight, BMI, and head circumference were significantly higher in males, chest girth significantly higher in females at year 2. Significantly, more girls had higher bone age (BA) and chronological age (CA) at both times. Height, weight, FT(4) x TSH, and transthyretin(TTR) at year 2; and height, triiodothyronine, and IGF-1 at year 5 differed significantly by PCDD/Fs level. In females, height, weight, CA,BA, and thyroid hormones differed significantly at year 2. In males, FT(4) x TSH at year 2 and IGF-1 at year 5 were significantly higher in the high PCDD/Fs group. In utero exposure to PCDD/Fs differentially affects growth and hormone levels in male and female preschool children.

Twenty-two patients with total wart areas of 5-447 mm2 were treated with up to 2 cycles of < or =6 treatments of 5-FU/epi gel. After the first cycle of treatments, patients with warts showing a partial response or no response or new warts were continued into a second cycle. Seventy-three per cent (16/22) of patients had complete responses. Patients with total wart areas < or = 100 mm2 tended to respond completely in the first cycle of treatment (average 4.7 treatments). Patients with numerous warts or large total wart areas (>100 mm2) required an average of 7.5 treatments to achieve a complete response. Thus, a second treatment cycle may be appropriate for difficult-to-treat patients with numerous warts or large total wart areas.

10498175|t|Rapid respiratory deterioration and sudden death due to disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
10498175|a|We report the case of a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) whose death occurred within 30 hours of hospitalization due to disseminated cryptococcosis, manifested by dizziness, cough, and shortness of breath. The clinical picture was consistent with pneumocystis pneumonia, and antibiotic therapy with corticosteroids was initiated. Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition quickly worsened, resulting in cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Autopsy revealed cryptococci in several organs. Sudden, rapid deterioration and death are rare consequences of disseminated cryptococcosis, and steroids may worsen the course of the disease. On the basis of this case and review of similar cases in the literature, we recommend early consideration of disseminated cryptococcosis in AIDS patients with pneumonia. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

16291412|t|Comparison of the effects of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% and olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solutions in seasonal allergic conjunctivities: a 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute-controlled trial.
16291412|a|BACKGROUND: Topical antiallergic agents, such as antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers, are the main therapeutic options for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). Ketotifen fumarate and olopatadine HCl have dual action that offers a combination of these 2 mechanisms. Although clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these 2 drugs have shown that both were effective in the treatment of SAC, the results were contradictory and did not include the effects of these drugs on inflammatory markers. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare the clinical efficacy of topical ketotifen and olopatadine eye drops and to determine the effects of these 2 drugs on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells in patients with SAC. METHODS: This 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute (ATS)-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Karadeniz Technical University, School of Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey. Patients with SAC were included in the study and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: topical ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution, topical olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solution, or ATS (control group). All drugs were administered 2 drops per eye BID for 30 days. At the beginning of the study (day 0; baseline), on day 15, and on day 30, clinical scores (itching, tearing, redness, eyelid, swelling, and chemosis) and conjunctival impression cytology specimens were obtained. The percentages of cells expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular CAM-1, human leukocyte antigen-DR, and beta1-integrin (CD29) from conjunctival impression cytology specimens were determined using flow cytometry. Patients were questioned about adverse events (AEs) at each visit. Ocular discomfort on installation of the drugs was recorded as an AE. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (20 men, 19 women; age range, 18-61 years) with SAC were included. Twelve patients received ketotifen; 13, olopatadine; and 14, ATS. In both active-treatment groups, the improvements of clinical scores (tearing and itching) were more pronounced compared with those in the ATS group, although the day-30 difference in tearing score between the olopatadine and ATS groups was not statistically significant. No significant within-group or between-group differences in mean scores for redness, chemosis, or eyelid swelling were found. The expression rates of CAMs and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells were significantly more reduced with ketotifen and olopatadine compared with ATS. However, clinical and flow cytometric parameters were improved with ATS at 15 and 30 days compared with baseline. No AEs were observed during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study in a selected, small study population with SAC, ketotifen and olopatadine diminished the expression of CAMs and inflammatory markers on the conjunctival surface cells effectively. Both active treatments were more efficacious compared with ATS and were well tolerated.

21235460|t|Novel agents for the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation: focus on vernakalant.
21235460|a|Vernakalant is a novel anti-arrhythmic drug, recently approved for the cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation. Its action is mainly due to the blockade of atrial-selective channels responsible of the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier current I(Kur), but has also important interactions with other channels and currents, such as I(Na) (inward sodium current), and I(KACh) (acetylcholine-regulated potassium current). Due to the relatively selective blockade of the I(Kur), vernakalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the atria with minimal effects on the ventricles, thus minimizing the risk of proarrhythmia. Thus far vernakalant has been tested in three placebo-controlled trials (ACT I, ACT II and ACT III) and in one amiodarone-controlled study (AVRO). Vernakalant has been demonstrated more effective than both placebo and amiodarone for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation, without significant adverse events. This article will review the recent patents on this novel atrial-selective agent, discussing its mechanisms of action and possible clinical applications in the real-world practice.

2226675|t|Smoking, calcium, calcium antagonists, and aging.
2226675|a|Aging is characterized, besides other changes, by a progressive increase in calcium content in the arterial wall, which is enhanced by diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, arterial hypertension, and tabagism. As to tabagism, experiments in animals have shown that nicotine can increase calcium content of the arterial wall, and clinical studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking induces peripheral vasoconstriction, with consequent increase in blood pressure levels. In order to study the role of calcium ions in the pathogenesis of the vasoconstrictive lesions caused by "acute" smoking, the author has studied the peripheral vascular effects of the calcium-channel antagonist nifedipine, a dihydropyridine derivative, and calcitonin, a hypocalcemizing hormone which possess vasoactive actions on 12 elderly regular smokers (mean age 65.8 years). The results demonstrated that both nifedipine (10 mg sublingually 20 min before smoking) and salmon calcitonin (100 MRC U/daily intramuscularly for three days) are able to prevent peripheral vasoconstriction evaluated by Doppler velocimetry, as well as the increase of blood pressure induced by smoking. On the basis of our results, the author proposes that cigarette smoking-induced vasoconstriction is a calcium-mediated process, which can be hindered by drugs with calcium antagonist action.

18166095|t|Regeneration of degree ii furcation defects with a 4% doxycycline hyclate bioabsorbable barrier.
18166095|a|BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of a healing regenerative site has been shown to affect the response to therapy adversely. Doxycycline possesses antibacterial properties as well as other biologic actions that may result in an increased production and maintenance of collagen and bone. The purpose of this study was to assess if the sustained release of 4% doxycycline through a bioabsorbable barrier would enhance the regenerative outcomes of healing furcation sites. METHODS: Individuals with a single degree II furcation defect in a mandibular molar participated. They were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups: poly(DL-lactide) polylactic acid (PLA) barrier containing 4% doxycycline hyclate + demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) (BG+PDox); poly(DL-lactide) PLA barrier without doxycycline + DFDBA (BG+P); or DFDBA alone (BG). Clinical parameters included vertical probing depth (VPD), vertical clinical attachment level (VCAL), gingival recession, and horizontal probing depth (HPD). Intrasurgical measurements to calculate vertical and horizontal furcation fill were obtained at the time of surgery (baseline) and during a reentry procedure 9 months later. Statistical tests were used to assess changes in the clinical and surgical parameters before and after treatment among groups and within each group. RESULTS: Mean changes at 9 months for all groups yielded VPD reductions and VCAL gains. However, no significant difference was noted for the group that was treated with 4% doxycycline barrier compared to the other two groups. Vertical bone fill was 0.89, 1.44, and 1.18 mm for the BG+PDox, BG+P, and BG groups, respectively. Furcation horizontal bone was 2.33, 2.11, and 1.18 mm for the BG+PDox, BG+P, and BG groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of doxycycline to the guided tissue regeneration barrier did not enhance treatment outcomes compared to the non-antibiotic-loaded barrier or bone graft alone. All treatment modalities provided similar improvement in clinical and intrasurgical parameters.

22414722|t|The two different effects of the potential neuroprotective compound minocycline on AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
22414722|a|BACKGROUND: Minocycline has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in experimental neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is any direct interaction between minocycline and the AMPA-type receptor channels, and to elucidate the underlying molecular pharmacological mechanisms. METHODS: The patch-clamp technique was used combined with an ultrafast solution exchange system to investigate the interaction of minocycline with recombinant AMPA-type glutamate receptor channels (homomeric GluR2flipGQ or nondesensitizing GluR2L504Y). RESULTS: Dose-dependent decreases in the relative peak current amplitude (rAmp) and the relative steady-state current (rC(des)) were found in coapplication experiments with GluR2L504Y receptors, but not in preincubation experiments. Furthermore, coapplication of 1 or 3 mmol/l minocycline showed a decrease in the fast time constant of current decay, and reopening currents were observed. But in the test with GluR2flipGQ receptors, rAmp, relative area under the curve and rC(des) increased with increasing concentrations of minocycline, and the steady-state time constant also increased when 3 µmol/l glutamate were used as agonist. CONCLUSION: Minocycline modulates AMPA-type receptor channels in a combination of a weaker open-channel block effect and a stronger potentiation effect, and the latter effect arises mainly from attenuating the extent of receptor desensitization.

14586216|t|A phase II study of topotecan in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma.
14586216|a|To determine the efficacy and toxicity of a novel chemotherapeutic approach with topotecan, a camptothecin analog, for progressive or recurring anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma.Patients from seven centers with recurrent or progressive disease were treated with topotecan, 1.5 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.), 30 min dailyx5 days every 3 weeks. Efficacy and toxicity were assessed clinically and radiologically. The study was planned to accrue up to 30 evaluable patients if there was at least one response among the first 15 patients treated. Sixteen eligible patients entered the study. No response was documented in 14 evaluable patients. Eleven patients had stable disease of a median of 3.8 months and three had progressive disease. Sixteen patients were evaluable for toxicity. The most significant toxic effect was myelosuppression. Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was experienced by 15 of 16 patients and led to dose reduction in nearly half of the cycles delivered. Other adverse effects were fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, alopecia, and vomiting.Topotecan, delivered in the dailyx5 regimen, is relatively well tolerated. We could not demonstrate significant activity among the population studied to justify completing accrual to 30 patients. Topotecan did not demonstrate, with this small sample size, efficacy as a salvage chemotherapy monotherapy after exposure to procarbazine, CCNU and vincristine. Further trials with different agents in this indication are certainly warranted.

12390945|t|Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment improves endothelial function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
12390945|a|BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Striking similarities exist in the inflammatory and immunologic response in RA and atherosclerosis. Indeed, adhesion molecules and cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in particular, are key mediators of joint inflammation and of vascular dysfunction and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of chronic antiinflammatory treatment with the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab on disease activity and endothelial function in patients with active RA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven RA patients (mean age 46+/-5 years; disease duration 9+/-2 years) with high disease activity despite treatment with stable doses of methotrexate (<or=25 mg/wk) and prednisone (<or=10 mg/d) were investigated. Clinical status and endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation of the brachial artery as assessed by high-resolution ultrasound were measured before and after 12 weeks of infliximab therapy. Flow-mediated vasodilation improved from 3.2+/-0.4% to 4.1+/-0.5% (P=0.018), whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation with nitroglycerin and baseline diameter remained unchanged (13.6+/-1.2% versus 12.8+/-1.4%, P=0.98, and 3.74+/-0.15 versus 3.66+/-0.11 mm, P=0.54, respectively). Disease activity score (DAS28) was significantly reduced, from 5.6+/-0.3 to 3.5+/-0.6 (P=0.002). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were lowered from 34+/-7 to 19+/-5 mm/h (P=0.04) and from 38+/-11 to 15+/-10 mg/L (P=0.08), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that anti-TNF-alpha treatment improves endothelial function in RA. The data suggest that in RA, endothelial dysfunction is part of the disease process and is mediated by TNF-alpha.

11924763|a|Cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibitory assay-guided purification of ethyl acetate extract of Piper methysticum (kava kava) roots yielded six biologically active compounds (1-7), which were purified using MPLC, preparative TLC and HPLC methods. These compounds were also evaluated for antioxidant activities. Dihydrokawain (1) and yangonin (6) showed the highest COX-I and COX-II inhibitory activities at 100 microg/ml, respectively. The lipid oxidation assay did not reveal antioxidant activities for demethoxyangonin (2), dihydrokawain (1), kawain (4), dihydromethysticin (5) or methysticin (7) at 50 microg/ml. The antioxidant activities of flavokawain A (3) and yangonin (6) could not be tested in the lipid oxidation assay due to solubility problems. However, yangonin and methysticin showed moderate antioxidant activities in the free radical scavenging assay at 2.5 mg/ml.

7641902|t|A new system for fallopian tube sperm perfusion leads to pregnancy rates twice as high as standard intrauterine insemination.
7641902|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative efficacy of a new system for fallopian tube sperm perfusion in comparison with standard IUI in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycles. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTING: Ovulation induction program of a tertiary outpatient care center, HÃ´pital Antoine BÃ©clÃ¨re, Clamart, France. PATIENTS: We studied 74 infertile women aged 20 to 38 years undergoing 100 cycles of COH from December 1993 to May 1994 only excluding cases of age > 38 years, obstructed or severely damaged fallopian tubes, E2 levels per mature follicle < 250 pg/mL (conversion factor to SI unit, 3.671) on the day of hCG administration, spontaneous LH surge, and cases of marked sperm abnormalities. INTERVENTIONS: Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was achieved using three types of ovarian stimulation protocols: clomiphene citrate (CC) and hMG (n = 35). hMG alone (n = 35) or GnRH agonist and FSH and hMG (n = 30). Thirty-six hours after hCG administration, patients were assigned randomly to either IUI (group A, n = 50) or fallopian tube sperm perfusion (group B, n = 50). Intrauterine insemination was performed with 0.2 mL of sperm suspension according to a standard technique. Fallopian tube sperm perfusion was performed using a simple and reliable system that ensures a good cervical seal and allows to a pressurized injection of 4 mL of sperm suspension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility of the fallopian tube sperm perfusion method, clinical pregnancy (presence of gestational sac with heart beats at 6 weeks of amenorrhea), and ongoing pregnancy rates (PRs) (> 12 weeks of amenorrhea), incidence of complications (multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [OHSS]). RESULTS: Overall, the new fallopian tube sperm perfusion system was simple to handle and well tolerated by patients. In group A, we observed 10 clinical pregnancies (20% per cycle) of which 7 were ongoing (14%). In group B, 20 clinical pregnancies (40% per cycle) of which 17 ongoing pregnancies (34%) were obtained. These differences were statistically significant. The prevalence of twin and three or more sac pregnancies was similar in the two groups (3/10 and 0/10, respectively, in group A, and 5/20 and 2/20, respectively, in group B). No case of moderate or severe OHSS was observed in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the new system for fallopian tube sperm perfusion is not only simple and reliable but also may lead to PRs twice as high as standard IUI in COH cycles.

23710204|t|Synergy between vitamin D(3) and Toll-like receptor agonists regulates human dendritic cell response during maturation.
23710204|a|Human dendritic cells (DC) can be differentiated from blood monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 and matured by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Vitamin D3 inhibits the maturation of human DC measured by changes in surface expression of HLA-DR, CD14, CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86. We here examine the function of vitamin D3 during DC maturation. One of the earliest changes to LPS-induced maturation was an increase in CD83 expression. Vitamin D3 inhibited the increase in expression of HLA-DR, CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD86 and the decrease in expression of CD14, which was paralleled morphologically by vitamin D3-induced inhibition of dendritic cell differentiation. Vitamin D3 acted in synergy with the TLR agonists LPS and peptidoglycan (PGN) in inducing IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, whereas vitamin D3 completely inhibited LPS-induced secretion of IL-12. The synergy occurred at concentrations where neither vitamin D3 nor the TLR agonists alone induced measurable cytokine secretion. Both LPS and PGN enhanced the level of the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR). Taken together, these data demonstrated that vitamin D3 and TLR agonists acted in synergy to alter secretion of cytokines from human DC in a direction that may provide an anti-inflammatory environment.

12187291|t|Supplementation of infant formula with the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and zinc: impact on enteric infection and nutrition in infant rhesus monkeys.
12187291|a|Gut colonization by may have beneficial effects on infant health or capacity to resist infectious disease. Zinc supplementation has also been proposed to increase infants' resistance to disease; however, many studies have yielded conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: To study effects of probiotic supplementation of infant formula (with or without supplemental zinc) on nutritional status, gut colonization and the ability to resist gastrointestinal infection in an infant rhesus monkey model. METHODS: Infant monkeys were fed control infant formula (5 mg Zn/L), control formula with or control formula with and supplemental zinc (15 mg Zn/L) from birth to 4 months. Growth, nutritional status, mineral absorption, intestinal colonization and frequency and severity of enteropathogenic -induced gastroenteritis were monitored. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal colonization was achieved and was associated with increased ileal villous surface area and improved hematocrit, with no adverse effects on growth or nutritional indices. Fortification to 15 mg Zn/L reduced plasma copper, erythrocyte Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, hemoglobin, and iron absorption. Infants fed -supplemented formula had reduced diarrhea severity throughout the study period and recovered more rapidly from acute diarrhea than the other groups. CONCLUSION: -supplementation of infant formula is safe, improves iron status and decreases diarrhea severity in infant rhesus monkeys and thus may help protect formula-fed human infants from infection and nutritional deficiencies.

21332728|t|The low viability of human CD34+ cells under acidic conditions is improved by exposure to thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, interleukin-3, or increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels.
21332728|a|BACKGROUND: Transplanted hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) have shown great promise in regenerative medicine. However, the therapeutic potential of transplanted cells is limited by their poor viability. It is well known that the microenvironment in which progenitors reside substantially affects their behavior. Because extracellular acidosis is a common feature of injured tissues or the tumor microenvironment and is a critical regulator of cell survival and activation, we evaluated the impact of acidosis on CD34+ cell biology. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and binding of annexin V, hypodiploid cells, Bcl-xL expression, active caspase-3, and mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by flow cytometry. Colony-forming units were studied by clonogenic assays, and cell cycle was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Exposure of CD34+ cells to low pH (7.0-6.5) caused intracellular acidification, decreased cell proliferation, and triggered apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Whereas exposure to thrombopoietin (TPO), stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin (IL)-3 or increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels prevented CD34+ cell death induced by acidic conditions, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand, erythropoietin, and vascular endothelial growth factor had no effect. Despite their cytoprotective effect, CD34+ cell expansion triggered by TPO, SCF, or IL-3 was significantly impaired at low pH. However, a cocktail of these three cytokines synergistically supported proliferation, cell cycle progression, and colony formation. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that an acidic milieu is deleterious for CD34+ cells and that a combination of certain cytokines and cAMP donors may improve cell viability and function. These data may be useful to develop new therapeutic strategies or to optimize protocols for regenerative medicine.

23717555|t|4-HNE increases intracellular ADMA levels in cultured HUVECs: evidence for miR-21-dependent mechanisms.
23717555|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) regulates asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) metabolism through pathway independent of direct adduct formation with ADMA metabolizing enzyme and the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) miR-21 in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: Cultured HUVECs were treated with 4-HNE (at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10  µM, respectively) or 1  ° DMSO (vehicle control) for 24 h. MiR-21 inhibitor (final concentration of 100 nM) was transfected at 1 h before 4-HNE treatment. HUVECs were also transfected with miR-21 (at concentrations of 50 nM and 100 nM) and cultured for 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. DDAH mRNA and miR-21 expression in the HUVECs were determined by semi-quantitative real time PCR. DDAH1 and DDAH2 protein expression were analyzed by Western blot. ADMA in the cell medium and cell lysates were analyzed by ELISA. ADMA metabolizing activity of the cell lysates was also determined. RESULTS: MiR-21 decreased DDAH1 and DDAH2 expression and ADMA metabolic activity significantly, while increased intracellular ADMA accumulation significantly in HUVECs. 10  µM 4-HNE treatment for 24 h increased the expression of miR-21 and intracellular ADMA concentration, decreased the expression of DDAH1/2 mRNA and protein, decreased ADMA metabolizing activity of the cell lysates significantly. MiR-21 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effects of 4-HNE on DDAH1 expression completely, and partially reversed the changes in ADMA metabolizing activity and intracellular ADMA accumulation challenged by 10  µM 4-HNE. CONCLUSION: 4-HNE down-regulates DDAH1 expression and increases intracellular ADMA accumulation in HUVECs through a miR-21-dependent mechanism.

8495764|t|Vaginal patterns during danazol and buserelin acetate therapy for endometriosis: structural and ultrastructural study.
8495764|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate histologic and ultrastructural changes of the vaginal mucosa in patients given buserelin acetate or danazol treatment for endometriosis. DESIGN: Controlled clinical study. SETTING: Infertility clinic of an academic unit. PATIENTS: Infertile women with endometriosis randomized to receive buserelin acetate or danazol and undergoing vaginal biopsies during treatment were selected. INTERVENTIONS: Buserelin acetate was administered IN 400 micrograms three times per day and danazol orally 600 mg/d. Vaginal biopsies were performed baseline and at 3 and 6 months of treatment, and specimens were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. 17 beta-Estradiol and P levels were determined in each patient at the time of each biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Structural and ultrastructural patterns of vaginal mucosa after 3 and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Buserelin acetate treatment induced early, marked hypotrophy of the vaginal mucosa with aspects typical of the menopause. The modifications caused by danazol occurred mainly in the intermediate layer, which was weakly hypotrophic only at the end of the treatment. CONCLUSION: Vaginal mucosa undergoes constant and well-defined modifications during both buserelin acetate and danazol treatment for endometriosis. The modifications are compatible with the biological effects of the drugs.

25296108|t|Neurophysiological correlates of sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness.
25296108|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness in humans have focused predominantly on the intravenous drug propofol and have identified anterior dominance of alpha rhythms and frontal phase-amplitude coupling patterns as neurophysiological markers. However, it is unclear whether the correlates of propofol-induced unconsciousness are generalizable to inhaled anesthetics, which have distinct molecular targets and which are used more commonly in clinical practice. METHODS: The authors recorded 64-channel electroencephalograms in healthy human participants during consciousness, sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness, and recovery (n = 10; n = 7 suitable for analysis). Spectrograms and scalp distributions of low-frequency (1 Hz) and alpha (10 Hz) power were analyzed, and phase-amplitude modulation between these two frequencies was calculated in frontal and parietal regions. Phase lag index was used to assess phase relationships across the cortex. RESULTS: At concentrations sufficient for unconsciousness, sevoflurane did not result in a consistent anteriorization of alpha power; the relationship between low-frequency phase and alpha amplitude in the frontal cortex did not undergo characteristic transitions. By contrast, there was significant cross-frequency coupling in the parietal region during consciousness that was not observed after loss of consciousness. Furthermore, a reversible disruption of anterior-posterior phase relationships in the alpha bandwidth was identified as a correlate of sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness. CONCLUSION: In humans, sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness is not correlated with anteriorization of alpha and related cross-frequency patterns, but rather by a disruption of phase-amplitude coupling in the parietal region and phase-phase relationships across the cortex.

22892116|a|We describe the discovery of potent and orally bioavailable tetrahydropyridopyrimidine inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 10A by systematic optimization of a novel HTS lead. Lead compound THPP-1 exhibits nanomolar potencies, excellent pharmacokinetic properties, and a clean off-target profile. It displays in vivo target engagement as measured by increased rat striatal cGMP levels upon oral dosing. It shows dose-dependent efficacy in a key pharmacodynamic assay predictive of antipsychotic activity, the psychostimulant-induced rat hyperlocomotion assay. Further, THPP-1 displays significantly fewer preclinical adverse events in assays measuring prolactin secretion, catalepsy, and weight gain, in contrast to the typical and atypical antipsychotics haloperidol and olanzapine.

17079735|t|Connexin hemichannels and gap junction channels are differentially influenced by lipopolysaccharide and basic fibroblast growth factor.
17079735|a|Gap junction (GJ) channels are formed by two hemichannels (connexons), each contributed by the cells taking part in this direct cell-cell communication conduit. Hemichannels that do not interact with their counterparts on neighboring cells feature as a release pathway for small paracrine messengers such as nucleotides, glutamate, and prostaglandins. Connexins are phosphorylated by various kinases, and we compared the effect of various kinase-activating stimuli on GJ channels and hemichannels. Using peptides identical to a short connexin (Cx) amino acid sequence to specifically block hemichannels, we found that protein kinase C, Src, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) inhibited GJs and hemichannel-mediated ATP release in Cx43-expressing C6 glioma cells (C6-Cx43). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) inhibited GJs, but they stimulated ATP release via hemichannels in C6-Cx43. LPS and bFGF inhibited hemichannel-mediated ATP release in HeLa-Cx43 cells, but they stimulated it in HeLa-Cx43 with a truncated carboxy-terminal (CT) domain or in HeLa-Cx26, which has a very short CT. Hemichannel potentiation by LPS was inhibited by blockers of the arachidonic acid metabolism, and arachidonic acid had a potentiating effect like LPS and bFGF. We conclude that GJ channels and hemichannels display similar or oppositely directed responses to modulatory influences, depending on the balance between kinase activity and the activity of the arachidonic acid pathway. Distinctive hemichannel responses to pathological stimulation with LPS or bFGF may serve to optimize the cell response, directed at strictly controlling cellular ATP release, switching from direct GJ communication to indirect paracrine signaling, or maximizing cell-protective strategies.

25114106|t|6-Methoxyflavone inhibits NFAT translocation into the nucleus and suppresses T cell activation.
25114106|a|NFAT plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating the transcription of inducible genes during immune responses. In T cells, NFAT proteins govern various cellular events related to T cell development, activation, tolerance induction, and differentiation. We previously reported the NFAT1-dependent enhancer activity of conserved noncoding sequence (CNS)-9, a distal cis-acting element, in the regulation of IL-10 transcription in T cells. In this study, we developed a T cell-based reporter system to identify compounds that modulate the regulatory activity of CNS-9. Among the identified candidates, 6-methoxyflavone (6-MF) significantly inhibited the enhancer activity of CNS-9, thereby reducing IL-10 expression in T cells without affecting cell viability. 6-MF also downregulated the transcription of NFAT1 target genes such as IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-y. Treatment of 6-MF inhibited the translocation of NFAT1 into the nucleus, which consequently interrupted NFAT1 binding to the target loci, without affecting the expression or dephosphorylation of NFAT1. Treatment of 6-MF to CD4(+) T cells or B cells isolated from mice with atopic dermatitis significantly reduced disease-associated cytokine production, as well as the levels of IgE. In addition, oral administration of 6-MF to atopic dermatitis mice ameliorated disease symptoms by reducing serum IgE levels and infiltrating lymphocytes. Conclusively, our results suggest that 6-MF can be a potential candidate for the development of an effective immunomodulator via the suppression of NFAT-mediated T cell activation.

17504172|t|Progress in understanding basal ganglia dysfunction as a common target for methamphetamine abuse and HIV-1 neurodegeneration.
17504172|a|HIV-1 infection with concurrent methamphetamine (MA) abuse results in exacerbated neurodegenerative changes and rapid progression of a form of sub-cortical dementia termed HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD). A notable feature of HAD is the involvement of the dopaminergic system manifested as parkinsonian like movement abnormalities. The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein is very often used in experimental studies trying to understand neurotoxic consequences of HIV-1 infection, since the pathophysiological changes induced by Tat mirrors, in part, the means by which HIV-1 infection of the nervous system results in neuronal damage. Understanding the interaction of Tat and MA in the basal ganglia and the resultant injury to the dopaminergic system in rodent models as well as cell culture will shed light on the dopaminergic pathology occurring in HIV-1 infected-MA abusers. The aim of this review is to update the reader on the current knowledge of MA and HIV-1 neurotoxicity, specifically Tat, and discuss the progress in understanding how MA synergizes with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat to damage the basal ganglia.

9823441|t|Magnesium loading effect on magnesium deficiency in endurance-trained subjects during prolonged restriction of muscular activity.
9823441|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of magnesium (Mg) loading (10.0 mg Mg/kg body wt) and daily Mg supplements (5.0 mg Mg/kg body wt) on Mg deficiency shown by increased and not by decreased serum Mg concentration during hypokinesia (decreased km number/d). The studies were done during 30 d of prehypokinesia and 364 d of hypokinesia (HK) periods. Forty endurance-trained volunteers aged 22-26 yr with a peak VO2 max of 66.3 mL.kg-1 min-1 and with an average 15.0 km/d running distance were chosen as subjects. They were equally divided into four groups: 1. Unsupplemented ambulatory control subjects (UACS). 2. Unsupplemented hypokinetic subjects (UHKS). 3. Supplemented hypokinetic subjects (SHKS). 4. Supplemented ambulatory control subjects (SACS). The SHKS and SACS groups took daily 5.0 mg elemental Mg/kg body wt and subjected to Mg loading (10.0 mg Mg/kg body wt). Both the SHKS and UHKS groups were maintained under an average running distance of 4.7 km/d, whereas the SACS and UACS groups did not experience any modifications to their normal training routines and diets. During the prehypokinetic and hypokinetic periods, excretion of Mg in feces and urine, concentration of Mg in serum, and Mg balance were measured. Urinary and serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) were also determined. In both SHKS and UHKS groups, fecal Mg loss, urinary excretion of electrolytes, and serum concentrations of electrolytes increased significantly (p < or = 0.05) when compared with the SACS and UACS groups. During Mg loading tests, urinary and fecal Mg excretion was also greater in the SHKS and UHKS groups than in the SACS and UACS groups. Throughout the study, Mg balance was negative in the SHKS and UHKS groups, whereas in the SACS and UACS groups, Mg balance was positive. It was concluded that significant losses of Mg occurred in the presence of negative Mg balance and Mg deficiency in endurance-trained subjects during prolonged exposure to HK, daily mg supplements, and Mg loading tests. This suggests that Mg is not entering or being retaining by the bones and cells of many tissues where most Mg is deposited normally, resulting in Mg deficiency as was shown by the increased serum Mg concentration.

25023392|t|The effect of stable macromolecular complexes of ionic polyphosphazene on HIV Gag antigen and on activation of human dendritic cells and presentation to T-cells.
25023392|a|Neonates and infants are susceptible to infection due to distinct immune responses in early life. Therefore, development of vaccine formulation and delivery systems capable of activating human newborn leukocytes is of global health importance. Poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene] (PCPP) belongs to a family of ionic synthetic polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte compounds that can form non-covalent interactions with protein antigens and demonstrate adjuvant activity in animals and in human clinical trials. However, little is known about their ability to activate human immune cells. In this study, we characterized the effects of PCPP alone or in combination with a model antigen (recombinant HIV-Gag (Gag)), on the maturation, activation and antigen presentation by human adult and newborn dendritic cells (DCs) in  vitro. PCPP treatment induced DC activation as assessed by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production. Studies benchmarking PCPP to Alum, the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, demonstrated that both triggered cell death and release of danger signals in adult and newborn DCs. When complexed with Gag antigen, PCPP maintained its immunostimulatory characteristics while permitting internalization and presentation of Gag by DCs to HIV-Gag-specific CD4(+) T cell clones. The PCPP vaccine formulation outlined here has intrinsic adjuvant activity, can facilitate effective delivery of antigen to DCs, and may be advantageous for induction of beneficial T cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, polyphosphazenes can further reduce cost of vaccine production and distribution through their dose-sparing and antigen-stabilizing properties, thus potentially eliminating the need for cold chain distribution.

15616079|t|A randomized comparison of three methods of analgesia for chest drain removal in postcardiac surgical patients.
15616079|a|Sixty-six patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft and/or valve surgery were recruited in a prospective, randomized study designed to compare the effectiveness of three analgesic regimens for chest drain removal. Patients were randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine, 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine infiltrated subcutaneously, or inhaled 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen (Entonox) via a demand valve. We assessed pain by measuring visual analog scale pain scores before and during drain removal. Median (25th, 75th centile) visual analog scale pain scores associated with drain removal in the bupivacaine, Entonox, and morphine groups were 9.5 mm (3, 18 mm), 37.0 mm (13, 56 mm), and 15.0 mm (7, 27 mm), respectively. The pain scores were higher in the Entonox group compared with the bupivacaine group (P=0.005) and the morphine group (P=0.047). Differences between baseline and drain-removal scores were -0.5 mm (-13, 7 mm), +10 mm (1, 29 mm), and -3.0 mm (-11, 12 mm), respectively. There was no difference among groups in arterial blood pressure, heart rate, PaCO2, oxygenation, or sedation. Bupivacaine and morphine, unlike Entonox, produce lower pain scores associated with drain removal.

20373668|t|Psychiatric pharmacogenomic testing in clinical practice.
20373668|a|The clinical adoption of psychiatric pharmacogenomic testing has taken place rapidly over the past 7 years. Initially, drug-metabolizing enzyme genes, such as the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6), were identified. Genotyping the highly variable cytochrome P450 2D6 gene now provides clinicians with the opportunity to identify both poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers of 2D6 substrate medications. Subsequently, genes influencing the pharmacodynamic response of medications have been made available for clinical practice. Among the earliest "target genes" was the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) which has variants that have been shown to influence the clinical response of patients of European ancestry when they are treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Genotyping of some of the serotonin receptor genes is also available to guide clinical practice. The quantification of the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic testing is evolving, and ethical considerations for testing have been established. Given the increasingly clear cost-effectiveness of genotyping, it has recently been predicted that pharmacogenomic testing will routinely be ordered to guide the selection and dosing of psychotropic medications.

16829684|t|A role for UV-light-induced c-Fos: Stimulation of nucleotide excision repair and protection against sustained JNK activation and apoptosis.
16829684|a|UV light (UV-C) is a potent inducer of the c-fos gene. Cells lacking c-Fos are hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effect of UV-C indicating a protective role of c-fos induction. Here we show that cells deficient in c-Fos (fos-/-) are unable to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) from DNA and undergo apoptosis at high frequency via the Fas pathway. We also show that in c-Fos-deficient cells the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by UV-C differs from the wild-type (wt, fos+/+). In wt cells JNK activation is transient, returning to control level 5-8 h after treatment, whereas in c-Fos-deficient cells JNK activation was long-lasting and did not return to control level. Inhibition of early JNK activation by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated CPD repair and increased UV-C induced apoptosis whereas inhibition of late JNK activation attenuated the apoptotic response of c-Fos-deficient cells. Late and sustained activation of JNK resulted in upregulation of fas (CD95, apo-1) ligand and induction of caspase 8-dependent apoptosis. The data indicate that the immediate-early induction of the JNK/c-fos pathway stimulates the repair of UV-C induced DNA lesions that protects against apoptosis. If this does not occur, cells do not recover from transcription blockage leading, as shown for c-Fos-deficient cells, to a reduced expression of MKP1, sustained JNK activation and fasL overexpression that finally results in activation of the death receptor pathway. The data support the hypothesis that non-repaired DNA damage is the cause for the late and sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway in response to genotoxins.

21954910|t|Development of bifunctional stilbene derivatives for targeting and modulating metal-amyloid-b species.
21954910|a|Amyloid-b (Ab) peptides and their metal-associated aggregated states have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the etiology of AD remains uncertain, understanding the role of metal-Ab species could provide insights into the onset and development of the disease. To unravel this, bifunctional small molecules that can specifically target and modulate metal-Ab species have been developed, which could serve as suitable chemical tools for investigating metal-Ab-associated events in AD. Through a rational structure-based design principle involving the incorporation of a metal binding site into the structure of an Ab interacting molecule, we devised stilbene derivatives (L1-a and L1-b) and demonstrated their reactivity toward metal-Ab species. In particular, the dual functions of compounds with different structural features (e.g., with or without a dimethylamino group) were explored by UV-vis, X-ray crystallography, high-resolution 2D NMR, and docking studies. Enhanced bifunctionality of compounds provided greater effects on metal-induced Ab aggregation and neurotoxicity in vitro and in living cells. Mechanistic investigations of the reaction of L1-a and L1-b with Zn(2+)-Ab species by UV-vis and 2D NMR suggest that metal chelation with ligand and/or metal-ligand interaction with the Ab peptide may be driving factors for the observed modulation of metal-Ab aggregation pathways. Overall, the studies presented herein demonstrate the importance of a structure-interaction-reactivity relationship for designing small molecules to target metal-Ab species allowing for the modulation of metal-induced Ab reactivity and neurotoxicity.

8067645|t|Effect of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, on sleep apnea in patients with acromegaly.
8067645|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, on the severity of sleep apnea and on growth hormone levels in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Open-label, prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: 19 patients with active acromegaly. INTERVENTION: Octreotide in a 6-month, stepwise incremental dosage. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep studies and indices of hormonal activity (levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] and growth hormone). RESULTS: A 50% decrease occurred in the respiratory disturbance index (baseline compared with 6 months, 39 events/h compared with 19 events/h; P = 0.0002), and a 40% decrease occurred in total apnea time (27.6% of total sleep time compared with 15.1%; P = 0.001). Indices of oxygen desaturation, sleep quality, and subjective sleepiness improved after 6 months of octreotide. A parallel decrease was noted in mean levels of growth hormone (40.0 micrograms/L compared with 9.1 micrograms/L; P = 0.003) and IGF-1 (107 nmol/L compared with 47 nmol/L; P = 0.0001). However, no correlation was noted between the decrease in the total amount of sleep time spent in apnea and the decrease in growth hormone levels (rho = -0.35; P > 0.2). The residual respiratory disturbance index after 6 months of treatment was similar in patients who improved, regardless of whether or not biochemical remission (IGF-1 < 35 nmol/L) occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in indices of sleep apnea severity occurs in association with octreotide treatment in patients with sleep apnea and acromegaly. However, sleep apnea may either persist despite normalization of growth hormone levels or may improve markedly even if there is only partial biochemical remission.

9507220|t|Bindarit retards renal disease and prolongs survival in murine lupus autoimmune disease.
9507220|a|As an alternative to classical immunosuppressants in experimental lupus nephritis, we looked at bindarit, 2-methyl-2-[[1-phenylmethyl)-1H-indazol-3-y1]methoxy]propanoic acid, a novel molecule devoid of immunosuppressive effects, which selectively reduces chronic inflammation in rat adjuvant arthritis. Two groups of NZB/W mice (N = 55 for each group) were given bindarit, (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle starting at 2 months of age. Mice were sacrificed at 2, 6, 8 and 10 months or used for survival studies. Bindarit delayed the onset of proteinuria (% proteinuric mice, bindarit vs. vehicle, 6 months: 0 vs. 33% and 8 months: 7% vs. 60%, P < 0.005; 10 months: 53% vs. 80%) and significantly (P < 0.05) protected from renal function impairment (serum BUN, bindarit vs. vehicle: 8 months, 30 +/- 3 vs. 127 +/- 42; 10 months, 53 +/-5 vs. 140 +/- 37 mg/dl). Appearance of anti-DNA antibodies was retarded and survival significantly (P < 0.0001) prolonged by bindarit (% survival, bindarit vs. vehicle: 8 months, 100% vs. 80%; 10 months, 87% vs. 40%; 12 months, 27% vs. 20%). Bindarit significantly limited glomerular hypercellularity, interstitial inflammation and tubular damage. Renal expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) mRNA (Northern blot) markedly increased (7 - 12-fold in 8- 10-month-old mice vs. 2-month-old) during the progression of nephritis in association with mononuclear cell infiltration. Bindarit completely prevented MCP-1 up-regulation. In another series of experiments, bindarit (0.25% and 0.5% medicated diet, N = 16 for each group) when started at 4.5 months of age in NZB/W mice improved survival in respect to untreated mice (N = 17) in a dose-dependent manner (% survival: 8 months, 94% and 100%, respectively, vs. 47%; 10 months, 75% and 100% vs. 35%; 12 months, 31% and 75% vs. 12%). Survival was even more prolonged when bindarit (0.5% medicated diet) was combined with a low dose of methylprednisolone (1.5 mg/kg i.p.), which that only partially modifies proteinuria and survival of lupus mice, in an additional group of animals (N = 16). Thus, at 14.5 months when all mice given bindarit alone died, 50% of mice on combined therapy were still alive (P < 0.023). Studies are needed to establish whether bindarit may function as a steroid sparing drug in human lupus.

8227045|t|Lipophilic 1,1-bisphosphonates are potent squalene synthase inhibitors and orally active cholesterol lowering agents in vivo.
8227045|a|Squalene synthase catalyzes the reductive dimerization of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to form squalene at the final branchpoint of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. We report herein that isoprenyl 1,1-bisphosphonates and related analogs are potent inhibitors of rat microsomal squalene synthase (I50 = 0.7-32 nM). In addition, members of this family are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats on intravenous and oral dosing, as well as cholesterol lowering agents in rats and hamsters. Significant inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in rats by lovastatin occurs with a concomitant inhibition of dolichol and coenzyme-Q9 synthesis. In contrast, bisphosphonate 4 has no effect on dolichol and coenzyme-Q9 biosynthesis in rats under conditions where cholesterol biosynthesis is > 90% inhibited.

18359332|t|The antiplatelet effect of six non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their pharmacodynamic interaction with aspirin in healthy volunteers.
18359332|a|Patients with cardiovascular disease taking aspirin and some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to have increased vascular events. This study was conducted to compare the ex vivo antiplatelet effects of 6 commonly used NSAIDs and to determine whether these agents antagonize the effect of aspirin. Platelet function was assessed by Platelet Function Analyzer 100 closure time in normal subjects in a randomized, blinded, multiple-crossover study. Platelet function was measured 12 hours after the administration of each NSAID. The NSAID was then given 2 hours before aspirin 300 mg, and platelet function was reassessed 24 hours later. At 12 hours after the administration of naproxen and tiaprofenic acid, closure time was significantly prolonged, whereas the other NSAIDs did not cause significant prolongations. Compared with placebo plus aspirin, closure time was significantly reduced when ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, or tiaprofenic acid was given before aspirin. In conclusion, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, and tiaprofenic acid all block the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. Sulindac and celecoxib did not demonstrate any significant antiplatelet effect or reduce the antiplatelet of aspirin and, therefore, of the NSAIDs evaluated may be the drugs of choice for patients requiring aspirin and NSAIDs.

10894216|t|Visual impairment in children with epilepsy treated with vigabatrin.
10894216|a|Vigabatrin is an anti-epileptic drug particularly useful for drug-resistant partial seizures and infantile spasms. Recently, vigabatrin-induced visual field constriction (VFC) and abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies were reported. In this study, we assessed visual fields, visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and electroretinography (ERG) in children treated with vigabatrin. Twenty-four visually asymptomatic children underwent a clinical ophthalmological examination, perimetry when appropriate, and VEP and ERG. Thirteen patients had at least one abnormal study. VFC was seen in 11 of 17 patients who had perimetry; 5 of 15 patients who underwent VEP testing and 4 of 11 who underwent ERG testing had abnormal examinations. For the most part, abnormal VEPs and ERGs were found in children who also had VFC. There was a consistent trend for longer treatment periods to correlate with VFC, abnormal ERGs, and VEPs. In summary, over half of the children treated with vigabatrin demonstrated VFC or abnormal ocular electrophysiological studies. Perimetry seemed to be the most sensitive modality for identifying vigabatrin toxicity. Abnormal ERGs and VEPs were primarily seen in children with VFC and may be useful in monitoring children who are not appropriate candidates for perimetry. Although the incidence of vigabatrin-induced VFC is worrisome, in the context of intractable seizures or infantile spasms, therapeutic benefits must be weighed against risks.

24429287|t|Mitochondria-targeted Ogg1 and aconitase-2 prevent oxidant-induced mitochondrial DNA damage in alveolar epithelial cells.
24429287|a|Mitochondria-targeted human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (mt-hOgg1) and aconitase-2 (Aco-2) each reduce oxidant-induced alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, but it is unclear whether protection occurs by preventing AEC mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Using quantitative PCR-based measurements of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage, mtDNA damage was preferentially noted in AEC after exposure to oxidative stress (e.g. amosite asbestos (5-25 µg/cm(2)) or H2O2 (100-250 µM)) for 24 h. Overexpression of wild-type mt-hOgg1 or mt-long a/b 317-323 hOgg1 mutant incapable of DNA repair (mt-hOgg1-Mut) each blocked A549 cell oxidant-induced mtDNA damage, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and intrinsic apoptosis as assessed by DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-9. In contrast, compared with controls, knockdown of Ogg1 (using Ogg1 shRNA in A549 cells or primary alveolar type 2 cells from ogg1(-/-) mice) augmented mtDNA lesions and intrinsic apoptosis at base line, and these effects were increased further after exposure to oxidative stress. Notably, overexpression of Aco-2 reduced oxidant-induced mtDNA lesions, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and apoptosis, whereas siRNA for Aco-2 (siAco-2) enhanced mtDNA damage, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and apoptosis. Finally, siAco-2 attenuated the protective effects of mt-hOgg1-Mut but not wild-type mt-hOgg1 against oxidant-induced mtDNA damage and apoptosis. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel role for mt-hOgg1 and Aco-2 in preserving AEC mtDNA integrity, thereby preventing oxidant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, p53 mitochondrial translocation, and intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, mt-hOgg1 chaperoning of Aco-2 in preventing oxidant-mediated mtDNA damage and apoptosis may afford an innovative target for the molecular events underlying oxidant-induced toxicity.

24339759|t|Systems modeling of anti-apoptotic pathways in prostate cancer: psychological stress triggers a synergism pattern switch in drug combination therapy.
24339759|a|Prostate cancer patients often have increased levels of psychological stress or anxiety, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between psychological stress and prostate cancer as well as therapy resistance have been rarely studied and remain poorly understood. Recent reports show that stress inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via epinephrine/beta2 adrenergic receptor/PKA/BAD pathway. In this study, we used experimental data on the signaling pathways that control BAD phosphorylation to build a dynamic network model of apoptosis regulation in prostate cancer cells. We then compared the predictive power of two different models with or without the role of Mcl-1, which justified the role of Mcl-1 stabilization in anti-apoptotic effects of emotional stress. Based on the selected model, we examined and quantitatively evaluated the induction of apoptosis by drug combination therapies. We predicted that the combination of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and inhibition of BAD phosphorylation at S112 would produce the best synergistic effect among 8 interventions examined. Experimental validation confirmed the effectiveness of our predictive model. Moreover, we found that epinephrine signaling changes the synergism pattern and decreases efficacy of combination therapy. The molecular mechanisms responsible for therapeutic resistance and the switch in synergism were explored by analyzing a network model of signaling pathways affected by psychological stress. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of psychological stress signaling in therapy-resistant cancer, and indicate the potential benefit of reducing psychological stress in designing more effective therapies for prostate cancer patients.

17545776|t|Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease.
17545776|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutrition plays a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often found to have nutrient deficiencies at the time of diagnosis, whereas others develop features of malnutrition over the course of their illness. Therefore, an understanding of the relationship between nutrients and inflammatory bowel disease is important if these patients are to receive optimal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic and basic research has helped to shed light on the interaction between diet and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Numerous clinical trials utilizing various types of lipids, including fish oil and short chain fatty acids, suggest that fats play an important role in the inflammatory response that characterizes inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamins and other micronutrients involved in nutrient metabolism and modulation of oxidative stress are also considered in this review. SUMMARY: This update discusses nutritional issues that can be used to help prevent and treat nutrient deficiencies and ameliorate disease activity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease.

15325132|t|Method for measurement of the blood-brain barrier permeability in the perfused mouse brain: application to amyloid-beta peptide in wild type and Alzheimer's Tg2576 mice.
15325132|a|The role of transport exchanges of neuroactive solutes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is increasingly recognized. To take full advantage of genetically altered mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders for BBB transport studies, we adapted a brain perfusion technique to the mouse. During a carotid brain perfusion with a medium containing sheep red blood cells and mock plasma, the physiological parameters in the arterial inflow, regional cerebral blood flow (14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography), ultrastructural integrity of the tissue, barrier to lanthanum, brain water content, energy metabolites and lactate levels remain unchanged. Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) were iodinated by lactoperoxidase method. Non-oxidized mono-iodinated Abeta monomers were separated by HPLC (as confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry) and used in transport measurements. Transport of intact 125I-Abeta40 across the BBB was time- and concentration-dependent in contrast to negligible 14C-inulin uptake. In 5-6 months old Alzheimer's Tg2576 mice, Abeta40 BBB transport was increased by >eight-fold compared to age-matched littermate controls, and was mediated via the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts. We conclude the present arterial brain perfusion method provides strictly controlled environment in cerebral microcirculation suitable for examining transport of rapidly and slowly penetrating molecules across the BBB in normal and transgenic mice.

19457882|t|The management of infants and children treated with aciclovir for suspected viral encephalitis.
19457882|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate how infants and children with suspected viral encephalitis are currently managed in a UK tertiary children's hospital. METHODS: Case notes of all infants and children who received intravenous aciclovir for suspected encephalitis over a 6-month period were reviewed. Suspected viral encephalitis was defined as a child with fever or history of febrile illness and a reduced level of consciousness, irritability or a change in personality or behaviour or focal neurological signs. RESULTS: Fifty one children were identified. Two had proven herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV) and two had clinically diagnosed viral encephalitis with no cause identified. Forty children had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, but basic results were incomplete in 13 cases. CSF was sent for the detection of HSV DNA by PCR in 27 cases. The initial dose of aciclovir was incorrect in 38 cases. The median (range) length of intravenous aciclovir treatment was 4 (1-21) days. Six children were given a full course of aciclovir (10 or more days). For 14 children, there appeared to be no real indication for starting aciclovir. Case note documentation was generally inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: The management of children with suspected viral encephalitis appears haphazard in many cases. Guidelines for the management of children with suspected viral encephalitis are needed.

17559015|t|Emergency contraception in Cuba with 10 mg of mifepristone.
17559015|a|BACKGROUND: Mifepristone in a dose of 10 mg is an effective emergency contraceptive when administered up to 120 hours after unprotected coitus. METHODS: Between May 2003 and February 2005, we conducted in Cuba a single-arm trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 10 mg mifepristone for emergency contraception up to 6 days after unprotected coitus. A total of 635 women who requested emergency contraception after a single act of unprotected intercourse were included in the study. RESULTS: After treatment there were 7/635 (1.1%) pregnancies (95% CI 0.4-2.3%). Pregnancy that might have occurred was prevented in 88.0% of the cases (95% CI 77.1-95.1%). The most common side effects reported by participants were fatigue (10.7%), dizziness (6.1%) and nausea (4.9%); vomiting was only reported by 0.6%. In 38/635 (6.0%) women menstruation was delayed more than 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Mifepristone 10 mg administered is an effective emergency contraceptive with an acceptable profile of side effects up to five days, but greater studies are necessary to verify its efficacy up to 6 days after unprotected intercourse.

24918340|t|Intranasal insulin restores insulin signaling, increases synaptic proteins, and reduces Ab level and microglia activation in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice.
24918340|a|Decreased brain insulin signaling has been found recently in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intranasal administration of insulin, which delivers the drug directly into the brain, improves memory and cognition in both animal studies and small clinical trials. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we treated 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, a commonly used mouse model of AD, with daily intranasal administration of insulin for seven days and then studied brain abnormalities of the mice biochemically and immunohistochemically. We found that intranasal insulin restored insulin signaling, increased the levels of synaptic proteins, and reduced Ab40 level and microglia activation in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. However, this treatment did not affect the levels of glucose transporters and O-GlcNAcylation or tau phosphorylation. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of intranasal insulin treatment and support continuous clinical trials of intranasal insulin for the treatment of AD.

12711592|t|Intracellular calcium measurements as a method in studies on activity of purinergic P2X receptor channels.
12711592|a|Extracellular nucleotide-activated purinergic receptors (P2XRs) are a family of cation-permeable channels that conduct small cations, including Ca2+, leading to the depolarization of cells and subsequent stimulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in excitable cells. Here, we studied the spatiotemporal characteristics of intracellular Ca2+ signaling and its dependence on current signaling in excitable mouse immortalized gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting cells (GT1) and nonexcitable human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) cells expressing wild-type and chimeric P2XRs. In both cell types, P2XR generated depolarizing currents during the sustained ATP stimulation, which desensitized in order (from rapidly desensitizing to nondesensitizing): P2X3R > P2X2b + X4R > P2X2bR > P2X2a + X4R > P2X4R > P2X2aR > P2X7R. HEK-293 cells were not suitable for studies on P2XR-mediated Ca2+ influx because of the coactivation of endogenously expressed Ca2+-mobilizing purinergic P2Y receptors. However, when expressed in GT1 cells, all wild-type and chimeric P2XRs responded to agonist binding with global Ca2+ signals, which desensitized in the same order as current signals but in a significantly slower manner. The global distribution of Ca2+ signals was present independently of the rate of current desensitization. The temporal characteristics of Ca2+ signals were not affected by voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and removal of extracellular sodium. Ca2+ signals reflected well the receptor-specific EC50 values for ATP and the extracellular Zn2+ and pH sensitivities of P2XRs. These results indicate that intracellular Ca2+ measurements are useful for characterizing the pharmacological properties and messenger functions of P2XRs, as well as the kinetics of channel activity, when the host cells do not express other members of purinergic receptors.

15532930|a|Spatial repellency of a new multilayer paper strip impregnated with metofluthrin, a newly synthesized pyrethroid, was evaluated in the laboratory and in the field at Kerandangan, Lombok Island, Indonesia, with the use of cow- and human-baited double nets. Spatial repellency was observed in both cow- and human-baited collections. Metofluthrin treatment reduced mosquito collection by >80% during the 1st 4 weeks. However, repellency seemed to reduce with the loss of metofluthrin by evaporation within 6 wk after treatment.

20707784|t|Failure to improve cigarette smoking abstinence with transdermal selegiline + cognitive behavior therapy.
20707784|a|AIMS: To examine the effectiveness of transdermal selegiline for producing cigarette smoking abstinence. DESIGN: Adult smokers were randomly assigned to receive selegiline transdermal system (STS) or placebo given for 8 weeks. All participants received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Follow-ups were conducted at 25 and 52 weeks. SETTING: Community smoking cessation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 243 adult smokers (> or =18 years of age; > or =10 cigarettes/day). MEASURES: Expired-air carbon monoxide confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence. FINDINGS: STS was not superior to placebo. More women than men were abstinent at 52 week follow-up (28% vs 16%, P < 0.05). Behavioral activation (BAS) moderated treatment response (P = 0.01). The survival rate through week 52 for those with high 'drive' scores on the BAS was 47% if assigned to selegiline and 34% if assigned to placebo. The survival rate for those with low 'drive scores' on the BAS was 35% if assigned to selegiline compared to 53% if assigned to placebo. CONCLUSION: Transdermal selegiline does not appear generally effective in aiding smoking cessation though there may be a selective effect in those smokers with low 'behavioral activation'.

23836561|t|Detection of MRD may predict the outcome of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus chemotherapy.
23836561|a|From 2001 to 2011, 122 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with chemotherapy + imatinib (n = 54) or + dasatinib (n = 68). One hundred fifteen (94%) achieved complete remission (CR) including 101 patients who achieved it with only 1 induction course and had at least 1 minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment; 25 patients underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in first CR and were excluded, leaving 76 patients as the subject of this report. MRD monitoring by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at the end of induction and at ~3-month intervals thereafter. Median age was 54 years (range, 21-84 years). There was no difference in survival by achievement of at least a major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL/ABL < 0.1%) at CR (P = .22). Patients achieving MMR at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months had a better survival (P = .02, .04, .05, and .01, respectively). Negative MFC at CR did not predict for improved survival (P = .2). At 3 and 12 months, negative MRD by MFC was associated with improved survival (P = .04 and .001). MRD monitoring by PCR and MFC identifies patients who benefit from treatment intensification in first CR.

20572168|a|A detailed examination of [4+2] cycloaddition reactions between 1,8-disubstituted cyclooctatetraenes and diazo compounds revealed that 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-dione (PTAD) reacts to form either 2,3- or 3,4-disubstituted adducts. The product distribution can be controlled by modulating the electron density of the cyclooctatetraene. Unprecedented [4+2] cycloadditions between diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and 1,8-disubstituted cyclooctatetraenes are also described and further manipulation of a resulting cycloadduct uncovered a new pathway to the synthetically challenging bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene family. Variation of the substituents resulted in a range of compounds displaying selective action against different human tumour cell types.

15925386|t|Ethanol induces the production of cytokines via the Ca2+, MAP kinase, HIF-1alpha, and NF-kappaB pathway.
15925386|a|In the present study, we sought to investigate the signal transduction pathways of expression of cytokines in the ethanol-stimulated human mast cell line, HMC-1. Ethanol significantly increased the intracellular calcium level in HMC-1. Ethanol also significantly enhanced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta1 production compared with media control, but did not significantly affect the IL-1beta production. After 8 h of stimulation, ethanol increased mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in HMC-1. The increased cytokine level was significantly inhibited by BAPTA-AM, PD98059, and SB203580. These inhibitors also inhibited ethanol-induced ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Ethanol resulted in a great increase in protein levels and promoter activity driving luciferase expression of HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB in HMC-1 cells, but it did not affect on HIF-1alpha mRNA expression. Our observations show that calcium, MAPK activation, HIF-1alpha, and NF-kappaB are necessary for ethanol-induced TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 expression. These results may have important implications for the study of alcohol-related diseases.

11926722|t|Duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a double-blind clinical trial.
11926722|a|BACKGROUND: Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18-65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. (N = 33). Duloxetine dose was titrated in the first 3 weeks in a forced-titration regimen from 40 mg (20 mg b.i.d.) to 120 mg/day (60 mg b.i.d.). Patients were required to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness scale score of at least moderate severity (> or = 4) and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score of at least 15. Patients could not have had any current primary DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, or any anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis within the past year, excluding specific phobias. The primary efficacy measurement was the HAM-D-17 total score, and secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, CGI-Severity of Illness and CGI-Improvement, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes. RESULTS: Duloxetine was superior to placebo in change on the HAM-D-17 (p = .009). Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 64% and 56%, respectively, for duloxetine, compared with 52% and 30% for fluoxetine and 48% and 32% for placebo. Duloxetine was numerically superior to fluoxetine on the primary and most of the secondary outcome measures. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.

20594295|t|Circulating cytokines and procalcitonin in acute Q fever granulomatous hepatitis with poor response to antibiotic and short-course steroid therapy: a case report.
20594295|a|BACKGROUND: Q fever is a zoonosis distributed worldwide that is caused by Coxiella burnetii infection and the defervescence usually occurs within few days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Whether the changes of cytokine levels are associated with acute Q fever with persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy had not been investigated before. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of acute Q fever granulomatous hepatitis remained pyrexia despite several antibiotic therapy and 6-day course of oral prednisolone. During the 18-month follow-up, the investigation of the serum cytokines profile and procalcitonin (PCT) revealed that initially elevated levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-8, IL-10, and PCT decreased gradually, but the IL-6 remained in low titer. No evidence of chronic Q fever was identified by examinations of serum antibodies against C. burnetii and echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: The changes of cytokine levels may be associated with acute Q fever with poor response to treatment and PCT may be an indicator for monitoring the response to treatment.

8124790|t|Significance of arrhythmias during the first 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction treated with alteplase and effect of early administration of a beta-blocker or a bradycardiac agent on their incidence.
8124790|a|BACKGROUND: Although early intravenous beta-blocker therapy during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduces the incidence of fatal arrhythmias in patients not treated with thrombolytic agents, its antiarrhythmic effect in thrombolysed patients remains controversial. We investigated prospectively the arrhythmia incidence in 244 patients with AMI receiving alteplase and a double-blind randomized adjunctive therapy with intravenous atenolol, alinidine, or placebo. Moreover, the characteristics and prognostic significance of early arrhythmias and their relation with infarct size and coronary patency were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring on day 1 and were clinically followed in the hospital for 10 to 14 days. Coronary angiography was performed on day 10 to 14. Atenolol and alinidine significantly decreased the basic heart rate without causing more sinus arrest or higher-degree atrioventricular block. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in alinidine patients was lower than in the atenolol patients (P = .007) but not lower than in placebo patients (P = .11). There was no effect of either agent on the incidence and frequency distribution of ventricular or supraventricular premature beats or on the incidence and characteristics of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or ventricular fibrillation (VF). On day 1, seven VF episodes were recorded in six patients (2.5%) and five VT episodes in five patients (2%). VF always started at < 2.5 hours after start of thrombolytic treatment and VT always at > 2.5 hours (average of 6 hours). Five of the seven VF and three of the five VT episodes started with an R-on-T. However, for all VT, the morphology of the first beat was the same as that of the following beats, suggesting that the sustained arrhythmia was not induced by an extrasystole. After day 1 and before hospital discharge, VF and VT developed in one and six patients, respectively. Three of the seven patients who developed VF during the first 2 weeks underwent coronary angiography; all three had an occluded infarct-related artery. In contrast, only one of nine patients with early or late VT had an occluded vessel. Patients with VT and VF on day 1 had a significantly larger enzymatic infarct size than those without the arrhythmia (P = .02), and a similar trend was noted for VT or VF after day 1 (P = .19). However, none of the patients with VT or VF on day 1 developed a life-threatening arrhythmia later during the hospital stay. Also, none of the seven patients with VT or VF after day 1 had experienced a major rhythm disturbance during the first 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Our data do not support the hypothesis that beta-blockers or bradycardiac agents might reduce the incidence of major arrhythmias when used in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy. (2) The pathogeneses of VT and VF early during AMI are clearly distinct. (3) VT or VF during the first 2 weeks is a marker for a larger infarct. (4) We could not detect a relation between malignant arrhythmias on day 1 and recurrences within the following 2 weeks.

11444085|t|Maintenance of body weight, physical activity and calcium intake helps preserve bone mass in elderly women.
11444085|a|This prospective study focused on lifestyle factors and weight maintenance that may modulate the rate of bone loss at the weight-bearing proximal femur and non-weight-bearing distal radius in elderly women. Altogether 128 women of 134 subjects participated in this study with a mean follow-up time 3.9 years (range 2.9-5.3 years). The initially 60- to 65-year-old subjects were originally selected by their level of physical activity [high (PA+) and low (PA-)] and calcium intake [high (Ca+) and low (Ca-)], and the original groups were maintained in this study. Physical fitness and bone mineral content (BMC) decreased significantly at a similar rate in all four study groups without any statistically significant between-group difference. The mean change in the muscle strength of leg extensors was -3.3% (95% CI -5% to -1.5%) at follow-up when including all individuals. The leg extension strength was still 9.2% (95% CI 2.7% to 16.1%) better in the PA+ groups compared with PA- groups at follow-up. The mean change in the forearm flexion strength was -14% (95% CI -16.5% to -11.3%) at follow-up with no difference in the strength level between PA+ and PA- groups. The mean change in the estimated oxygen uptake was -3.4% (95% CI -5.6% to -1.1%) at follow-up. The PA+ groups were still fitter, the between-group difference in the estimated oxygen uptake being 11.9% (95% CI 4.8% to 19.5%). The mean changes in BMC at follow-up were -2.1% (95% CI -3.0% to -1.2%) at the femoral neck, -1.9% (95% CI -3.2% to -0.5%) at the trochanter, and -12.4% (95% CI -15.4% to -9.4%) at the distal radius, indicating mean annual losses of 0.6% (95% CI 0.3% to 0.8%), 0.5% (95% CI 0.1% to 0.8%), and 3.2% (95% CI 2.4% to 4.0%), respectively. Decreased body weight was associated with higher bone loss in all measured bone sites. High calcium intake and better preservation of physical fitness were associated with a smaller decrease in femoral neck BMC.

20960528|t|Activity and safety of dose-adjusted infusional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy with rituximab in very elderly patients with poor-prognostic untreated diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
20960528|a|BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the activity and safety of dose-adjusted infusional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy with rituximab (DA-POCH-R) in elderly patients with poor-prognostic untreated diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: From April 2006 to November 2009, 23 patients, aged >= 70 years, with an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 2 or 3, were enrolled. Only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% were allowed. The DA-POCH-R regimen was administered every 3 weeks for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 8 cycles. RESULTS: Median patient age was 77 years (range, 70-90 years); 83% of patients had Ann Arbor stage III to IV disease. Median LVEF at baseline was 62%. Four (17%) patients had a history of abnormal cardiovascular conditions. Twenty-one (91%) patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 90%, with a complete response rate of 57%. The 3-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 56% and 54%, respectively. Neutropenia (48%) was the most frequent grade 3 to 4 adverse event (AE); no grade 3 to 4 cardiac AEs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: DA-POCH-R was an active and safe combination therapy for patients aged >= 70 years with poor-prognostic untreated DLBCL. This regimen was a reasonable alternative for elderly patients who were not considered to tolerate standard R-CHOP treatment.

17426890|t|Treatment of human acute schistosomiasis with oxamniquine induces an increase in interferon-gamma response to Schistosoma mansoni antigens.
17426890|a|Patients with acute schistosomiasis were studied before and after oxamniquine treatment. They had been exposed to cercariae 5 to 9 weeks before, and presented compatible clinical manifestations, eosinophilia, and high levels of total IgE. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 were measured by ELISA in whole blood samples under soluble egg antigen or soluble adult worm preparation stimulation. After treatment, the reduction of leukocytosis and eosinophilia were not significant, but total IgE levels decreased significantly, in contrast to IFN-gamma levels that were significantly increased. The oxamniquine treatment of acute schistosomiasis patients is followed by an improvement of a Th1 response in vitro. If this response has a protective aspect is unknown, and some investigations need to be realized.

16620369|t|Sildenafil citrate use and the incidence of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
16620369|a|Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) has been reported rarely in men after taking sildenafil or other phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction (ED). The incidence of NAION in men receiving sildenafil treatment for ED was estimated using pooled safety data from global clinical trials and European observational studies. Based on clinical trial data in more than 13,000 men and on more than 35,000 patient-years of observation in epidemiologic studies, we estimated an incidence of 2.8 cases of NAION per 100,000 patient-years of sildenafil exposure. This is similar to estimates reported in general US population samples (2.52 and 11.8 cases per 100,000 men aged >or=50 years). The data cited herein do not suggest an increased incidence of NAION in men who took sildenafil for ED.

12404677|t|Ecstasy/MDMA attributed problems reported by novice, moderate and heavy recreational users.
12404677|a|RATIONALE: The recreational use of MDMA/Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is associated with many psychobiological problems, but there is a paucity of data on how these relate to the level of past use. OBJECTIVES: to assess the incidence of Ecstasy-attributed problems as reported by novice, moderate and heavy users. METHODS: 763 unpaid volunteers took part in a WWW study of recreational drug use. This report is based on the 282 Ecstasy users from that sample, who comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy users (+100 occasions). Yes/no responses were automatically recorded to a series of questions covering psychobiological problems experienced when drug-free, which were attributed by the respondents to their Ecstasy use. RESULTS: Depression, memory problems, anxiety, mood fluctuation, poor concentration, infections, tremors/twitches and weight loss, were all significantly associated with the extent of Ecstasy use. Thus memory problems attributed to Ecstasy were reported by 19% of novice users, 52% of heavy users and 73% of heavy users (chi-square 42.74, df=2, p<0.001); many of the other variables showed similar trends. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of problems attributed to Ecstasy use, is directly related to the number of occasions it has been used.

19890203|t|The protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir does not decrease insulin secretion in healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers.
19890203|a|BACKGROUND: HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to worsen glucose and lipid metabolism. Recent studies have suggested that protease inhibitors can impair insulin secretion in HIV-infected patients. We studied the effects of the protease inhibitor combination lopinavir and ritonavir on insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism in HIV-negative persons. METHODS: A combination dose of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg was given twice daily to eight HIV-seronegative men for 4 weeks. Fasting glucose, insulin, lipid, and lipoprotein profiles; oral glucose tolerance; insulin secretion and insulin-mediated glucose disposal by hyperglycemic clamp; and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were determined before and after lopinavir/ritonavir administration. RESULTS: There was no change in first-phase insulin secretion (2.82 +/- 0.30 versus 2.71 +/- 0.31 nmol/l; P = 0.60), as well as fasting insulin and glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance, or insulin-mediated glucose disposal after 4 weeks administration of lopinavir/ritonavir. However, there were significant increases in fasting triglycerides (1.02 +/- 0.13 versus 2.20 +/- 0.31 mmol/l; P = 0.001), total cholesterol (4.42 +/- 0.30 versus 5.70 +/- 0.60 mmol/l; P = 0.007), and apo B-100 levels (0.86 +/- 0.07 versus 1.07 +/- 0.11 g/l; P = 0.0009). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (0.99 +/- 0.11 versus 0.82 +/- 0.10 mmol/l; P = 0.005). There were no changes in body composition, weight, or body fat. CONCLUSION: Although administration of lopinavir/ritonavir to healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers for 4 weeks resulted in increased triglyceride and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, there was no change in first-phase insulin secretion during the hyperglycemic clamp. The reported effects of protease inhibitor on insulin secretion in HIV-infected individuals may be due to changes in HIV-related factors and not a direct drug effect.

21147712|t|A combination of iron and retinol supplementation benefits iron status, IL-2 level and lymphocyte proliferation in anemic pregnant women.
21147712|a|BACKGROUND: Iron and vitamin A deficiencies impact anemia and the immune system. OBJECTIVE: to investigate the effect of iron combined with retinol supplementation on iron status, IL-2 level and lymphocyte proliferation. METHODS: a double-blind randomized trial conducted over 2 months. We randomly allocated 186 anemic pregnant women with 80  <= Hb 0 < 110 g/L into four groups. Group I (n=47) was supplemented daily with 60 mg iron as ferrous sulfate, IF (n=46) with 60 mg iron and 0.4 mg folic acid, IR (n=46) with 60 mg iron, 2.0 mg retinol and 0.4 mg folic acid and C (n=47) was the placebo group,. RESULTS: after the 2 months trial, there were considerable increases of iron status in Hb, plasma iron and ferritin in the I, IF and IR groups compared with Group C. Increases in plasma iron and ferritin in the IR group were also significantly greater than in Groups I and IF. Compared with group C, increases of IL-2 levels were 119, 184 and 206 ng/L; and lymphocyte proliferation increased by 0.095, 0.112 and 0.219 in Groups I, IF and IR, respectively. Increases of IL-2 were 65.3 ng/L and 87.5 ng/L in Groups IF and IR, greater than in Group I (both p values <0.01); and lymphocyte proliferation in Group IR were 0.124 and 0.107, also greater than in Groups I and IF, respectively. CONCLUSION: iron combined retinol supplementation was more beneficial to improving iron status and lymphocyte proliferation during pregnancy than iron alone.

8737600|t|The effects of tert-butyl hydroperoxide on human erythrocyte membrane ion transport and the protective actions of antioxidants.
8737600|a|The oxidising actions of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH) (0-3 mmol/l) on human erythrocyte membrane ion transport have been studied using measurements of 86Rb+ influx. Ouabain and bumetanide were used to distinguish Rb+ flux via the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase), Na,K,2Cl cotransporter and through residual membrane permeability. The protective actions of antioxidants and related molecules (vitamin E, vitamin E acetate, Trolox, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and dithioerythritol (DTE) were studied. The effects of tBH were concentration dependent and the mean residual (ouabain and bumetanide insensitive) Rb+ permeability was increased by a factor of 8.5 (S.E.M. 2.2, n = 15) by a 5-min exposure to 2 mmol/l tBH. This action was almost completely prevented by co-incubation with Trolox or BHT, and partially prevented by the presence of vitamin E or DTE. Incubation with 2 mmol/l tBH for 5 min increased intracellular Na+ by a factor of 1.8 (S.E.M. 0.1, n = 8) and reduced intracellular K+ by a factor of 0.93 (S.E.M. 0.03, n = 8). These effects were prevented by Trolox and partially prevented by vitamin E, whereas DTE and vitamin E acetate were ineffective. Incubation with 2 mmol/l tBH for 5 min reduced the mean apparent sodium pump Vmax by 43% (S.E.M. 4, n = 8). This effect was completely prevented by Trolox and partially prevented by vitamin E. Vitamin E acetate had no effect. The mean bumetanide-sensitive Rb+ influx via the Na,K,2Cl cotransporter was reduced by 30% (S.E.M. 8.7, n = 25) by a 5-min exposure to 2 mmol/l tBH. This action was variable and no significant actions of the antioxidants studied could be demonstrated. This study suggests that tBH-mediated oxidative damage occurs from a hydrophilic site and involves increased non-selective membrane cation permeability and inhibition of specific transport systems.

8212978|t|Combination of oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
8212978|a|Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) appears to be an heterogeneous disorder characterized by both relative insulin deficiency and impaired insulin action. The initial management of NIDDM should include patient education, dietary counselling and individualized programs of physical activity. It is only when such measures fail that drug therapy should be considered. Oral drug therapies include sulphonylurea derivatives, biguanides, among which metformin remains the only one commercialized in our country, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose. However, insulin therapy may be required to achieve adequate glycaemic control in some patients, the so-called secondary failures to oral treatment. The rationale for combining insulin and oral drug therapy derives from a better understanding of the pathophysiology of NIDDM and of the mechanisms of action of the oral drugs available: 1) type 2 diabetic patients are both insulin-deficient and insulin-resistant, thus requiring quite high doses of exogenous insulin; 2) peripheral insulin delivery leads to hyperinsulinaemia which could play a role in the pathogenesis of late diabetic complications; 3) sulphonylureas stimulate insulin release directly into the portal vein and could also potentiate peripheral insulin action; and 4) metformin (by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates and sucrose) are able to reduce the amounts of insulin needed to control postprandial hyperglycaemia. Numerous studies have shown that a combination of insulin and sulphonylurea is more effective than insulin alone in the treatment of patients with NIDDM after secondary failure to oral drugs, leading to better glucose profiles and/or decreased insulin needs. The available data suggest that combination therapy is most beneficial in the diabetic patient who still has residual insulin secretory capacity and that the best scheme comprises an evening injection of lente insulin and the administration of sulphonylureas before meals. Preliminary results suggested that insulin-metformin (when obesity is present) or insulin-acarbose (when post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurs) combinations might offer some favourable features for the treatment of NIDDM patients although these therapeutical approaches still require adequate evaluation in further controlled studies. The additional cost of such combined therapy should be weighed against the potential advantages of better metabolic control.

20536462|t|Thymalfasin in the treatment of hepatitis B and C.
20536462|a|Thymalfasin exhibited an immunomodulatory and a direct antiviral mechanism of action. The low rate of sustained response of chronic hepatitis with current therapies, underscores the need for new therapeutic options. It has been suggested that thymalfasin may have efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C. Pilots studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with thymalfasin in combination with interferon or nucleoside analogue, showed a 70% complete sustained response rate. Studies in chronic hepatitis C patients, would indicate that thymalfasin in combination with standard or pegylated interferon with ribavirin may improve response rate in hepatitis C virus (HCV) naÃ¯ve and nonresponder patients. However, a large phase-III randomized study conducted in Europe in HCV patients nonresponder to Peg-interferon with ribavirin, demonstrated that thymalfasin did not improve the rate of sustained virologic responses, but, in patients who completed therapy, thymalfasin significantly diminished the relapse rate. In conclusion, thymalfasin, in combination with the standard of care, may be helpful as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C.

21802143|t|Hepatic drug interaction between tacrolimus and lansoprazole in a bone marrow transplant patient receiving voriconazole and harboring CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 heterozygous mutations.
21802143|a|BACKGROUND: A drug interaction between oral tacrolimus (TAC) and lansoprazole (LAN) has been reported in patients with CYP2C19 hetero/homozygous mutations and the CYP3A5 *3/*3 genotype. A PubMed search (implemented March 16, 2011) using search terms drug interaction, tacrolimus, and lansoprazole failed to identify drug interactions in CYP3A5 extensive metabolizers and parenterally administered TAC. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report a case of drug interaction between intravenously administered TAC and LAN in a patient being treated with voriconazole (VCZ) and harboring CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 heterozygous mutations. CASE SUMMARY: An 18-year-old Japanese man weighing 53 kg with an anaplastic large cell lymphoma received continuous IV administration of TAC as post-transplantation prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He began receiving IV LAN 60 mg/d and VCZ 400 mg/d initiated the day before BMT. His blood TAC concentrations were within the range of 9-16 ng/mL from post-BMT day 5 to 26. The engraftment of the donor's hematopoietic cells was observed on day 17. The LAN dose was reduced to 15 mg/d PO on day 26, and the blood TAC concentration subsequently decreased to 6.6 ng/mL, with GVHD-related symptoms emerging on day 28. Consequently, the plasma VCZ concentration also decreased from 5.0 ng/mL to 2.5 ng/mL after reducing the LAN dose. VCZ was switched to liposomal amphotericin B on day 48. Thereafter, the blood TAC concentration decreased to 4.4 ng/mL on day 51. Ultimately, the patient died on day 77 because of the recurrence and progression of lymphoma. Other drugs taken were acyclovir, ursodeoxycholic acid, cefepime, meropenem, vancomycin, lenograstim, and dopamine hydrochloride. The genotyping analyses using the pre-BMT and post-engraftment (day 33) samples indicated that both were CYP2C19 *1/*2, CYP3A5 *1/*3 and CYP2C9 *1/*1. The calculated Drug Interaction Probability Score between TAC and LAN was 6, indicating a probable interaction. TAC and VCZ concentrations were measured by an affinity column-mediated immunometric assay and HPLC, respectively. Mutant alleles were examined using the multiplex extension of unlabeled oligonucleotide primers with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates. CONCLUSIONS: In a BMT patient with CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 heterozygous mutations, blood TAC concentration decreased after reducing the LAN dose, which appeared to be caused by a reduction in plasma VCZ concentration.

17163004|t|Immunomodulation. Part IV: Glutamine.
17163004|a|Glutamine, a nonessential amino acid that appears to be conditionally essential during periods of physiologic stress, plays important physiologic roles in the immune system. However, neither enteral nor parenteral glutamine supplementation makes a difference in the rate of systemic infection or of NEC in very low birth weight infants. Thus, the search for agents to enhance the neonate's immune system and to serve as safe and effective adjuvants to antibiotics continues. Part V, the final article in this immunomodulation series, will explore the use of probiotics to support the neonatal immune system.

23216643|t|Inhibitory effect of the combination therapy of simvastatin and pinocembrin on atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice.
23216643|a|The present study was performed to investigate the effects of the combination therapy of pinocembrin and simvastatin on the atherosclerotic lesions development in the ApoE-/- mice. METHODS: Eight-week-old male ApoE-/- mice were fed high fat diet (HFD) and treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg per day), pinocembrin (20 mg/kg per day), or the combination therapy (simvastatin 5 mg/kg per day and pinocembrin 20 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks. The serum lipid levels, nitric oxide (NO), endothelin (ET), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined with spectrophotometric measurement and ELISA assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum and aortic root was detected. En face analyses of atherosclerotic lesion in whole aorta and aortic root sections were performed with plaque staining using oil red O. RESULTS: The combination treatment with simvastatin and pinocembrin resulted in significantly decreased levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, augmented NO levels and SOD activity, inhibited ET and VEGF expression. Immunohistochemistry of aortic valve sections revealed that the combination therapy also suppressed the expression of VEGF induced by HFD. In addition, HFD-induced arterial wall lipid disposition displayed by oil red O staining was reduced significantly in aortic root and whole aorta en face in the combination administrated mice. The effect of the combination was superior to simvastatin alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of simvastatin and pinocembrin synergistically inhibited atherosclerotic lesion development in ApoE-/- mice with hyperlipidemia, which is partially dependent on the protective of vascular endothelium.

11605920|t|Effect of direct fetal opioid analgesia on fetal hormonal and hemodynamic stress response to intrauterine needling.
11605920|a|BACKGROUND: Whether the fetus can experience pain remains controversial. During the last half of pregnancy, the neuroanatomic connections for nociception are in place, and the human fetus mounts sizable stress responses to physical insults. Analgesia has been recommended for intrauterine procedures or late termination, but without evidence that it works. The authors investigated whether fentanyl ablates the fetal stress response to needling using the model of delayed interval sampling during intrahepatic vein blood sampling and transfusion in alloimmunized fetuses undergoing intravascular transfusion between 20 and 35 weeks. METHODS: Intravenous fentanyl (10 microg/kg estimated fetal weight x 1.25 placental correction) was given once at intrahepatic vein transfusion in 16 fetuses, and changes (posttransfusion - pretransfusion) in beta endorphin, cortisol, and middle cerebral artery pulsatility index were compared with intrahepatic vein transfusions without fentanyl and with control transfusions at the placental cord insertion. RESULTS: Fentanyl reduced the beta endorphin (mean difference in changes, -70.3 pg/ml; 95% confidence interval, -121 to -19.2; P = 0.02) and middle cerebral artery pulsatility index response (mean difference, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.04; P = 0.03), but not the cortisol response (mean difference, -10.9 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval, -24.7 to 2.9; P = 0.11) in fetuses who had paired intrahepatic vein transfusions with and without fentanyl. Comparison with control fetuses transfused without fentanyl indicated that the beta endorphin and cerebral Doppler response to intrahepatic vein transfusion with fentanyl approached that of nonstressful placental cord transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that intravenous fentanyl attenuates the fetal stress response to intrahepatic vein needling.

20578474|t|Predictions of gas-particle partitioning coefficients (K(P)) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at various occupational environments of Songkhla Province, Thailand.
20578474|a|Ambient air samples were collected over periods of 24 hours and 3 hours using a Graseby-Anderson high volume air sampler with PM10 TE-6001 at 15 sampling sites, including an urban residential zone, rural area, industrial factories, waste incinerator, traffic areas and agricultural burning areas in Songkhla Province, Thailand. An analysis of organic carbon and elemental carbon was conducted to estimate the gas-particle partitioning of PAHs using a model proposed by Dachs-Eisenreich. The estimated LogK(P) of PAHs emphasized the risk for lung cancer among outdoor workers in waste incinerators, traffic intersections and bus terminals, suggesting the role of the carbonaceous fraction over the gas-particle partitioning of PAHs. Analysis of f(SC)K(SA)delta(OCT)/F(OM)K(OA) ratios revealed a significant role of adsorption and absorption in unusually high elemental carbon fractions (ie low OC/EC ratio) in fine particles collected at waste incinerators and the abnormally high organic carbon fractions (ie high OC/EC ratio) observed in those fine particles of an urban residential zone, respectively. The dual mode of ab/adsorption tended to dominate the gas-particle partitioning of LMW PAHs collected at the traffic intersections and bus terminal.

14714760|a|We have reported previously that purine methylenecyclopropane analogs are potent agents against cytomegaloviruses. In an attempt to extend the activity of these compounds, the 2-amino-6-cyclopropylaminopurine analog, QYL-1064, was selected for further study by modifying the purine 6 substituent. A total of 22 analogs were tested against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). Ten of the analogs had activity against at least one of the viruses tested. One compound had moderate activity against HSV-1 and six had activity against VZV. All but one compound was active against HCMV with a mean EC50 of 2.1 +/- 0.6 microM, compared with a mean EC50 of 3.9 +/- 0.8 microM for ganciclovir. Of special interest was the fact that eight of the ten compounds were active against both HHV-6A and HHV-6B with mean EC50 values of 6.0 +/- 5.2 mciroM and <2.4 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. Only two compounds had activity against EBV, whereas all but one compound was active against HHV-8 with a mean EC50 of 3.1 +/- 1.7 microM. These results indicate that members of this series of methylenecyclopropane analogs are highly active against HCMV, HHV-6, and HHV-8 but are less active against HSV, VZV, and EBV.

2109002|t|Effects of prostacyclin on bronchoconstriction and neutropenia induced by inhaled platelet-activating factor in man.
2109002|a|We studied the effects of prostacyclin (PGI2) on the airway responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a randomized and crossover study in eight normal subjects. PGI2 or diluent (glycine buffer) was continuously infused on 2 separate days. Two breaths of PAF (21 micrograms) were inhaled three times every 15 minutes and airflow at 30% of vital capacity from partial flow-volume curves (Vp30) was measured. PGI2 (4 ng/kg/min) had no effect on Vp30 or blood pressure, whereas heart rate increased from 70.3 +/- 3.9 to 73.7 +/- 4.0 beats/min (mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01). Two subjects did not complete the study because of transient hypotension. PGI2 had no effect on PAF-induced bronchoconstriction with maximal decreases in Vp30 of 42.0 +/- 8.0% (p less than 0.01) during PGI2 and 49.8 +/- 14.2% (p less than 0.02) during diluent infusion. Ex vivo platelet aggregation to PAF (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) was significantly inhibited by PGI2. Circulating neutrophils decreased from 4.7 +/- 0.9 x 10(9)/L to 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(9)/L (p less than 0.05) 5 minutes after the first PAF inhalation during diluent infusion, whereas there was no significant change with PGI2. Thus, PGI2 does not influence PAF-induced bronchoconstriction in man despite causing marked inhibition of ex vivo PAF-induced platelet aggregation and preventing the fall of neutrophils.

22564132|t|Patent ductus arteriosus in premature neonates.
22564132|a|Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. In infants born prior to 28 weeks of gestation, a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can cause cardiovascular instability, exacerbate respiratory distress syndrome, prolong the need for assisted ventilation and increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, renal dysfunction, cerebral palsy and mortality. We review the pathophysiology, clinical features and assessment of haemodynamic significance, and provide a rigorous appraisal of the quality of evidence to support current medical and surgical management of PDA of prematurity. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin and ibuprofen remain the mainstay of medical therapy for PDA, and can be used both for prophylaxis as well as for rescue therapy to achieve PDA closure. Surgical ligation is also effective and is used in infants who do not respond to medical management. Although both medical and surgical treatment have proven efficacy in closing the ductus, both modalities are associated with significant adverse effects. Because the ductus does undergo spontaneous closure in some premature infants, improved and early identification of infants most likely to develop a symptomatic PDA could help in directing treatment to the at-risk infants and allow others to receive expectant management.

8112370|t|Effect of entacapone, a COMT inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and on cardiovascular responses in patients with Parkinson's disease.
8112370|a|In an open, randomised, cross-over study we investigated the effect of a single 200 mg oral dose of entacapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of levodopa/carbidopa, and on the cardiovascular responses (blood pressure and pulse rate variation to standard stimuli) in eight parkinsonian patients. Entacapone significantly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of levodopa by 46%, from 3620 to 5280 h.ng.ml-1 and prolonged its elimination half-life (t1/2el) from 1.5 h to 2.0 h. The mean AUC of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the monoamine oxidase-dependent metabolite of levodopa, was significantly increased from 122 to 343 h.micrograms.ml-1 by entacapone. A small decrease in the AUC of homovanillic acid (HVA), the COMT dependent metabolite of levodopa, was observed (from 455 to 303 h.ng.ml-1). Entacapone also decreased the excretion of HVA but not that of 3-methoxytyramine in the urine. Cardiovascular autonomic responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli were not changed by entacapone. We conclude that a single dose of entacapone moderately increases the AUC and prolongs the t1/2el of levodopa in man and that that does not affect cardiovascular autonomic regulation.

21844836|t|Low risk for hepatitis C seroconversion in methadone maintenance treatment.
21844836|a|OBJECTIVES: To study the risk factors for seroconversion to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since admission to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and to characterize the seronegative admitted group. METHODS: All 657 patients admitted to our MMT clinic in Tel Aviv, Israel, between 1993 and 2008 were prospectively followed up. Those who were HCV negative (n = 271) with >1 HCV tests (n = 207) were included for seroconversion analyses. RESULTS: Proportions of ever drug injectors, benzodiazepine abuse, and former USSR immigrants were higher among HCV sera-positive versus sera-negative patients on admission to MMT. The incidence of HCV seroconversion in MMT was 2/100 person years [py] (25 seroconversions, 1133.9 py). Seroconversion rates were higher among 44 younger patients (<30 years: 9.6/100 vs 1.4/100 py, P < 0.0005), among 103 patients with positive urine results to benzodiazepines (3.6/100 vs 1/100 py, P = 0.005), among 118 patients who injected the drugs (3.9/100 vs 1/100 py, P = 0.003), and among 43 patients who dropped out and were readmitted to the MMT (4.3/100 vs 1.7/100 py, P = 0.04). There was a trend of higher seroconversion among 61 females (P = 0.1), among 62 patients with no children (P = 0.1), and among those having hepatitis B antigen (n = 7; P = 0.09). Variables that predicted seroconversion were drug injection, benzodiazepine abuse, and being younger at admission to MMT. Being a former USSR immigrant did not predict seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: The HCV seroconversion rate of patients in MMT is low, also, for former USSR immigrants. The predictors for seroconversion were only admission variables (younger age at admission to MMT, ever drug injector, and having positive urine to benzodiazepines at MMT admission). Specific intervention to eliminate seroconversion is needed for these high-risk groups.

15119918|t|Somatic symptoms as predictors of time to onset of response to fluoxetine in major depressive disorder.
15119918|a|OBJECTIVE: In the present study we assessed the relationship between somatic symptoms and the time to onset of clinical response to fluoxetine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: 87 outpatients (mean age = 41.4 +/- 10.2 years; 59.8% women) with DSM-III-R MDD who had sustained acute response to fluoxetine completed the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) at baseline. Onset of response was defined as a 30% decrease in the total score for the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression that led to a 50% decrease by week 8. With the use of 2 separate multiple regressions, controlling for the severity of depression at baseline, we then assessed the relationship between the number of somatic symptoms as assessed by the SQ subscale for somatic symptoms (SQ-SS) and both the time to onset of clinical response and the time to clinical response. The study was conducted between November 1992 and January 1999. RESULTS: A greater number of somatic symptoms at baseline predicted a greater amount of time to onset of clinical response to fluoxetine (p =.0233). The relationship between SQ-SS scores and time to response was not found to be statistically significant (p >.05). CONCLUSION: Somatic symptoms of depression were found to be associated with a delayed onset of antidepressant response to fluoxetine in MDD.

20804632|t|Factors influencing the vitamin D status of 10-year-old urban South African children.
20804632|a|OBJECTIVE: Assessment of vitamin D status in a cohort of healthy 10-year-old urban children and the factors that influence vitamin D status in these children. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected across four seasons of the year for the biochemical determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Anthropometric measurements (height and weight), BMI and total fat and lean mass (determined by the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. 25(OH)D concentrations were assessed by chemiluminescent assay. SETTING: Study of children in the Greater Johannesburg area of South Africa who form the Bone Health sub-cohort of the longitudinal Birth to Twenty cohort. SUBJECTS: Three hundred and eighty-five children who form the Bone Health sub-cohort of the longitudinal Birth to Twenty cohort. RESULTS: White children had significantly higher 25(OH)D than their black peers (120 ·0 (sd 36 ·6) nmol/l v. 93 ·3 (sd 34 ·0) nmol/l, respectively). Seasonal variations in 25(OH)D levels were found only in white children, with 25(OH)D levels being significantly higher in white than in black children during the autumn and summer months. In multiple regression analysis, season, ethnicity, sex and total fat mass were the factors found to have an influence on 25(OH)D. Vitamin D deficiency (7 %) and insufficiency (19 %) were uncommon among the 10-year-old children. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation or fortification is not warranted in healthy children living in Johannesburg. However, further studies need to confirm this in other regions of the country, especially in those living further south and with less sunshine during the winter months.

19847865|t|Randomized clinical trial of the effect of glucocorticoids on peritoneal inflammation and postoperative recovery after colectomy.
19847865|a|BACKGROUND: Recent data have suggested a relationship between postoperative fatigue and the peritoneal cytokine response after surgery. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that preoperative administration of glucocorticoids before surgery would decrease fatigue and enhance recovery, by reducing the peritoneal production of cytokines. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized controlled study, patients undergoing elective, open colonic resection were administered 8 mg dexamethasone or normal saline. Patients were treated within an enhanced recovery after surgery programme. Primary outcomes were cytokine levels in peritoneal drain fluid and fatigue as measured by the Identity-Consequence Fatigue Scale (ICFS). RESULTS: Baseline parameters were similar for 29 patients in the dexamethasone group and 31 in the placebo group. Patients who received dexamethasone had lower ICFS scores on days 3 and 7. Dexamethasone was associated with significantly lower peritoneal fluid interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-13 concentrations on day 1, and these correlated with changes in the ICFS score. There was no significant increase in adverse events in the dexamethasone group. CONCLUSION: Preoperative administration of dexamethasone resulted in a significant reduction in early postoperative fatigue, associated with an attenuated early peritoneal cytokine response. Peritoneal production of cytokines may therefore be important in postoperative recovery. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12607000066482 (http://www.anzctr.org.au/).

21084834|t|Inhibition of Cot1/Tlp2 oncogene in AML cells reduces ERK5 activation and up-regulates p27Kip1 concomitant with enhancement of differentiation and cell cycle arrest induced by silibinin and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3).
21084834|a|Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by dysregulated cell proliferation associated with impaired cell differentiation, and current treatment regimens rarely save the patient. Thus, new mechanism-based approaches are needed to improve prognosis of this disease. We have investigated in preclinical studies the potential anti-leukemia use of the plant-derived polyphenol Silibinin (SIL) in combination with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). Although most of the leukemic blasts ex vivo responded by differentiation to treatment with this combination, the reasons for the absence of SIL-1,25D synergy in some cases were unclear. Here we report that failure of SIL to enhance the action of 1,25D is likely due to the SIL-induced increase in the activity of differentiation-antagonizing cell components, such as ERK5. This kinase is under the control of Cot1/Tlp2, and inhibition of Cot1 activity by a specific pharmacological inhibitor 4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-(pyridin-3-yl-methylamino-3-cyano-[1-7]-naphthyridine, or by Cot1 siRNA, increases the differentiation by SIL/1,25D combinations. Conversely, over-expression of a Cot1 construct increases the cellular levels of P-ERK5, and SIL/1,25D-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest are diminished. It appears that reduction in ERK5 activity by inhibition of Cot1 allows SIL to augment the expression of 1,25D-induced differentiation promoting factors and cell cycle regulators such as p27 (Kip1) , which leads to cell cycle arrest. This study shows that in some cell contexts SIL/1,25D can promote expression of both differentiation-promoting and differentiation-inhibiting genes, and that the latter can be neutralized by a highly specific pharmacological inhibitor, suggesting a potential for supplementing treatment of AML with this combination of agents.

21596528|t|In vitro activity of BAL30072 against Burkholderia pseudomallei.
21596528|a|Burkholderia pseudomallei is an intrinsically antibiotic-resistant Category B priority pathogen and the aetiological agent of melioidosis. Treatment of B. pseudomallei infection is biphasic and lengthy in order to combat the acute and chronic phases of the disease. Acute-phase treatment preferably involves an intravenous cephalosporin (ceftazidime) or a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem). In this study, the anti-B. pseudomallei efficacy of a new monosulfactam, BAL30072, was tested against laboratory strains 1026b and 1710b and several isogenic mutant derivatives as well as a collection of clinical and environmental B. pseudomallei strains from Thailand. More than 93% of the isolates had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range 0.004-0.016 µg/mL. For the laboratory strain 1026b, the MIC of BAL30072 was 0.008 µg/mL, comparable with the MICs of 1.5 µg/mL for ceftazidime, 0.5 µg/mL for imipenem and 1 µg/mL for meropenem. Time-kill curves revealed that BAL30072 was rapidly bactericidal, killing >99% of bacteria in 2 h. BAL30072 activity was not significantly affected by efflux, it was only a marginal substrate of PenA b-lactamase, and activity was independent of malleobactin production and transport and the ability to transport pyochelin. In summary, BAL30072 has superior in vitro activity against B. pseudomallei compared with ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem and it is rapidly bactericidal.

24135893|t|Roflumilast for the treatment of COPD in an Asian population: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study.
24135893|a|BACKGROUND: Roflumilast is the only oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor indicated for use in the treatment of COPD. Previous studies of roflumilast have predominantly involved European and North American populations. A large study was necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of roflumilast in a predominantly ethnic Chinese population. METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 study, patients of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicity (N = 626) with severe to very severe COPD were randomized 1:1 to receive either roflumilast 500 µg once daily or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was change in prebronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to study end. RESULTS: Three hundred thirteen patients were assigned to each treatment. Roflumilast provided a sustained increase over placebo in mean prebronchodilator FEV1 (0.071 L; 95% CI, 0.046, 0.095 L; P < .0001). Similar improvements were observed in the secondary end points of postbronchodilator FEV1 (0.068 L; 95% CI 0.044, 0.092 L; P < .0001) and prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FVC (0.109 L; 95% CI, 0.061, 0.157 L; P < .0001 and 0.101 L; 95% CI, 0.055, 0.146 L; P < .0001, respectively). The adverse event profile was consistent with previous roflumilast studies. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (6.0% and 1.0% of patients in the roflumilast and placebo groups, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Roflumilast plays an important role in lung function improvement and is well tolerated in an Asian population. It provides an optimal treatment choice for patients with severe to very severe COPD.

19087120|t|The role of the newer antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus.
19087120|a|The emergency treatment of seizures is an important practical issue, especially the treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Benzodiazepines or older standard antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin) have typically been used as initial intravenous treatment of GCSE. As new parenteral antiepileptic drugs are developed, and more are on the horizon, questions are raised regarding their role in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). This review discusses the evidence for the treatment of GCSE, including the newer agents (valproate, levetiracetam). We correlate the treatment of SE with our modern understanding of the underlying neurophysiology and seizure duration.

19578243|a|BACKGROUND: Failure of anti-hepatitis C therapy encompasses both primary non-response and post-treatment relapse. Treatment failure to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-alpha2b and ribavirin (RBV) largely depends upon virus genotype, but the interaction between genotype, cirrhosis and pattern of treatment failure is unclear. We aimed to assess whether cirrhosis modifies the pattern of PEG-IFN-alpha2b and RBV treatment failure. METHODS: A total of 471 treatment-naive patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (106 with cirrhosis; 185 with HCV genotype 1 [HCV-1], 157 with HCV genotype 2 [HCV-2], 92 with HCV genotype 3 [HCV-3] and 37 with HCV genotype 4 [HCV-4]) were consecutively treated with PEG-IFN-alpha2b 1.5 microg weekly and weight-based RBV. RESULTS: The sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 31% in HCV-1 and HCV-4, 80% in HCV-2 and 72% in HCV-3, and were lower in cirrhotic than in non-cirrhotic HCV-1 and HCV-4 (17% versus 36%; P=0.01), and HCV-3 (33% versus 79%; P=0.001), but not HCV-2 (69% versus 83%; P=0.1) patients. Treatment failure was the consequence of lower end-of-treatment response rates (37% versus 53%; P=0.06) plus higher post-treatment relapse rates (55% versus 31%; P=0.07) in cirrhotic HCV-1 and HCV-4 patients and higher rates of post-treatment relapse in HCV-2 (29% versus 10%; P=0.01) and HCV-3 cirrhotic patients (61% versus 12%; P<0.001). By multivariate analysis, HCV-1 and HCV-4 (odds ratio [OR] 7.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.87-11.36), and cirrhosis (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.80-5.00) were independent predictors of treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhosis is an important moderator of SVR, accounting for different patterns of treatment failure in patients infected with different genotypes.

16015021|t|Acebutolol-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
16015021|a|Beta-blocking medications are rarely associated with drug-induced lupus erythematosus syndrome and have never been incriminated as a cause of subacute lupus erythematosus (SCLE). We present herein the first case of SCLE induced by acebutolol. A 57-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of a cutaneous eruption of the photo-exposed areas. One month ago, the patient had started a treatment with oral acebutolol to cure a hypertension of 1-year evolution. Physical examination revealed erythematous scaly annular plaques, involving the face, arms and trunk. Immunologic serology findings revealed a positive titer of antinuclear antibodies up to 1/1,280 with positivity of antihistone and Ro/SSA antibodies. Acebutolol was stopped, and the lesions cleared completely 4 months later. Literature data, along with our case, suggest a link between acebutolol therapy and the onset of a lupus syndrome. Although this is the first report of acebutolol-induced SCLE, we should be aware of this occurrence, and avoidance of acebutolol is recommended in patients with stigmata of lupus erythematosus.

19233108|t|Prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia in patients treated with hypolipidaemic drugs.
19233108|a|AIM: To estimate the prevalence of triglyceride and/or high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) disorders and their relationships with other cardiovascular risk factors among patients with dyslipidaemia on lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study in dyslipidaemic patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy, lipid disorders were defined as triglyceride greater than 1.5 g/L, HDL-C lesser than 0.4 g/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above the recommended concentration according to French guidelines. Based on these disorders, patients were classified into four groups: group 1, no lipid disorders; group 2, low HDL-C and/or high triglyceride concentration with normal LDL-C; group 3, isolated elevated LDL-C; and group 4, elevated LDL-C and low HDL-C and/or high triglyceride. Patients' cardiovascular risk levels were compared across groups. RESULTS: Among the 2727 patients (mean age 64.7 years, 46.7% women), 28% did not reach the target LDL-C concentration as defined by French guidelines. Prevalence rates of high triglyceride and low HDL-C were 27.2 and 10.3%, respectively. Over half (51.2%) of the patients were in group 1, 20.5% were in group 2, 16.2% in group 3 and 12.1% in group 4. Among patients meeting the target LDL-C, those with high triglyceride and/or low HDL-C exhibited a significantly higher number of risk factors (1.83 vs 1.68, p<0.001). Smoking, diabetes and hypertension were associated separately with low HDL-C and/or high triglyceride (p=0.01, p<0.0001, p=0.03, respectively). Conversely, these associations were not observed in patients who did not achieve the target LDL-C, with the exception of smoking (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: HDL-C and triglyceride disorders are relatively frequent among treated patients, particularly when cardiovascular risk level increased.

12886055|t|Oxaliplatin with weekly bolus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in pretreated advanced colorectal cancer patients: a phase II study.
12886055|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin in combination with weekly bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with 5-FU-pretreated advanced colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 39 patients with documented 5-FU-resistant advanced colorectal cancer were enrolled. All 39 patients had previously received weekly high-dose 5-FU/LV (2,600 mg/m(2) 5-FU plus 100 mg/m(2) LV as 24-hour infusion) as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)) was delivered as an intravenous infusion over 2 h on days 1 and 15, while 5-FU (500 mg/m(2)) and LV (20 mg/m(2)) were administered as an intravenous bolus on days 1, 8 and 15. One treatment course consisted of 3 consecutive weeks of therapy followed by a 1-week rest. RESULTS: In an intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate for the 39 patients was 20.5% (95% confidence interval, 7.2-33.8%). The disease was stable in 19 patients (48.7%), and progressive in 11 (28.2%). The median survival for all 39 patients was 8.9 months. The median time to progression was 5.0 months. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in only 1 patient (2.6%), and grade 2 and 3/4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 10 (25.6%) and 5 (12.8%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Oxaliplatin in combination with weekly bolus 5-FU/LV is also active in patients with advanced colorectal cancer where first-line treatment has failed.

21596410|t|Impulse control disorders and dopaminergic treatments in Parkinson's disease.
21596410|a|A group of disorders sharing a failure to resist an impulse to perform a typically pleasurable activity that is finally harmful to the person or to others are known under the common denomination of impulse control disorders (ICDs). These behaviors, possibly previously neglected by lack of awareness, are increasingly reported among PD patients. Compelling evidence has stressed the relation between dopaminergic replacement and development of ICDs in PD, especially but not exclusively, with dopamine agonist therapy. Besides dopaminergic replacement, younger age, smoking habit, presence of familiar gambling problems and alcohol abuse can increase the risk. ICDs in PD may greatly affect patients and caregivers quality of life, stressing the importance of their screening. Management strategies include a careful use of dopaminergic therapy using the lowest effective doses.

19651211|t|Mouse AMACO, a kidney and skin basement membrane associated molecule that mediates RGD-dependent cell attachment.
19651211|a|The VWA domain-containing extracellular matrix protein AMACO has not been extensively characterized and its function remains unknown. It has been proposed as a potential cancer marker and carries a rare O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation on its first EGF-like domain. AMACO is a basement membrane associated protein, however its exact localization has not been determined. Here we show by immunogold electron microscopy of mouse kidney and skin that AMACO does not occur within the basement membrane but rather subjacent to the basement membrane at its stromal surface. In skin, AMACO often colocalizes with triple-helical domains of collagen VII containing anchoring fibrils as they emerge from the basal lamina. However, the immunogold patterns for AMACO and the C-terminal end of collagen VII show discrete differences, indicating that AMACO and collagen VII do not colocalize at anchoring plaques. In contrast, the localization pattern of AMACO partially overlaps with that for collagen XVIII. In addition, mouse AMACO was shown to support beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of a keratinocyte-like cell line, HaCaT, and a fibroblast cell line, Wi26, in an RGD-dependent manner, most likely using an RGD-motif near the C-terminus of AMACO. However, the loss of cell adhesion to the C-terminal part of the human AMACO, due to the unique absence of an RGD sequence in the human protein, suggests that cell adhesion is not AMACO's major function.

2076379|t|Risk stratification after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
2076379|a|Approximately 20-30% of patients who undergo elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) require a second angioplasty within 12 months. A significant proportion of patients develop clinical cardiac events during the first year following the initial procedure. The present investigation was undertaken to establish a statistical model for predicting such events. The study group consisted of 100 patients who underwent elective PTCA at the University of Alberta Hospital. All patients were prescribed nifedipine (10 mg tid) and aspirin (325 mg daily) in addition to other medications determined by the attending cardiologist. The patients were reviewed 10 weeks after the procedure and again at the end of 1 year. The follow-up was completed on 96 patients. Within the first year, forty-five experienced cardiac events (1 death, 5 myocardial infarctions, 4 bypass surgeries, 22 repeat PTCAs). These events occurred in 29 patients. An additional 16 patients experienced significant anginal symptoms. A statistical model based upon the patients' perception of symptoms immediately after the procedure, history of hypertension, vessel subjected to PTCA, ejection fraction pre-PTCA, and occurrence of intimal dissection during PTCA was used to identify patients likely to develop cardiac events. Overall, the model classified 72% of the patients (with and without events). Such a statistical model could be used to identify patients who should be subjected to an enhanced degree of cardiologic surveillance in a rehabilitation program.

16913725|a|We report on the discovery of benzo- and pyridino- thiazolothiopurines as potent heat shock protein 90 inhibitors. The benzothiazole moiety is exceptionally sensitive to substitutions on the aromatic ring with a 7'-substituent essential for activity. Some of these compounds exhibit low nanomolar inhibition activity in a Her-2 degradation assay (28-150 nM), good aqueous solubility, and oral bioavailability profiles in mice. In vivo efficacy experiments demonstrate that compounds of this class inhibit tumor growth in an N87 human colon cancer xenograft model via oral administration as shown with compound 37 (8-(7-chlorobenzothiazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-9-(2-cyclopropylamino-ethyl)-9H- purin-6-ylamine).

2307734|t|Evidence for an intracerebral action of phenylalanine in stimulation of prolactin secretion: interaction of large neutral amino acids.
2307734|a|Phenylalanine stimulates PRL secretion when given orally or iv to normal individuals. To differentiate between hypothalamic and pituitary sites of action, we examined the effects of concurrent infusion of valine on the PRL response to iv phenylalanine in eight normal men. Since large neutral amino acids share the same high affinity blood-brain barrier transport system, entry of phenylalanine into the brain will be diminished by the simultaneous presence of high serum concentrations of valine; the pituitary, lying outside the blood-brain barrier, is not subject to these competitive effects. Valine significantly blunted the PRL response to phenylalanine, supporting an effect of phenylalanine within the blood-brain barrier to stimulate PRL release.

7588928|t|Complex frequency-dependent interaction of class-I antiarrhythmic drugs as they affect intraventricular conduction.
7588928|a|We investigated the interaction of class-I antiarrhythmic drugs as they affect intraventricular conduction of human hearts in vivo. QRS duration in signal-averaged electrocardiograms and standard electrocardiograms were measured as an index of intraventricular conduction time in 17 patients with implanted pacemakers at various pacing rates (100-180 ppm, VVI mode). Single intravenous administration of lidocaine, disopyramide or aprindine prolonged the QRS of signal-averaged electrocardiograms in a frequency-dependent manner. Lidocaine (n = 17) produced significant QRS prolongation from pre-drug control at rates > or = 120 ppm (6.2 +/- 1.4% at 180 ppm), whereas disopyramide (n = 17) and aprindine (n = 17) did so from the lowest rate (8.9 +/- 1.8% to 12.3 +/- 2.9% at 100-180 ppm with disopyramide; 14.7 +/- 1.3% to 19.3 +/- 2.2% at 100-180 ppm with aprindine). Addition of lidocaine to disopyramide (n = 17) showed an additive effect; QRS prolongation was enhanced significantly by 1.4-2.8% at rates > or = 150 ppm. In contrast, addition of lidocaine to aprindine (n = 17) showed a subtractive effect; the QRS prolongation was attenuated significantly by 1.6-2.4% at rates < 150 ppm. Combined intravenous administration of class-I antiarrhythmic drugs causes not only additive but also subtractive effects on the intraventricular conduction of the human heart, probably through their interaction on the sodium channel receptor.

16101130|t|Biomarkers of anticancer activity of R115777 (Tipifarnib, Zarnestra) in human breast cancer models in vitro.
16101130|a|BACKGROUND: Farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 (Tipifamib, Zarnestra) is active in breast cancer, but its efficacy in drug combinations has not been extensively investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity of R115777 and paclitaxel, alone and in combination, was studied in the human breast cancer cell lines, BT-474 (overexpressed HER2/neu) and MDA-MB-231 (low HER2/neu), with cell viability and biomarkers for farnesylation (HDJ-2, Rho B), tumor growth (Raf/MEK/ERK), survival (PI3K/Akt) and angiogenesis (VEGF, FGF-2, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9) as the endpoints. RESULTS: The drug combination resulted in additive cytotoxicity. R115777 +/- paclitaxel inhibited HDJ-2 farnesylation, up-regulated RhoB, transiently lowered (P)ERK/ERK and (P)Akt/Akt, reduced Raf-1 and MEK and inhibited secretion of VEGF and MMP-1. CONCLUSION: The effect of R115777 on prenylation biomarkers is consistent with its mechanism of action. The drug interfered with tumor growth, survival and angiogenesis pathways in breast cancer models with low or overexpressed HER2/neu receptor. The combination of R115777 with paclitaxel might offer clinical advantage over monotherapies.

22299411|t|Effectiveness of fixed-dose combination stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine (GPO-VIR) for treatment of naÃ¯ve HIV patients in Thailand: a 3-year follow-up.
22299411|a|Generic fixed dose combination stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP), named GPO-VIR is recommended in the HIV treatment guidelines for Thailand. The long term effectiveness and adverse effects of this drug combination for the treatment of HIV were evaluated in an ambispective study at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand from March 2002 to January 2006. A total of 152 adult treatment naive HIV patients who had received at least 12 months of GPO-VIR were enrolled. The median (IQR) CD4 cell count increased from 23 (8-94) cells/microl at baseline to 126 (38-180), 136 (98-189), 199 (141-255) and 334 (243-414) cells/microl at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (p < 0.001), respectively. The median (IQR) percentage of body weights increased from baseline by 3.0% (0.3-6.3), 6.2% (2.2-9.3), 7.3% (3.9-10.9) and 8.1% (3.4-11.9) at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively and then remained at a plateau until the end of the 3-year study. The occurrence of new opportunistic infections decreased significantly (p < 0.001) with GPO-VIR treatment. Drug resistance occurred in 5 cases (3.3%) with a median (IQR) time of 18.0 (16.5-32.5) months to occurrence. Adverse effects included hypercholesterolemia (43.2%), lipodystrophy (35.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (25%), hypertension (13.1%), peripheral neuropathy (11.9%), hyperlactatemia (2.6%) and lactic acidosis (1.3%). Thirty-six patients (27%) switched from GPO-VIR to other anti-retroviral drugs regimens due to lipodystrophy. This study showed GPO-VIR had clinical and immunological benefits, but one-third of patients had adverse effects.

17418699|t|Alcohol-drinking history and fatal injury in older adults.
17418699|a|Although most clinical guidelines for older adults allow for one drink a day in persons without a history of alcoholism, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, alcohol may contribute to fatal injury in the elderly. Using two national surveys, this case-control study determined the associations between drinking history and fatal injuries from falls, motor vehicle crashes and suicides. We performed a case-control study using 1,735 cases who died of falls, motor vehicle crashes, or suicides selected from the 1993 National Mortality Follow-Back Survey; controls (n=13,381) were a representative sample of the U.S. population from the 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey. Cases and controls were restricted to ages 55 years and older. Having 12 or more drinks in the year before death or interview for the controls was used to assess alcohol-drinking history. The unadjusted relative odds for drinkers versus nondrinkers for falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicides were 1.7, 1.7, and 1.6, respectively. Adjustment for age, gender, marital status, education, and working in the last year did not change these effect estimates, which all excluded the null value. Drinking increased the risk of suicide more for women than for men. Drinking history in older adults is associated about equally with an increased risk of fatal injury from falls, motor vehicle crashes, and suicides.

10464564|t|Cogan's syndrome: unsuccessful outcome with early combination therapy.
10464564|a|Interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms (vertigo and hearing loss) are the typical signs of Cogan's syndrome, a rare inflammatory vascular disease. Signs of vasculitis in many organ systems may appear, among which neurologic problems are sometime predominant. The efficacy of glucocorticoids on the ocular and systemic symptoms is established, but their effect on hearing loss is unknown. We describe a case of Cogan's syndrome with neurological involvement in which early treatment with combination therapy (prednisolone and cyclosporin) failed to bring ear inflammation under control.

19509275|t|The telomerase template antagonist GRN163L alters MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell morphology, inhibits growth, and augments the effects of paclitaxel.
19509275|a|Telomeres are repetitive (TTAGGG)(n) DNA sequences found at the end of chromosomes that protect the ends from recombination, end to end fusions, and recognition as damaged DNA. Telomerase activity can be detected in 85% to 90% of human tumors, which stabilizes telomeres to prevent apoptosis or cellular senescence. Previous reports showed the efficacy of the novel telomerase template antagonist, GRN163L, as a potential anticancer agent. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the molecular effects of GRN163L in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and to determine whether GRN163L could be used in mechanism-based combination therapy for breast cancer. We observed that GRN163L reduced MDA-MB-231 growth rates without a significant effect on breast cancer cell viability within the first 14 days in vitro. In addition, GRN163L altered cell morphology, actin filament organization, and focal adhesion formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, the cellular response to GRN163L significantly augmented the effects of the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo compared with paclitaxel alone or a mismatch control oligonucleotide plus paclitaxel. Furthermore, in vitro MDA-MB-231 invasive potential was significantly inhibited with GRN163L and paclitaxel. These data support a rationale for potentially combining GRN163L with paclitaxel for the treatment of breast cancer in the clinical setting.

24180784|t|Otoacoustic emission sensitivity to exposure to styrene and noise.
24180784|a|The ototoxic effect of the exposure to styrene is evaluated, also in the presence of simultaneous exposure to noise, using otoacoustic emissions as biomarkers of mild cochlear damage. Transient-evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded and analyzed in a sample of workers (15 subjects) exposed to styrene and noise in a fiberglass manufacturing facility and in a control group of 13 non-exposed subjects. Individual exposure monitoring of the airborne styrene concentrations was performed, as well as biological monitoring, based on the urinary concentration of two styrene metabolites, the Mandelic and Phenylglyoxylic acids. Noise exposure was evaluated using wearable phonometers, and hearing loss with pure tone audiometry. Due to their different job tasks, one group of workers was exposed to high noise and low styrene levels, another group to higher styrene levels, close to the limit of 20   ppm, and to low noise levels. A significant negative correlation was found between the otoacoustic emission levels and the concentration of the styrene urinary metabolites. Otoacoustic emissions, and particularly distortion products, were able to discriminate the exposed workers from the controls, providing also a rough estimate of the slope of the dose-response relation between otoacoustic levels and styrene exposure.

9816328|t|Profound suppression of plasma estrogens by megestrol acetate in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.
9816328|a|Twelve postmenopausal women suffering from advanced breast cancer had plasma estrogens, androgens, cortisol, and gonadotropins determined before therapy and during treatment with megestrol acetate (MA) in oral doses escalated from 40 to 160 mg. The plasma clearance and production rate of estrone and estrone sulfate were determined before treatment and after 4 weeks of therapy with 160 mg MA. Treatment with MA suppressed plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol in a dose-dependent manner to <10% of pretreatment values. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate were suppressed to 18-29% of pretreatment values, whereas the gonadotropins were suppressed to 35-52%. The plasma clearance rates of estrone and estrone sulfate were increased by a mean value of 23.7% (P < 0.01) and 23.5% (P < 0.025), whereas the production rates were reduced by 76.7% (P < 0.0005) and 76.1% (P < 0.0005), respectively. Our findings indicate that MA causes profound suppression of adrenal steroid production but in addition suppresses ovarian secretion of androgens in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The reduction in plasma estrogens is comparable to values obtained with commonly used aromatase inhibitors and may be responsible for its antitumor effects in breast cancer.

1279198|t|Novel mutation in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase gene that encodes cross-resistance to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine.
1279198|a|We have used the technique of in vitro selection to generate variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that are resistant to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and cross-resistant to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC). The complete reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding regions, plus portions of flanking sequences, of viruses possessing a ddI-resistant phenotype were cloned and sequenced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. We observed that several of these viruses possessed mutations at amino acid sites 184 (Met-->Val; ATG-->GTG) and 294 (Pro-->Ser; CCA-->TCA). These mutations were introduced in the pol gene of infectious, cloned HXB2-D DNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Viral replication assays confirmed the importance of site 184 with regard to resistance to ddI. The recombinant viruses thus generated displayed more than fivefold-greater resistance to ddI than parental HXB2-D did. Moreover, more than fivefold-greater resistance to ddC was also documented; however, the recombinant viruses continued to be inhibited by zidovudine (AZT). No resistance to ddI, ddC, or AZT was introduced by inclusion of mutation site 294 in the pol gene of HXB2-D. PCR analysis performed on viral samples obtained from patients receiving long-term ddI therapy confirmed the presence of mutation site 184 in five of seven cases tested. In three of these five positive cases, the wild-type codon was also detected, indicating that mixtures of viral quasispecies were apparently present. Viruses possessing a ddI resistance phenotype were isolated from both subjects whose viruses contained only the mutated rather than wild-type codon at position 184 as well as from a third individual, whose viruses appeared to be mostly of the mutated variety.

24258622|t|Drug-induced reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer treated with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib.
24258622|a|BACKGROUND: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the renal side effects of crizotinib have not been investigated previously. METHODS: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine-based prediction equation during the first 12 weeks of crizotinib therapy and after crizotinib but before the introduction of any further systemic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with stage IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with crizotinib were identified. The mean eGFR decreased by 23.9% compared with baseline (P <   .0001; 95% confidence interval, 21.3%-26.6%), with the majority of the decrease occurring within the first 2 weeks of therapy. Clinical history and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios did not suggest prerenal causes. The objective response rate among evaluable patients (n = 27) was 41%. Tumor shrinkage was not correlated with changes in eGFR (correlation coefficient, -0.052; P =   .798). Among the 16 patients for whom data after treatment with crizotinib were available, recovery to within 84% of the baseline eGFR occurred in all patients. After adjusting for the number of scans with intravenous contrast and the use of known nephrotoxic drugs, the issue of whether a patient was on or off crizotinib treatment was found to be significantly associated with changes in eGFR (P <   .0001). CONCLUSIONS: As assessed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration prediction equation, eGFR is reduced by treatment with crizotinib, but the majority of patients will recover their eGFR after the cessation of therapy. The early onset, size of the change, minimal cumulative effect, and rapid reversibility raise the possibility that this may be a pharmacological and/or tubular creatinine secretion effect rather than a direct nephrotoxic effect. Increased vigilance with regard to the concomitant use of renally cleared medications or nephrotoxic agents should be considered for patients receiving crizotinib and, when eGFR is reduced, additional renal investigations should be undertaken.

18586338|t|Long-term cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel in STEMI patients.
18586338|a|BACKGROUND: The COMMIT trial demonstrated that clopidogrel produced a 9% relative reduction in death, reinfarction or stroke (9.2% vs. 10.1%, 95% CI: 0.86-0.97) in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. METHODS: Between 08/1999 and 05/2005, 45,852 STEMI patients were randomized to clopidogrel (n=22,961) or matching placebo (n=22,891) in addition to aspirin. The rate of initial hospitalizations for death, non-fatal myocardial infarction with/without major complications and PCI within 28 days was calculated based on the COMMIT clinical paper. Three CURE papers, concerning non-STEMI patients, were used to estimate the event rates between 29 days and 1 year. Hospitalizations were assigned a diagnosis-related group (DRG). Costs for each DRG were estimated from the Medicare reimbursement rate. Clopidogrel was assumed to be given for 1 year, priced at $4.22/day. Life expectancy gain as a result of the prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke was estimated using Framingham data. RESULTS: Within 28 days, adding clopidogrel to aspirin is likely a dominant strategy, lowering the event rate (9.2% vs. 10.1%) without an increase in cost ($7791 vs. $7797). Over a lifetime, treating for 1 year with clopidogrel-plus-aspirin produced a gain of 0.1187 life years at an incremental cost of $1269 compared to aspirin alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $10,691/life year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that ICERs for clopidogrel are well below the common benchmark ceiling ratio of $50,000/life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of clopidogrel to aspirin, given up to 1 year, in the setting of STEMI is a highly cost-effective strategy.

16414027|t|Inhibitory effect of dietary phenolic compounds on Chlamydia pneumoniae in cell cultures.
16414027|a|Chlamydial infections are very common worldwide. All chlamydial species have a tendency to cause persistent infections, which have been associated to several chronic diseases including blinding trachoma, infertility and coronary heart disease (CHD). At present, no efficient treatment for the eradication of chronic chlamydial infections exists and, thus, new antichlamydial compounds are urgently needed. This study was designed to screen antichlamydial activity of natural flavonoids and other natural and structurally similar synthetic compounds against Chlamydia pneumoniae in human cell line (HL). HL cells were infected with C. pneumoniae and incubated 72 h with studied compounds. Reduction in the number of inclusions was determined with immunofluorescence staining. In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration was also determined for some of the most active compounds. Thirty seven percentage of the studied compounds (57 in total) were highly active against C. pneumoniae and all the studied compounds were non-toxic to the host cells at studied concentrations. Our study revealed direct antichlamydial effect for selected polyphenolic compounds against C. pneumoniae, in vitro. We also demonstrated the ability of some of the investigated compounds to accumulate inside cells or into cell membranes and cause inhibition, even when present only prior to infection.

23869238|t|Berberine Targets AP-2/hTERT, NF-kB/COX-2, HIF-1a/VEGF and Cytochrome-c/Caspase Signaling to Suppress Human Cancer Cell Growth.
23869238|a|Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid isolated from Chinese herbs, has a long history of uses for the treatment of multiple diseases, including cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of actions of BBR in human lung cancer cells remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which BBR inhibits cell growth in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Treatment with BBR promoted cell morphology change, inhibited cell migration, proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell apoptosis. Further molecular mechanism study showed that BBR simultaneously targeted multiple cell signaling pathways to inhibit NSCLC cell growth. Treatment with BBR inhibited AP-2a and AP-2b expression and abrogated their binding on hTERT promoters, thereby inhibiting hTERT expression. Knockdown of AP-2a and AP-2b by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. BBR also suppressed the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 NF-kB proteins and their binding to COX-2 promoter, causing inhibition of COX-2. BBR also downregulated HIF-1a and VEGF expression and inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Knockdown of HIF-1a by siRNA considerably augmented the BBR-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Moreover, BBR treatment triggered cytochrome-c release from mitochondrial inter-membrane space into cytosol, promoted cleavage of caspase and PARP, and affected expression of BAX and Bcl-2, thereby activating apoptotic pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BBR inhibited NSCLC cell growth by simultaneously targeting AP-2/hTERT, NF-kB/COX-2, HIF-1a/VEGF, PI3K/AKT, Raf/MEK/ERK and cytochrome-c/caspase signaling pathways. Our findings provide new insights into understanding the anticancer mechanisms of BBR in human lung cancer therapy.

7798824|t|A comparative study of coumadin and aspirin for primary cardioembolic stroke and thromboembolic preventions of chronic rheumatic mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation.
7798824|a|The comparative study of the efficacy of coumadin and aspirin in primary cardioembolic stroke prevention of chronic rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis) with atrial fibrillation was conducted at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the trial. Allocation of patients into coumadin or aspirin groups depended upon the patients' choice. Nineteen patients were given coumadin at the adjusted dosage to maintain the therapeutic range of International Normalised Ratio between 1.5-3. Sixty patients were given aspirin at the fixed dosage of 75 mg per day. Six patients were lost to follow-up over the 3 yr period; four in the aspirin group and 2 in the coumadin group. There were three patients with nonfatal cardioembolic stroke in the aspirin group but none in the coumadin group after three years of follow-up. Six patients had mitral valve replacement during the study (i.e. three patients in each group). There were complications in 12 patients, 10 in the aspirin (16.6 per cent) and 2 in the coumadin (10.5 per cent) group. The complications in coumadin group were minor bleeding over the thigh in one patient and generalised ecchymosis over the whole body in one other. In the aspirin group, the complication was gastrointestional symptoms, mainly epigastric pain, but no frank bleeding was observed. Primary prevention of cardioembolic stroke in chronic rheumatic heart disease was found to be more effective with coumadin than aspirin. Our study does not support the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiac embolism in chronic rheumatic heart disease.

9925253|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low Raf- kinase activity has been reported to be associated with radioresistance in epithelial tumor cell lines and with paclitaxel sensitivity in cervical tumor cells. Paclitaxel might thus be effective in eliminating radioresistant clones from cervical tumors, even in the absence of synergistic interaction between these therapeutic modalities. We thus established the relationship between Raf-1 kinase activity and radiosensitivity in human cervical tumor cells and determined if paclitaxel is preferentially cytotoxic to radio-resistant tumor clones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established and contrasted the radiation and paclitaxel sensitivity of 12 human cervical tumor clones that exhibited a wide range of Raf-1 kinase activity. RESULTS: Raf-1 kinase activity was inversely correlated (P = 0.001) with SF2 values in the 12 cervical tumor clones studied. Paclitaxel was preferentially cytotoxic to radioresistant tumor clones, with the level of paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity being significantly (P = 0.0016) influenced by Raf-1 kinase activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data indicate that there are marked, but completely opposite, Raf-1 kinase dependencies of radiation and paclitaxel cytotoxicity in cervical tumor cells. The use of combined paclitaxel and radiotherapy treatment may thus lead to higher local control rates for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Circumstantially, our data suggest that the greatest therapeutic gains might accrue if paclitaxel was administered when there is the greatest proportion of tumor clones with low Raf-1 kinase activity. It may thus be desirable to use paclitaxel towards the end of radiotherapy treatment or post-radiotherapy as consolidation therapy.

25130124|t|Bortezomib-induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: clinical and imaging features.
25130124|a|Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare and potentially harmful complication in patients receiving targeted chemotherapy. We herein present a case of PRES that occurred after 33 days of high-dose bortezomib treatment and propose both overwhelmed cerebral autoregulation and toxin-mediated blood-brain barrier damage as the underlying mechanisms based on the imaging findings. A favorable recovery was observed two days after achieving stringent hypertension control and withholding bortezomib. Follow-up images obtained two weeks later unveiled a dramatic remission, with faint areas of subcortical hyperintensity in the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. With explicit clinical and imaging features, this case highlights the need for early recognition of PRES during the clinical course of bortezomib therapy.

22020729|t|Opposing effects of particle pollution, ozone, and ambient temperature on arterial blood pressure.
22020729|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes increases the risk of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension and raises the risk of cardiovascular death during heat waves and high pollution episodes. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether short-term exposures to air pollution (fine particles, ozone) and heat resulted in perturbation of arterial blood pressure (BP) in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We conducted a panel study in 70 subjects with T2DM, measuring BP by automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer and pulse wave analysis every 2 weeks on up to five occasions (355 repeated measures). Hourly central site measurements of fine particles, ozone, and meteorology were conducted. We applied linear mixed models with random participant intercepts to investigate the association of fine particles, ozone, and ambient temperature with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP in a multipollutant model, controlling for season, meteorological variables, and subject characteristics. RESULTS: An interquartile increase in ambient fine particle mass [particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of  <= 2.5 µm (PM2.5)] and in the traffic component black carbon in the previous 5 days (3.54 and 0.25 µg/m3, respectively) predicted increases of 1.4 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 2.9 mmHg] and 2.2 mmHg (95% CI: 0.4, 4.0 mmHg) in systolic BP (SBP) at the population geometric mean, respectively. In contrast, an interquartile increase in the 5-day mean of ozone (13.3 ppb) was associated with a 5.2 mmHg (95% CI: -8.6, -1.8 mmHg) decrease in SBP. Higher temperatures were associated with a marginal decrease in BP. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with T2DM, PM was associated with increased BP, and ozone was associated with decreased BP. These effects may be clinically important in patients with already compromised autoregulatory function.

12238146|t|Advantages of in vitro cytotoxicity testing by using primary rat hepatocytes in comparison with established cell lines.
12238146|a|We investigated and compared the cytotoxicity of 16 reference compounds in four in vitro systems: primary cultured rat hepatocytes, hepatoma HepG2 cell line, non-hepatic HeLa and Balb/c 3T3 cell lines. After 24 hr of exposure to the test compounds, the water-soluble tetrazolium salts WST-1 assay was used as an endpoint to evaluate cytotoxicity. Acetaminophen, diclofenac sodium cyclophosphamide and disulfiram displayed from 2 to more than 10 times higher IC50 values in three cell lines than in rat primary cultured hepatocytes. The cytotoxic effects of aspirin, amiodarone, clorfibiric acid, chlorpromazine, erythomycin, lithocholic acid, cisplatin and quinidine in rat hepatocytes were similar or 2 times stronger than those observed in cell lines. Ketoconazole resulted in the lowest IC50 value in the HeLa cell line. The data suggested that the compounds which are known to be metabolism-mediated liver toxicants have a differential hepatotoxicity in vitro and that primary cultured rat hepatocytes could represent a valuable tool for both screening and study of the effects of bio-transformation on the cytotoxicity of new chemical entities and xenobiotics in vitro.

10854542|t|Concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: a feasibility study.
10854542|a|Initial clinical results of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with high-dose intraoperative radiotherapy (IOR) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer were analyzed. Between June 1996 and May 1999, 6 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer without distant metastasis were treated with preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by IOR. Preoperative radiation therapy was given by the dynamic arc conformal technique with a daily fraction of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 45 Gy in 5 weeks. Cisplatin (5 mg/day for 4 weeks) and 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/day for 5 weeks) were administered continuously during preoperative radiation therapy. IOR as a single dose of 28 or 30 Gy was given to the gross tumor volume using electron beams of 15- to 22-MeV. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was well tolerated, although all of the patients complained of nausea and fatigue. Two patients developed grade III leukopenia. No other serious acute toxicity was noted. The median survival time of the 6 patients was 17.5 months, which was significantly longer than that of our historical control treated with external radiation therapy with IOR (8 months), although the difference in survival was borderline significant (p=0.068). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by high-dose IOR was well tolerated in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, and the initial clinical results appeared promising.

15601641|t|Cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, hepatitis B, and risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in Korea.
15601641|a|BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, particularly in Asia and Africa, where infectious hepatitis and aflatoxin exposures are common. We conducted a prospective cohort study of liver cancer in Korea to assess the independent effects and interactions of smoking, alcohol consumption, and hepatitis B on risk of mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: From a total of 1,283,112 men and women free of cancer at baseline, 3807 died from liver cancer during follow-up from 1993 to 2002. All participants reported their smoking and alcohol consumption, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status was documented for 47.2% of the participants. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma were calculated using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, alcohol drinking, diabetes, and HBsAg status. RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with increased risk of mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma in men (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.3 to 1.6) but not women (RR = 1.1; CI = 0.8 to 1.7). The relative risk of mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma for male HBsAg carriers was 24.3 (95% CI = 21.9 to 26.9) times that in HBsAg-negative males; the relative risk for HBsAg-positive women was 54.4 (95% CI = 24.8 to 119.5). Heavy alcohol drinking was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma mortality risk in the subgroup of men who were tested for HBsAg (RR =1.5; 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.0). There was no interaction among smoking, alcohol drinking, and HBsAg in terms of hepatocellular carcinoma mortality. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and HBsAg were independently associated with increased risk of mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma but did not interact synergistically. The relatively higher increase in mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma in HBsAg-seropositive women compared with men merits further research.

8673069|t|Antisense inhibition of the 27 kDa heat shock protein production affects growth rate and cytoskeletal organization in MCF-7 cells.
8673069|a|MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with the human HSP27 antisense cDNA and the neomycin resistance gene, included in the constitutive expression vector pSVL, and the phenotypical changes associated with decreased expression of the HSP27 protein were analysed. Three out of 10 neomycin-resistant clones obtained proliferated normally and showed a normal HSP27 content (Western blot). The seven other clones (designated as alpha HSP27 clones) were characterized by a dramatic growth inhibition associated with alterations in cellular morphology. Cells became progressively hypertrophied, exhibited lamellar protrusions and tended to lose contact with each other. They also acquired characteristics of secretory cells, namely the presence of numerous refractile granules and secretory canaliculi. Among the alpha HSP27 clones, two were immunocytochemically analysed for HSP27 content. Both clones were immunonegative for HSP27, contrary to parental cells and neo-transfectants. Actin immunostaining in one of these HSP27 negative clones revealed that microfilament organization changed from diffuse to punctate distribution. Our data support the current concept of a role for HSP27 in cell growth and differentiation and further suggests that this might occur through a control on actin polymerization-depolymerization.

15774254|t|Potassium paraaminobenzoate (POTABA) in the treatment of Peyronie's disease: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized study.
15774254|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of potassium paraaminobenzoate (Potaba) in Peyronie's disease in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study during a 12-months period of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 103 patients with Peyronie's disease and a history <12 months, non-calcified plaques and without pre-treatment were included. 51 were randomized to potassium paraaminobenzoate, 52 to placebo receiving 4 x 3g/day for 12 months. Follow-up was performed during the treatment period. Response has been defined as regression in plaque-size and/or reduction in penile curvature of at least 30%. Data analysis was focussed on 75 patients who completed the study [valid-cases (VC)]. RESULTS: No severe adverse events occurred. Response rates were 74.3% on potassium paraaminobenzoate and 50.0% on placebo (p=0.016). Mean plaque-size decreased from 259 mm(2) to 142 mm(2) in the treatment arm. In the placebo group, plaque-size aggravated from 259 mm(2) to 303 mm(2) after 6 months but improved slightly to 233 mm(2) after 12 months. Differences between the groups were significant (p=0.042). Pre-existing curvature did not improve under the drug (p=0.066) but comparing the development of new curvature or deterioration of pre-existing curvature under potassium paraaminobenzoate penile deviation remained stable. However, under placebo penile curvature deteriorated significantly in 32.5% of the cases (p<0.001). No significant differences concerning decrease of pain could be observed between the two groups (82.6% vs. 77.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a significant plaque-related effect of potassium paraaminobenzoate. There was no relevant difference with regard to improvement of pre-existing penile deviation. However, under potassium paraaminobenzoate a significant protective effect on deterioration of penile curvature could be demonstrated. Potassium paraaminobenzoate appears to be useful to stabilize the disorder and prevent progression of penile curvature.

22673230|t|Up-regulating relaxin expression by G-quadruplex interactive ligand to achieve antifibrotic action.
22673230|a|Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological change in a variety of heart diseases contributing to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis. Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined. In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine. The G-rich sequences and the G-quadruplexes were localized adjacent to the binding motif of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, which negatively regulates relaxin expression. Thus, we hypothesized that the formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes by berberine could influence relaxin expression. We found that berberine-induced formation of G-quadruplexes did increase relaxin gene expression measured at mRNA and protein levels. Formation of G-quadruplexes significantly reduced STAT3 binding to the promoter of relaxin gene. This was associated with consequent increase in the binding of RNA polymerase II and STAT5a to relaxin gene promoter. In cardiac fibroblasts and rats treated with angiotensin II, berberine was found to suppress fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and extent of cardiac fibrosis through up-regulating relaxin. The antifibrotic action of berberine in vitro and in vivo was similar to that by exogenous relaxin. Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin.

20739614|t|Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in patients with an axial flow left ventricular assist device.
20739614|a|BACKGROUND: Rotary blood pumps used as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) allow for long-term support and may become suitable alternatives to heart transplantation. Effects of this technology on the coagulation system are not completely understood, leading to controversial anticoagulation protocols. Thus, we investigated the primary hemostasis in patients with chronic LVAD therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six outpatients received axial flow LVAD (HeartMate II; Thoratec) for a median support time of 4.5 months. In a cross-sectional protocol, platelet aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine, von Willebrand antigen (vWF:AG), and collagen-binding capacity (vWF:CB) were obtained. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimer analyses were performed, and patients were screened for bleeding events. This analysis was repeated after removal of the device for transplantation or recovery (n=12) and after a median of 15.5 months in ongoing patients (n=11). In all patients on devices, severe impairment of platelet aggregation as well as a loss of large vWF multimers were found. In 10 patients, a decreased vWF:CB/vWF:AG ratio was observed. Bleeding episodes occurred with an incidence of 0.17 per patient-year. After removal of the device, normal patterns of platelet aggregation, multimer analysis, and vWF:CB/vWF:AG ratio were recorded. In the second analysis of ongoing patients, impairment of platelet aggregation and loss of large vWF multimers were verified. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of von Willebrand syndrome type 2 was established in all patients after LVAD implantation, and bleeding events confirmed this finding. Reversibility of this condition was found after removal of the device.

16861053|t|Corticosteroid therapy in the age of infliximab: acute and 1-year outcomes in newly diagnosed children with Crohn's disease.
16861053|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe 3-month and 1-year outcomes of children with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with corticosteroids within 30 days of diagnosis, with particular emphasis on the influence of infliximab on these outcomes. We also aimed to determine whether there are clinical or laboratory characteristics associated with corticosteroid therapy outcomes. METHODS: Data from 109 children were drawn from a multicenter observational registry that was started in 2002. Clinical characteristics and data on corticosteroid and other therapies were recorded prospectively. Corticosteroid therapy outcomes at 3 months were defined as complete acute response, partial response, or corticosteroid resistance. At 1 year, corticosteroid responsiveness, dependence, and surgical rates were determined. Infliximab's influence on short- and long-term outcomes also was investigated. RESULTS: At 3 months, 65 of 109 (60%) patients had a complete acute response to corticosteroids, 26 (24%) had a partial response, and 18 (17%) were corticosteroid resistant. At 1 year, 61% were corticosteroid responsive, 31% were corticosteroid dependent, and 8% required surgery. Irrespective of the duration of corticosteroid treatment, 16 of 24 of corticosteroid-dependent/resistant patients rapidly discontinued corticosteroids after starting infliximab. No clinical or laboratory characteristics at diagnosis predicted short-term outcome. Growth impairment at diagnosis increased risk for corticosteroid dependence or surgery at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months, 84% of children had a complete or partial response to corticosteroids. However, despite concomitant immunomodulators, at 1 year 31% were corticosteroid dependent and 8% required surgery. Infliximab improves outcomes of corticosteroid-dependent/resistant patients because the duration of corticosteroid use can be controlled by initiating treatment with infliximab.

8589302|t|Cytokine production during in vitro hemodialysis with new and formaldehyde- or renalin-reprocessed cellulose dialyzers.
8589302|a|Critics of reuse have suggested that patients treated with reprocessed dialyzers are exposed to pyrogen trapped from the water or solutions used during the reprocessing cycle, thereby triggering the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cachexia. To test this hypothesis, the production of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during in vitro dialysis with new or reprocessed cellulose dialyzers was compared. An in vitro closed-loop dialysis circuit was created with standard hemodialysis blood lines and either new cellulose dialyzers or dialyzers reprocessed 10 times with either formaldehyde/bleach (formaldehyde) or peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (Renalin). The circuit was rinsed with 2 L or more of pyrogen-free normal saline before the start of in vitro dialysis until the blood compartment tested negative for residual formaldehyde/Renalin. Heparinized whole blood from healthy volunteers was circulated for 3 h in the blood compartment at 100 mL/min at 37 degrees C. The dialysate compartment was sealed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were harvested from the blood compartment before and at the end of 3 h of in vitro dialysis. Total IL-1 alpha synthesis (cell associated plus secreted) by unstimulated and endotoxin-stimulated PBMC was measured by a specific, non-cross-reactive radioimmunoassay. After 3 h of in vitro dialysis, IL-1 alpha production (in picograms per 2.5 million PBMC) by unstimulated PBMC increased from 354 +/- 63 at baseline to 454 +/- 57 with new dialyzers (P = 0.25), from 453 +/- 101 to 450 +/- 67 with formaldehyde-reprocessed dialyzers (P = 0.98), and from 360 +/- 61 to 538 +/- 144 with Renalin-reprocessed dialyzers (P = 0.23). IL-1 alpha production by endotoxin-stimulated PBMC increased from 5,214 +/- 996 to 9,237 +/- 929 with new dialyzers (P < = 0.001), from 6,395 +/- 955 to 9,636 +/- 1,058 with formaldehyde-reprocessed dialyzers (P = 0.006), and from 7,561 +/- 1,000 to 10,092 +/- 2,470 with Renalin-reprocessed dialyzers (P = 0.32). However, there were no significant differences among groups with respect to IL-1 alpha production by unstimulated or endotoxin-stimulated PBMC either before or after 3 h of in vitro dialysis. These data argue against the suggestion that exposure to reprocessed dialyzers results in enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. In fact, reprocessed dialyzers probably induce less cytokine production than do new cellulose dialyzers.

17710425|t|Regulation of the extracellular matrix remodeling by lutein in dermal fibroblasts, melanoma cells, and ultraviolet radiation exposed fibroblasts.
17710425|a|With aging and cancer there is increased expression or activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade and remodel the structural extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, exposure of skin to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (photoaging) leads to loss of cell viability, membrane damage, and deposition of excessive elastotic material. Lutein has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, photoprotective, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The goal of this research was to investigate lutein's anti-aging and anti-carcinogenic effects via the regulation of the extracellular matrix remodeling. To this purpose, the effects of lutein on the expression of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) in dermal fibroblasts (intrinsic aging) and melanoma cells were examined. Further, for lutein's photoprotective effects, the regulation of cell viability, membrane integrity, and elastin expression in the non-irradiated, and UVA or UVB radiation exposed fibroblasts were analyzed. Lutein significantly inhibited MMP-1 expression, transcriptionally, and MMP-2 protein levels in dermal fibroblasts, without altering TIMPs expression. It significantly inhibited MMP-1 expression in melanoma cells while stimulating TIMP-2. Lutein did not alter fibroblast or melanoma cell viability or membrane integrity. In ultraviolet radiation exposed fibroblasts, lutein improved cell viability, membrane integrity and inhibited elastin expression, though more significantly in the UVB exposed fibroblasts. In summary, the mechanism to lutein's anti-aging and anti-carcinogenic effects include the inhibition of MMP to TIMP ratio in dermal fibroblasts and melanoma cells, and the inhibition of cell loss, membrane damage and elastin expression in ultraviolet radiation exposed fibroblasts.

2354674|t|Indoor air pollution in a Kenyan village.
2354674|a|In April 1986, a study was carried out within rural households in Maragua area, Muranga District, Republic of Kenya, to assess the degree of indoor air pollution and to find its relationship, if any, to acute respiratory infections (ARI) among children aged below 5 years within the study. This study was carried out within an ongoing aetiological and epidemiological community study on ARI as a collaborative effort between the Department of Paediatrics, University of Nairobi; the Department of Chemistry, Kenyatta University; the Department of Environmental Sciences, Agricultural University, Wagenigen, The Netherlands; the World Health Organization; and the Ministry of Health, Republic of Kenya. Repeated 24 hour measurements of respirable suspended particles (RSP) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), were carried out in 36 randomly selected houses where most of the cooking was done on open fires using firewood and crop residues as fuel. Data on house characteristics and activity in the study were gathered by questionnaire. The mean of 24 hour average RSP concentration (1400mg/m3), average during the 7 hours of daily burning (3000-4000mg/m3), and evening peak levels (up to 3600mg/m3) indicate that deleterious health effects due to exposure to excessive levels of toxic pollutants in smoke from biomass combustion are likely to occur especially among pre-school children and women. Concentrations of selected polycyclic hydrocarbons in the particulate material were found to be high. It was not possible to demonstrate a relationship between the indoor air pollution and episodes of ARI partly because of small sample size and also the more or less homogeneous nature of pollution among all the households.

20981441|t|Clinical characteristics of children with group A streptococcal toxic shock syndrome admitted to pediatric intensive care units.
20981441|a|Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a very rare and severe form of group A streptococcal infection whose clinical characteristics, therapy, morbidity, and mortality in children are not well known. Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of STSS in a series of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). A multicenter, retrospective study of children with STSS admitted to 14 PICUs between January 1998 and December 2009 was conducted. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively by chart review. Data from 41 children were collected, 90% corresponding to the second half of the study period. Initial symptoms and signs were nonspecific. All patients developed shock and organ dysfunction, 78.0% developed coagulopathy, 70.7% neurologic dysfunction, and 68.3% respiratory failure. Rapid pharyngeal test for Streptococcus was positive in 78.0%. Initial leukocyte count was quite variable, with leukopenia present in 51.2% of patients and leukocytosis in 31.7%. Children were treated with antibiotics against group A Streptococcus (GAS), usually G penicillin or cephalosporin plus clindamycin. After a median PICU stay of 7 days (range 0-41), 65.8% of patients survived, 26.8% with sequelae. The cause of death of the 11 non-survivors was refractory shock and multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: STSS is a very severe condition secondary to invasive GAS infection. It can occur at any age, but especially in young children. Due to the lack of specific symptoms and signs and its very rapid progression to shock and organ dysfunction, pediatricians and emergency physicians must be aware of this possibility and immediately initiate aggressive treatment when suspected.

18598423|t|Irreversible color vision losses in patients with chronic mercury vapor intoxication.
18598423|a|This longitudinal study addresses the reversibility of color vision losses in subjects who had been occupationally exposed to mercury vapor. Color discrimination was assessed in 20 Hg-exposed patients (mean age = 42.4 +/- 6.5 years; 6 females and 14 males) with exposure to Hg vapor during 10.5 +/- 5.3 years and away from the work place (relative to 2002) for 6.8 +/- 4.2 years. During the Hg exposure or up to one year after ceasing it, mean urinary Hg concentration was 47 +/- 35.4 mug/g creatinine. There was no information on Hg urinary concentration at the time of the first tests, in 2002 (Ventura et al., 2005), but at the time of the follow-up tests, in 2005, this value was 1.4 +/- 1.4 microg/g creatinine for patients compared with 0.5 +/- 0.5 microg/g creatinine for controls (different group from the one in Ventura et al. (2005)). Color vision was monocularly assessed using the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT). Hg-exposed patients had significantly worse color discrimination (p < 0.02) than controls, as evaluated by the size of MacAdam's color discrimination ellipses and color discrimination thresholds along protan, deutan, and tritan confusion axes. There were no significant differences between the results of the study in Ventura et al. (2005) and in the present follow-up measurements, in 2005, except for worsening of the tritan thresholds in the best eye in 2005. Both chromatic systems, blue-yellow and red-green, were affected in the first evaluation (Ventura et al., 2005) and remained impaired in the follow-up testing, in 2005. These findings indicate that following a long-term occupational exposure to Hg vapor, even several years away from the source of intoxication, color vision impairment remains irreversible.

8294386|t|Characteristics of desipramine-refractory depression.
8294386|a|BACKGROUND: To determine the predictors of desipramine-refractory depression, the authors examined the outcome in patients with major depression who were admitted to a general hospital and treated with desipramine adjusted to an adequate blood level. METHOD: Sixty-eight consecutive inpatients with DSM-III nonpsychotic unipolar major depression who had failed to respond to 1 week of hospitalization without drug treatment were studied. Outcome was assessed with the Yale Depression Inventory after a 4-week desipramine trial in which 24-hour plasma concentrations were used to rapidly achieve a therapeutic desipramine level. RESULTS: Poor response to a therapeutic desipramine trial, which occurred in 15 of 50 patients, was significantly associated with definite personality disorder, prior treatment failure, near delusional status, age < or = 35 years, duration of depressive episode, recurrence of depression, dysthymia, and secondary depression. The first four items remained significantly correlated with poor response when the presence of the other items was accounted for using multiple regression. Drug response was not predicted by the diagnosis of melancholia (DSM-III and DSM-III-R) or initial severity of the depressive episode. CONCLUSION: The four strongest correlates of outcome were highly predictive of drug response. In patients with two or more predictors, only 25% (4 of 16) responded, while in those with one or no predictors, 91% (31 of 34) responded.

24343157|t|Multiple sclerosis disease progression and paradichlorobenzene: a tale of mothballs and toilet cleaner.
24343157|a|IMPORTANCE: Environmental factors are thought to be critical in the initiation and perpetuation of multiple sclerosis disease activity. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a woman in her late 30s with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, who continued to accumulate neurological disability despite long-term natalizumab treatment. The patient continued to have visual symptoms, left leg weakness, and gait instability. In addition, she subacutely developed an encephalopathy. Our investigations revealed that the patient had a long-standing history of chewing on toilet bowl deodorizing cakes. The main ingredient in this product is 99.9% paradichlorobenzene, which is also used in mothballs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case illustrates that environmental causes for neurological deterioration should be investigated in patients with multiple sclerosis who display a rapidly progressive disease course and in whom potent pharmacotherapies fail. One possible cause is the ingestion of paradichlorobenzene-containing mothballs and toilet cleaners.

20626210|t|Efficacy of fixed-dose combination therapy in the treatment of patients with hypertension: focus on amlodipine/valsartan.
20626210|a|Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality.

24892824|t|Assessment of methods used to determine the safety of the topical insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET).
24892824|a|N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) has been registered for commercial use as an insect repellent for over five decades, and is used widely across the world. Concerns over the safety of DEET first emerged during the 1980s after reports of encephalopathy following DEET exposure, particularly in children. However, the role of DEET in either the illness or deaths was and remains purely speculative. In response to these cases a number of reviews and investigations of DEET safety were carried out. Here we examine the methods used and information available to determine the safety of DEET in humans. Animal testing, observational studies and intervention trials have found no evidence of severe adverse events associated with recommended DEET use. Minor adverse effects noted in animal trials were associated with very large doses and were not replicated between different test species. The safety surveillance from extensive humans use reveals no association with severe adverse events. This review compares the toxicity assessment using three different models to define the risk assessment and safety threshold for DEET use in humans and discusses the clinical consequences of the thresholds derived from the models.The theoretical risks associated with wearing an insect repellent should be weighed against the reduction or prevention of the risk of fatal or debilitating diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever and filariasis. With over 48 million European residents travelling to regions where vector borne diseases are a threat in 2009, restricting the concentration of DEET containing repellents to 15% or less, as modelled in the 2010 EU directive, is likely to result in extensive sub-therapeutic activity where repellents are infrequently applied. Future European travellers, as a consequence of inadequate personal protection, could potentially be at increased risk of vector borne diseases. Risk assessments of repellents should take these factors into account when setting safe limits.

19299243|a|We demonstrate successful treatment of recurrent chondroid-metaplastic breast cancer. Breast cancer recurrence was diagnosed when a patient with a history of metaplastic breast cancer presented with recurrent acute strokes. A diagnosis of tumor embolism was suspected when a chest radiograph performed as part of a work-up for stroke demonstrated several lung nodules, with 1 lung nodule invading the pulmonary vein and extending into the left atrium-the source of tumor emboli. This was followed by timely surgery to remove the embolizing metastatic lesion and local radiation to prevent growth and recurrent embolization. Subsequently, the patient received carboplatin and albumin-bound paclitaxel and experienced complete remission.

10402249|t|A new tubulin polymerization inhibitor, auristatin PE, induces tumor regression in a human Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia xenograft model.
10402249|a|Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative disease which remains incurable with current treatment protocols. We have previously established a permanent WM cell line, WSU-WM, which grows as a xenograft in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of auristatin PE (a structural modification of the marine, shell-less mollusk peptide constituent dolastatin 10). WSU-WM cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 at a concentration of 2x10(5) cells/ml using 24-well plates. Auristatin PE or dolastatin 10 were added to triplicate wells and cell count and viability were assessed after 24, 48 and 72 h. Results showed that both agents were active against WSU-WM, and were able to induce complete growth inhibition at 100 pg/ml. The efficacy of these agents in vivo was evaluated using the WSU-WM SCID mouse xenograft model. Auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were given i.v. via tail vein at 2.0 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively. The agents were given every second day for three injections which represent the maximum tolerated doses. Tumor growth inhibition (T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C), and log10 kill for auristatin PE and dolastatin 10 were 0%, 18 days, 2.83 and 67%, 2 days, 0.06, respectively. Based on these animal results, dolastatin 10 was inactive while auristatin PE was highly active. We therefore focused further investigation on auristatin PE to understand some of its mechanisms of action. Using two flow cytometry assays, propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis and 7-amino actinomycin D (7AAD) to detect apoptosis, we were able to demonstrate that auristatin PE at 10 pg/ml after 24 h arrested 50% of WSU-MW cells in G2M. Concomitantly, 31% of auristatin PE-treated cells entered apoptosis. By 72 h, greater than 75% of the cells became apoptotic. The activity of auristatin PE should be evaluated in other tumor types and in clinical trials.

16914992|t|Allergic contact dermatitis in children.
16914992|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The following paper reviews the recent literature pertaining to allergic contact dermatitis in the pediatric population. RECENT FINDINGS: Allergic contact dermatitis may affect as many as 20% of the pediatric population. Recent studies implicate the following chemicals as the most common causes: nickel, topical antibiotics, preservative chemicals, fragrances and rubber accelerators. Several less common, but emerging, allergens have also been reported recently, including para-phenylenediamine in henna tattoos, cocamidopropyl betaine in 'no tears' shampoos and cleansers, and disperse dyes in clothing materials. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs less frequently in the first few months of life and increases in prevalence with increasing age. In the adolescent age group, females have significantly higher rates of allergic contact dermatitis on the face. This is likely explained by increased exposures to nickel in piercings and to preservative and fragrance chemicals in cosmetic products. SUMMARY: The documented rates of allergic contact dermatitis in children are on the rise. This increased prevalence may be due to increased chemical exposures in this age group, better recognition by pediatricians and perhaps more widespread use of epicutaneous patch testing. This review outlines the basic pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of allergic contact dermatitis in children.

7835752|t|Mechanisms of radical formation from reactions of ozone with target molecules in the lung.
7835752|a|Ozone is known to cause radicals to be formed in biological systems: for example, it initiates lipid peroxidation and vitamin E protects in vitro model systems, cells, and animals against the effects of ozone. Ozone is not itself a radical, and we have asked: With what molecules does ozone react in the lung and how are radicals produced? Ozone reacts by two quite different mechanisms to produce radicals; one involves an ozone-olefin reaction and the other a reaction with electron donors such as glutathione (GSH). The first mechanism splits an R radical out of an olefin with the structure R-CH = CH2. The R then reacts with dioxygen to become a peroxyl radical (ROO), and both carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals can be detected by the electron spin resonance spin trap method. From the effects of temperature, metal chelators, and water, it is concluded that ozone reacts by the Criegee ozonation pathway to give the classical 1,2,3-trioxolane, which then undergoes O--O bond homolysis to form a diradical. This diradical then either undergoes beta-scission to split out the R radical or forms the more usual carbonyl oxide and a carbonyl compound. (See Figure 3 in the text). The low yield of Criegee ozonide that is generally obtained probably is due in part to the reactions forming radicals from the 1,2,3-trioxolane that compete with production of the Criegee ozonide. The second mechanism for radical production involves the reaction of ozone with electron donors. If the electron donor is, for example, GSH or its ion (GS-), this reaction produces the thiyl radical GS. and 0.3-. The ozone radical anion then reacts with a proton to form the hydroxyl radical and dioxygen: O3.- + H+-->HO. and O2. Using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, the spin adduct of the hydroxyl radical is detected. Similar reactions are observed with catechol.

10673540|t|Swelling-activated, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-augmented ATP release and Cl- conductances in murine C127 cells.
10673540|a|1. A hypotonic challenge, but not cAMP stimulation, was found to induce release of ATP measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay from both the murine mammary carcinoma cell line C127i and C127 cells stably transfected with the cDNA for human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein (C127/CFTR). CFTR expression augmented swelling-induced ATP release by 10-20 times under hypotonic conditions (< or = 80 % osmolality). 2. Glibenclamide failed to suppress swelling-induced ATP release from C127/CFTR cells. In contrast, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that both the cAMP-activated ohmic Cl- currents and volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) Cl- currents were prominently suppressed by glibenclamide. 3. Gd3+ markedly blocked swelling-induced ATP release but failed to suppress both cAMP- and swelling-activated Cl- currents in the CFTR-expressing cells. Even after pretreatment and during treatment with Gd3+, VSOR Cl- currents were activated normally. 4. The continuous presence of an ATP-hydrolysing enzyme, apyrase, in the bathing solution did not prevent activation of VSOR Cl- currents in C127/CFTR cells. 5. The rate of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in C127/CFTR cells was much faster than that in C127i cells. When apyrase was added to the bathing solution, the RVD rate was retarded in C127/CFTR cells. 6. On balance, the following conclusions can be deduced. First, swelling-induced ATP release is augmented by expression of CFTR but is not mediated by the CFTR Cl- channel. Second, swelling-induced ATP release is not mediated by the VSOR Cl- channel. Third, the released ATP facilitated the RVD process but is not involved in the activation of VSOR Cl- channels in C127/CFTR cells.
