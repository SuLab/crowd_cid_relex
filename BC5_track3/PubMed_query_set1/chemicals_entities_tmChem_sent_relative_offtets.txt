8911706	0	15	28	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	Topical ocular levocabastine reduces ICAM-1 expression on epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro.
8911706	1	12	25	Levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	BACKGROUND: Levocabastine is a selective topical H1 antagonist, effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis.
8911706	2	48	61	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of levocabastine eye drops on early (EPR) and late phase (LPR) inflammatory changes induced by allergen-specific conjunctival challenge (ASCC).
8911706	3	51	64	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	We focused our attention on the possible effect of levocabastine on expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on epithelial cells.
8911706	7	27	40	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	Patients randomly received levocabastine eye drops (0.5 mg/mL) or placebo eyedrops, one drop in the left eye (right eye as control), 30 min before ASCC.
8911706	9	49	62	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	In parallel, we evaluated the in vitro effect of levocabastine at concentrations ranging from 2 x 10(-9) M to 2 x 10(-5) M on ICAM-1 expression and shedding by a continuously cultured differentiated epithelial cell line (WK).
8911706	10	9	22	Levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	RESULTS: Levocabastine reduced symptom scores during EPR (15 min and 30 min, P < 0.002), inflammatory cell infiltration during EPR (P < 0.002 for neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes) and ICAM-1 expression on epithelium both during EPR (P < 0.002) and LPR (P < 0.02).
8911706	11	85	98	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	LPR symptom scores and inflammatory cell infiltration were only slightly modified by levocabastine treatment.
8911706	12	9	22	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	In vitro levocabastine at 2 x 10(-5) M concentration was able to down-regulate basal ICAM-1 expression, although it exerted no effect on ICAM-1 release by epithelium.
8911706	13	12	25	Levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	CONCLUSION: Levocabastine exerts anti-allergic activity, in that it reduces in vivo inflammatory cell infiltration due to ASCC, and also adhesion molecule expression on conjunctival epithelium.
8911706	14	74	87	levocabastine	Chemical	C047340	The latter phenomenon may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect of levocabastine on epithelial cells.

15925031	1	97	106	clonidine	Chemical	D003000	In women meeting strict criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), we examined whether clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist, would have different effects on sexually abused versus non-abused PMDD women for measures of autonomic nervous system function.
15925031	2	223	232	clonidine	Chemical	D003000	Twelve women meeting prospective, DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, five of whom had a history of sexual abuse, participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design study, comparing 2 months of on oral clonidine (0.3 mg/day) with 2 months on active placebo.

15925031	4	48	57	clonidine	Chemical	D003000	Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women.
15925031	4	87	101	norepinephrine	Chemical	D009638	Results revealed that in comparison to placebo, clonidine significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine concentrations, increased both beta1- and beta2-AR responsivity, and reduced resting and stress heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (p < 0.05) in all PMDD women.
15925031	5	5	14	clonidine	Chemical	D003000	With clonidine, sexually abused PMDD women exhibited greater decreases in resting and stress-induced HR (p < 0.01) and stress-induced systolic BP (p < 0.05), while non-abused PMDD women exhibited greater reductions in plasma NE concentration (p = 0.07), and greater increases in beta2-AR responsivity (p < 0.05) than abused PMDD women.
15925031	6	101	110	clonidine	Chemical	D003000	These results suggest PMDD women with and without a history of sexual abuse respond differently to a clonidine challenge in measures reflecting autonomic nervous system functioning, indicating that abuse may modify presynaptic alpha2-AR function in PMDD.

14750216	2	31	39	apigenin	Chemical	D047310	We have reported recently that apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many common fruits and vegetables, has shown remarkable effects in inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many human prostate carcinoma cells.

14750216	4	24	32	apigenin	Chemical	D047310	Treatment of cells with apigenin resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth, colony formation, and G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle.
14750216	6	63	71	apigenin	Chemical	D047310	The induction of WAF1/p21 and its growth inhibitory effects by apigenin appears to be independent of p53 and pRb status of these cells.
14750216	7	0	8	Apigenin	Chemical	D047310	Apigenin treatment also resulted in alteration in Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis, which was associated with the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1).
14750216	8	101	117	poly(ADP-ribose)	Chemical	D011064	This effect was found to result in a significant increase in cleaved fragments of caspase-9, -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).
14750216	9	9	17	apigenin	Chemical	D047310	Further, apigenin treatment resulted in downmodulation of the constitutive expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/p65 and NF-kappaB/p50 in the nuclear fraction that correlated with an increase in the expression of IkappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in the cytosol.
14750216	10	62	70	apigenin	Chemical	D047310	Taken together, we concluded that molecular mechanisms during apigenin-mediated growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in DU145 cells was due to (1) modulation in cell-cycle machinery, (2) disruption of mitochondrial function, and (3) NF-kappaB inhibition.

15041316	4	53	56	CsA	Chemical	CHEBI:55379	This can partly be attributed to the side effects of CsA and partly to the fact that the use of CsA has not led to a reduced incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy.

23783141	1	0	9	Cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of solid tumours including small cell lung cancers, but its success is often compromised by relapse and resistance to further treatment.
23783141	4	212	221	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	Although individually targeting the ERK1/2 or Akt pathway has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to therapy, the effect of concurrently blocking these two pathways on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to cisplatin has not been investigated.
23783141	5	94	103	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways contribute to cisplatin resistance in human small cell lung cancer A549 cells.
23783141	6	24	33	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	The results showed that cisplatin activates p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt in A549 cells.
23783141	7	98	107	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	Blockade of either of these pathways with chemical inhibitors moderately sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability.
23783141	8	82	91	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	Strikingly, concurrent inhibition of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt significantly potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
23783141	9	35	44	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	The sensitization of A549 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity induced by p-Akt inhibition was mediated by the upregulation of PUMA, whereas that induced by p-ERK1/2 inhibition occurred by Bcl-2 downregulation.
23783141	10	86	95	cisplatin	Chemical	D002945	These data indicate that the cooperative effects of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt on attenuating cisplatin cytotoxicity are mediated by PUMA and Bcl-2 regulation, and concurrently blocking these pathways may be an effective strategy for improving the efficacy of cisplatin as anticancer treatment.

12136223	15	8	11	BPs	Chemical		Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing.
12136223	18	108	111	BPs	Chemical		Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients.

11204550	1	12	27	Diphenhydramine	Chemical	D004155	BACKGROUND: Diphenhydramine (DPHM) overdose is a frequent cause of acute poisoning.
11204550	1	29	33	DPHM	Chemical		BACKGROUND: Diphenhydramine (DPHM) overdose is a frequent cause of acute poisoning.
11204550	2	96	100	DPHM	Chemical		Although its clinical features are well known, information about the dose-dependent toxicity of DPHM is still scarce.
11204550	3	78	82	DPHM	Chemical		The objective of this study was to investigate the dose-dependent toxicity of DPHM in patients with acute DPHM poisoning.
11204550	3	106	110	DPHM	Chemical		The objective of this study was to investigate the dose-dependent toxicity of DPHM in patients with acute DPHM poisoning.
11204550	4	73	77	DPHM	Chemical		METHODS: We have analyzed retrospectively all well-documented cases with DPHM monointoxications reported by physicians to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre (STIC) between January 1984 and April 1996.
11204550	5	54	58	DPHM	Chemical		In addition, a prospective study focusing on ingested DPHM doses and severity of symptoms was performed between May 1996 and December 1998.
11204550	6	85	89	DPHM	Chemical		RESULTS: The retrospective and prospective studies included 232 and 50 patients with DPHM monointoxications, respectively.
11204550	8	57	61	DPHM	Chemical		Moderate symptoms occurred above ingested doses of 0.3 g DPHM.
11204550	9	54	58	DPHM	Chemical		For severe symptoms the critical dose limit was 1.0 g DPHM.
11204550	11	77	81	DPHM	Chemical		CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a clear dose-dependent acute toxicity of DPHM.
11204550	12	38	42	DPHM	Chemical		They indicate that only patients with DPHM ingestions above 1.0 g are at risk for the development of severe symptoms and, therefore, should be hospitalized.
11204550	13	105	109	DPHM	Chemical		Thus, the results contribute to the data basis required for a cost effective management of patients with DPHM overdose.
9921434	4	114	124	chloroform	Chemical	D002725	The contribution of drug-induced hepatic damage to postoperative hepatic dysfunction has remained unsettled since chloroform was first incriminated during the nineteenth century.

9921434	8	118	128	chloroform	Chemical	D002725	Babior and Davidson noted that it was the first drug implicated in hepatic necrosis--presumably with the exception of chloroform--the first report appearing in 1922.
9921434	9	114	123	cincophen	Chemical		In 1941 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association concluded that the case against cincophen was not proved and that an urgent need existed for controlled clinical studies.
9921434	12	36	45	halothane	Chemical	D006221	Perhaps an anesthetic agent such as halothane, concerning multiple administrations of which there is currently serious question, would be a suitable choice for such a study.
9921434	18	94	103	Halothane	Chemical	D006221	Just as we have conducted the definitive retrospective hypothesis-testing study--the National Halothane Study--demanded by the "halothane hepatitis" controversy, so must we now move to the final stage of epidemiological investigation (experimental epidemiology) by investigating the effects of multiple administrations of the drug.

12044126	2	29	36	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	The traditional view is that cocaine causes a hypermetabolic state with increased heat production.

12044126	4	34	41	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of cocaine on body temperature regulation in humans.
12044126	7	25	32	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	PARTICIPANTS: 7 healthy, cocaine-naive volunteers.
12044126	8	97	104	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	INTERVENTION: Progressive passive heat stress, during which each participant received intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo (lidocaine, 2 mg/kg).

12044126	11	7	14	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	First, cocaine substantially augmented the progressive increase in esophageal temperature during heat stress (P < 0.001).
12044126	12	176	183	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	Second, this augmentation was explained by a rightward shift in the esophageal temperature threshold for the onset of both cutaneous vasodilation (37.37 +/- 0.09 degrees C for cocaine vs. 37.06 +/- 0.07 degrees C for lidocaine; P = 0.01) and sweating (37.38 +/- 0.09 degrees C for cocaine vs. 37.07 +/- 0.06 degrees C for lidocaine; P = 0.002).

12044126	13	7	14	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	Third, cocaine paradoxically impaired the perception of heating by attenuating the progressive increase in thermal discomfort associated with heat stress.
12044126	14	80	87	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	CONCLUSIONS: In humans, impaired heat dissipation is a major mechanism by which cocaine elevates body temperature.
12044126	15	14	21	cocaine	Chemical	D003042	When healthy, cocaine-naive persons are subjected to passive heating, pretreatment with even a small dose of intranasal cocaine impairs sweating and cutaneous vasodilation (the major autonomic adjustments to thermal stress) and heat perception (the key trigger for behavioral adjustments).

7697699	5	38	49	sumatriptan	Chemical	D018170	Since the vasoconstrictor response of sumatriptan is reproducible outside the migraine attack, this action appears to be a direct vascular effect and not indirectly mediated via neural mechanisms.
